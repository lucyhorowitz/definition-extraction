The slogan of Saunders Mac Lane's book Categories for the Working Mathematician is: Adjoint functors arise everywhere. We will see the truth of this, meeting examples of adjoint functors from diverse parts of mathematics. To complement the understanding provided by examples, we will approach the theory of adjoints from three different directions, each of which carries its own intuition. Then we will prove that the three approaches are equivalent. Understanding adjointness gives you a valuable addition to your mathematical toolkit. Most professional pure mathematicians know what categories and functors are, but far fewer know about adjoints. More should: adjoint functors are both common and easy, and knowing about adjoints helps you to spot patterns in the mathematical landscape. Consider a pair of functors in opposite directions, $ Ffrom cat{A} to cat{B} $ and $ Gfrom cat{B} to cat{A} $ . Roughly speaking, $ F $ is said to be left adjoint to $ G $ if, whenever $ A in cat{A} $ and $ B in cat{B} $ , maps $ F(A) to B $ are essentially the same thing as maps $ A to G(B) $ . Let $ oppairi{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ be categories and functors. We say that $ F $ is left adjoint to $ G $ , and $ G $ is right adjoint to $ F $ , and write $ F ladj G $ , if $ cat{B}(F(A), B) iso cat{A}(A, G(B)) $ naturally in $ A in cat{A} $ and $ B in cat{B} $ . The meaning of `naturally' is defined below. An adjunction between $ F $ and $ G $ is a choice of natural isomorphism $ X $ . `Naturally in $ A in cat{A} $ and $ B in cat{B} $ ' means that there is a specified bijection $ X $ for each $ A in cat{A} $ and $ B in cat{B} $ , and that it satisfies a naturality axiom. To state it, we need some notation. Given objects $ A in cat{A} $ and $ B in cat{B} $ , the correspondence $ X $ between maps $ F(A) to B $ and $ A to G(B) $ is denoted by a horizontal bar, in both directions: $ {ccc} Bigl(F(A) toby{g} BBigr) & mapsto & Bigl(A toby{bar{g}} G(B)Bigr),  Bigl(F(A) toby{bar{f}} BBigr) & mapsfrom & Bigl(A toby{f} G(B)Bigr). $ So $ bar{bar{f}} = f $ and $ bar{bar{g}} = g $ . We call $ bar{f} $ the transpose of $ f $ , and similarly for $ g $ . The naturality axiom has two parts: $ ovln{Bigl(F(A) toby{g} B toby{q} B'Bigr)} quad = quad Bigl(A toby{bar{g}} G(B) toby{G(q)} G(B')Bigr) $ (that is, $ ovln{q of g} = G(q) of bar{g} $ ) for all $ g $ and $ q $ , and $ ovln{Bigl(A' toby{p} A toby{f} G(B)Bigr)} quad = quad Bigl(F(A') toby{F(p)} F(A) toby{bar{f}} BBigr) $ for all $ p $ and $ f $ . It makes no difference whether we put the long bar over the left or the right of these equations, since bar is self - inverse. [(b)] The naturality axiom might seem ad hoc, but we will see in Chapter $ X $ that it simply says that two particular functors are naturally isomorphic. In this section, we ignore the naturality axiom altogether, trusting that it embodies our usual intuitive idea of naturality: something defined without making any arbitrary choices. The naturality axiom implies that from each array of maps $ A_0 to cdots to A_n, quad F(A_n) to B_0, quad B_0 to cdots to B_m, $ it is possible to construct exactly one map $ A_0 to G(B_m). $ Compare the comments on the definitions of category, functor and natural transformation (Remarks $ X $ , , and $ X $ ). Not only do adjoint functors arise everywhere; better, whenever you see a pair of functors $ cat{A}oppairu cat{B} $ , there is an excellent chance that they are adjoint (one way round or the other). For example, suppose you get talking to a mathematician who tells you that her work involves Lie algebras and associative algebras. You try to object that you don't know what either of those things is, but she carries on talking anyway, explaining that there's a way of turning any Lie algebra into an associative algebra, and also a way of turning any associative algebra into a Lie algebra. At this point, even without knowing what she's talking about, you should bet her that one process is adjoint to the other. This almost always works. A given functor $ G $ may or may not have a left adjoint, but if it does, it is unique up to isomorphism, so we may speak of `the left adjoint of $ G $ '. The same goes for right adjoints. We prove this later (Example $ X $ ). You might ask `what do we gain from knowing that two functors are adjoint?' The uniqueness is a crucial part of the answer. Let us return to the example of $ X $ . It would take you only a few minutes to learn what Lie algebras are, what associative algebras are, and what the standard functor $ G $ is that turns an associative algebra into a Lie algebra. What about the functor $ F $ in the opposite direction? The description of $ F $ that you will find in most algebra books (under `universal enveloping algebra') takes much longer to understand. However, you can bypass that process completely, just by knowing that $ F $ is the left adjoint of $ G $ . Since $ G $ can have only one left adjoint, this characterizes $ F $ completely. In a sense, it tells you all you need to know. [Algebra: free $ ladj $ forgetful] Forgetful functors between categories of algebraic structures usually have left adjoints. For instance: [(b)] Let $ k $ be a field. There is an adjunction $ adjn{Vect_k}{Set, }{F}{U} $ where $ U $ is the forgetful functor of Example $ X $ and $ F $ is the free functor of Example $ X $ . Adjointness says that given a set $ S $ and a vector space $ V $ , a linear map $ F(S) to V $ is essentially the same thing as a function $ S to U(V) $ . We saw this in Example $ X $ , but let us now check it in detail. Fix a set $ S $ and a vector space $ V $ . Given a linear map $ gfrom F(S) to V $ , we may define a map of sets $ bar{g}from S to U(V) $ by $ bar{g}(s) = g(s) $ for all $ s in S $ . This gives a function $ {ccc} Vect_k(F(S), V) &to &Set(S, U(V))  g &mapsto &bar{g}. $ In the other direction, given a map of sets $ ffrom S to U(V) $ , we may define a linear map $ bar{f}from F(S) to V $ by $ bar{f} bigl( sum_{s in S} lambda_s s bigr) = sum_{s in S} lambda_s f(s) $ for all formal linear combinations $ sum lambda_s s in F(S) $ . This gives a function $ {ccc} Set(S, U(V)) &to &Vect_k(F(S), V)  f &mapsto &bar{f}. $ These two functions `bar' are mutually inverse: for any linear map $ gfrom F(S) to V $ , we have $ bar{bar{g}} Biggl( sum_{s in S} lambda_s s Biggr) = sum_{s in S} lambda_s bar{g}(s) = sum_{s in S} lambda_s g(s) = g Biggl( sum_{s in S} lambda_s s Biggr) $ for all $ sum lambda_s s in F(S) $ , so $ bar{bar{g}} = g $ , and for any map of sets $ ffrom S to U(V) $ , we have $ bar{bar{f}}(s) = bar{f}(s) = f(s) $ for all $ s in S $ , so $ bar{bar{f}} = f $ . We therefore have a canonical bijection between $ Vect_k(F(S), V) $ and $ Set(S, U(V)) $ for each $ S in Set $ and $ V in Vect_k $ , as required. Here we have been careful to distinguish between the vector space $ V $ and its underlying set $ U(V) $ . Very often, though, in category theory as in mathematics at large, the symbol for a forgetful functor is omitted. In this example, that would mean dropping the $ U $ and leaving the reader to figure out whether each occurrence of $ V $ is intended to denote the vector space itself or its underlying set. We will soon start using such notational shortcuts ourselves. In the same way, there is an adjunction $ adjn{Grp}{Set}{F}{U} $ where $ F $ and $ U $ are the free and forgetful functors of Examples $ X $ and $ X $ . The free group functor is tricky to construct explicitly. In Chapter $ X $ , we will prove a result (the general adjoint functor theorem) guaranteeing that $ U $ and many functors like it all have left adjoints. To some extent, this removes the need to construct $ F $ explicitly, as observed in Remark $ X $ . The point can be overstated: for a group theorist, the more descriptions of free groups that are available, the better. Explicit constructions really can be useful. But it is an important general principle that forgetful functors of this type always have left adjoints. There is an adjunction $ adjn{Ab}{Grp}{F}{U} $ where $ U $ is the inclusion functor of Example $ X $ . If $ G $ is a group then $ F(G) $ is the abelianization $ abel{G} $ of $ G $ . This is an abelian quotient group of $ G $ , with the property that every map from $ G $ to an abelian group factorizes uniquely through $ abel{G} $ : $ xymatrix{ G ar[r]^ - eta ar[dr]_{forallphi} & abel{G} ar@{.>}[d]^{exists!bar{phi}}  & forall A. } $ Here $ eta $ is the natural map from $ G $ to its quotient $ abel{G} $ , and $ A $ is any abelian group. (We have adopted the abuse of notation advertised in example $ X $ , omitting the symbol $ U $ at several places in this diagram.) The bijection $ Ab(abel{G}, A) iso Grp(G, U(A)) $ is given in the left - to - right direction by $ psi mapsto psiofeta $ , and in the right - to - left direction by $ phi mapsto bar{phi} $ . (To construct $ abel{G} $ , let $ G' $ be the smallest normal subgroup of $ G $ containing $ xyx^{ - 1}y^{ - 1} $ for all $ x, y in G $ , and put $ abel{G} = G/G' $ . The kernel of any homomorphism from $ G $ to an abelian group contains $ G' $ , and the universal property follows.) There are adjunctions $ xymatrix{ Grp ar[d]|{Uvphantom{gl'}}  Mon ar@<3ex>[u]^F_ladj ar@< - 3ex>[u]_R^ladj } $ between the categories of groups and monoids. The middle functor $ U $ is inclusion. The left adjoint $ F $ is, again, tricky to describe explicitly. Informally, $ F(M) $ is obtained from $ M $ by throwing in an inverse to every element. (For example, if $ M $ is the additive monoid of natural numbers then $ F(M) $ is the group of integers.) Again, the general adjoint functor theorem (Theorem $ X $ ) guarantees the existence of this adjoint. This example is unusual in that forgetful functors do not usually have right adjoints. Here, given a monoid $ M $ , the group $ R(M) $ is the submonoid of $ M $ consisting of all the invertible elements. The category $ Grp $ is both a reflective and a coreflective subcategory of $ Mon $ . This means, by definition, that the inclusion functor $ Grp incl Mon $ has both a left and a right adjoint. The previous example tells us that $ Ab $ is a reflective subcategory of $ Grp $ . Let $ Field $ be the category of fields, with ring homomorphisms as the maps. The forgetful functor $ Field to Set $ does not have a left adjoint. (For a proof, see Example $ X $ .) The theory of fields is unlike the theories of groups, rings, and so on, because the operation $ x mapsto x^{ - 1} $ is not defined for all $ x $ (only for $ x neq 0 $ ). At several points in this book, we make contact with the idea of an demph{algebraic theory}. You already know several examples: the theory of groups is an algebraic theory, as are the theory of rings, the theory of vector spaces over $ reals $ , the theory of vector spaces over $ complexes $ , the theory of monoids, and (rather trivially) the theory of sets. After reading the description below, you might conclude that the word `theory' is overly grand, and that `definition' would be more appropriate. Nevertheless, this is the established usage. We will not need to define `algebraic theory' formally, but it will be important to have the general idea. Let us begin by considering the theory of groups. A group can be defined as a set $ X $ equipped with a function $ cdot from X times X to X $ (multiplication), another function $ blank^{ - 1}from X to X $ (inverse), and an element $ e in X $ (the identity), satisfying a familiar list of equations. More systematically, the three pieces of structure on $ X $ can be seen as maps of sets $ cdotfrom X^2 to X, qquad blank^{ - 1}from X^1 to X, qquad efrom X^0 to X, $ where in the last case, $ X^0 $ is the one - element set $ 1 $ and we are using the observation that a map $ 1 to X $ of sets is essentially the same thing as an element of $ X $ . (You may be more familiar with a definition of group in which only the multiplication and perhaps the identity are specified as pieces of structure, with the existence of inverses required as a property. In that approach, the definition is swiftly followed by a lemma on uniqueness of inverses, guaranteeing that it makes sense to speak of the inverse of an element. The two approaches are equivalent, but for many purposes, it is better to frame the definition in the way described in the previous paragraph.) An algebraic theory consists of two things: first, a collection of operations, each with a specified arity (number of inputs), and second, a collection of equations. For example, the theory of groups has one operation of arity $ 2 $ , one of arity $ 1 $ , and one of arity $ 0 $ . An algebra or model for an algebraic theory consists of a set $ X $ together with a specified map $ X^n to X $ for each operation of arity $ n $ , such that the equations hold everywhere. For example, an algebra for the theory of groups is exactly a group. A more subtle example is the theory of vector spaces over $ reals $ . This is an algebraic theory with, among other things, an infinite number of operations of arity $ 1 $ : for each $ lambda in reals $ , we have the operation $ lambda cdot dashbkfrom X to X $ of scalar multiplication by $ lambda $ (for any vector space $ X $ ). There is nothing special about the field $ reals $ here; the only point is that it was chosen in advance. The theory of vector spaces over $ reals $ is different from the theory of vector spaces over $ complexes $ , because they have different operations of arity $ 1 $ . In a nutshell, the main property of algebras for an algebraic theory is that the operations are defined everywhere on the set, and the equations hold everywhere too. For example, every element of a group has a specified inverse, and every element $ x $ satisfies the equation $ x cdot x^{ - 1} = 1 $ . This is why the theories of groups, rings, and so on, are algebraic theories, but the theory of fields is not. There are adjunctions $ xymatrix{ Tp ar[d]|{Uvphantom{gl'}}  Set ar@<3ex>[u]^D_ladj ar@< - 3ex>[u]_I^ladj } $ where $ U $ sends a space to its set of points, $ D $ equips a set with the discrete topology, and $ I $ equips a set with the indiscrete topology. Given sets $ A $ and $ B $ , we can form their (cartesian) product $ A times B $ . We can also form the set $ B^A $ of functions from $ A $ to $ B $ . This is the same as the set $ Set(A, B) $ , but we tend to use the notation $ B^A $ when we want to emphasize that it is an object of the same category as $ A $ and $ B $ . Now fix a set $ B $ . Taking the product with $ B $ defines a functor $ {cccc} dashbk times Bfrom &Set &to &Set  &A &mapsto&A times B. $ (Here we are using the blank notation introduced in Example $ X $ .) There is also a functor $ {cccc} (dashbk)^Bfrom &Set &to &Set  &C &mapsto&C^B. $ Moreover, there is a canonical bijection $ Set(A times B, C) iso Set(A, C^B) $ for any sets $ A $ and $ C $ . It is defined by simply changing the punctuation: given a map $ gfrom A times B to C $ , define $ bar{g}from A to C^B $ by $ (bar{g}(a))(b) = g(a, b) $ ( $ a in A $ , $ b in B $ ), and in the other direction, given $ ffrom A to C^B $ , define $ bar{f}from A times B to C $ by $ bar{f}(a, b) = (f(a))(b) $ ( $ a in A $ , $ b in B $ ). Figure $ X $ shows an example with $ A = B = C = reals $ . By slicing up the surface as shown, a map $ reals^2 to reals $ can be seen as a map from $ reals $ to $ {text{maps } reals to reals } $ . Putting all this together, we obtain an adjunction $ adjn{Set}{Set}{dashbktimes B}{(dashbk)^B} $ for every set $ B $ . centering setlength{unitlength}{1em} (10, 1(i)5)( - 5, - .8) cell{0}{0}{b}{includegraphics[width=10em]{curry}} cell{(iii)8}{ - 0.2}{c}{A} cell{(ii)2}{(v)8}{c}{B} cell{ - (iv)1}{(x)1}{c}{C} caption{In $ Set $ , a map $ A times B to C $ can be seen as a way of assigning to each element of $ A $ a map $ B to C $ .} Let $ cat{A} $ be a category. An object $ I in cat{A} $ is initial if for every $ A in cat{A} $ , there is exactly one map $ I to A $ . An object $ T in cat{A} $ is terminal if for every $ A in cat{A} $ , there is exactly one map $ A to T $ . For example, the empty set is initial in $ Set $ , the trivial group is initial in $ Grp $ , and $ integers $ is initial in $ Ring $ (Example $ X $ ). The one - element set is terminal in $ Set $ , the trivial group is terminal (as well as initial) in $ Grp $ , and the trivial (one - element) ring is terminal in $ Ring $ . The terminal object of $ CAT $ is the category $ One $ containing just one object and one map (necessarily the identity on that object). A category need not have an initial object, but if it does have one, it is unique up to isomorphism. Indeed, it is unique up to unique isomorphism, as follows. Let $ I $ and $ I' $ be initial objects of a category. Then there is a unique isomorphism $ I to I' $ . In particular, $ I iso I' $ . Since $ I $ is initial, there is a unique map $ ffrom I to I' $ . Since $ I' $ is initial, there is a unique map $ f'from I' to I $ . Now $ f' of f $ and $ 1_I $ are both maps $ I to I $ , and $ I $ is initial, so $ f' of f = 1_I $ . Similarly, $ f of f' = 1_{I'} $ . Hence $ f $ is an isomorphism, as required. Initial and terminal objects can be described as adjoints. Let $ cat{A} $ be a category. There is precisely one functor $ cat{A} to One $ . Also, a functor $ One to cat{A} $ is essentially just an object of $ cat{A} $ (namely, the object to which the unique object of $ One $ is mapped). Viewing functors $ One to cat{A} $ as objects of $ cat{A} $ , a left adjoint to $ cat{A} to One $ is exactly an initial object of $ cat{A} $ . Similarly, a right adjoint to the unique functor $ cat{A} to One $ is exactly a terminal object of $ cat{A} $ . In the language introduced in Remark $ X $ , the concept of terminal object is dual to the concept of initial object. (More generally, the concepts of left and right adjoint are dual to one another.) Since any two initial objects of a category are uniquely isomorphic, the principle of duality implies that the same is true of terminal objects. Adjunctions can be composed. Take adjunctions $ xymatrix{ cat{A} ar@<(i)1ex>[r]^F_bot & cat{A}' ar@<(i)1ex>[l]^G ar@<(i)1ex>[r]^{F'}_bot & cat{A}'' ar@<(i)1ex>[l]^{G'} } $ where the $ bot $ symbol is a rotated $ ladj $ (thus, $ F ladj G $ and $ F' ladj G' $ ). Then we obtain an adjunction $ xymatrix{ cat{A} ar@<(i)1ex>[r]^{F' of F}_bot & cat{A}'', ar@<(i)1ex>[l]^{G of G'} } $ since for $ A in cat{A} $ and $ A'' in cat{A}'' $ , $ cat{A}''bigl( F'(F(A)), A''bigr) iso cat{A}'bigl(F(A), G'(A'')bigr) iso cat{A}bigl(A, G(G'(A''))bigr) $ naturally in $ A $ and $ A'' $ . exs Find three examples of adjoint functors not mentioned above. Do the same for initial and terminal objects. What can be said about adjunctions between discrete categories? Show that the naturality equations $ X $ and $ X $ can equivalently be replaced by the single equation $ ovln{Bigl( A' toby{p} A toby{f} G(B) toby{G(q)} G(B') Bigr)} quad = quad Bigl(F(A') toby{F(p)} F(A) toby{bar{f}} B toby{q} B'Bigr) $ for all $ p $ , $ f $ and $ q $ . Show that left adjoints preserve initial objects: that is, if $ hadjnli{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ and $ I $ is an initial object of $ cat{A} $ , then $ F(I) $ is an initial object of $ cat{B} $ . Dually, show that right adjoints preserve terminal objects. (In Section $ X $ , we will see this as part of a bigger picture: right adjoints preserve limits and left adjoints preserve colimits.) Let $ G $ be a group. [(b)] What interesting functors are there (in either direction) between $ Set $ and the category $ ftrcat{G}{Set} $ of left $ G $ - sets? Which of those functors are adjoint to which? Similarly, what interesting functors are there between $ Vect_k $ and the category $ ftrcat{G}{Vect_k} $ of $ k $ - linear representations of $ G $ , and what adjunctions are there between those functors? Fix a topological space $ X $ , and write $ oset(X) $ for the poset of open subsets of $ X $ , ordered by inclusion. Let $ Delta from Set to ftrcat{oset(X)^op}{Set} $ be the functor assigning to a set $ A $ the presheaf $ Delta A $ with constant value $ A $ . Exhibit a chain of adjoint functors $ Lambda ladj Pi ladj Delta ladj Gamma ladj nabla. $ In the previous section, we met the definition of adjunction. In this section and the next, we meet two ways of rephrasing the definition. The one in this section is most useful for theoretical purposes, while the one in the next fits well with many examples. To start building the theory of adjoint functors, we have to take seriously the naturality requirement (equations $ X $ and $ X $ ), which has so far been ignored. Take an adjunction $ hadjnli{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ . Intuitively, naturality says that as $ A $ varies in $ cat{A} $ and $ B $ varies in $ cat{B} $ , the isomorphism between $ cat{B}(F(A), B) $ and $ cat{A}(A, G(B)) $ varies in a way that is compatible with all the structure already in place. In other words, it is compatible with composition in the categories $ cat{A} $ and $ cat{B} $ and the action of the functors $ F $ and $ G $ . But what does `compatible' mean? Suppose, for example, that we have maps $ F(A) toby{g} B toby{q} B' $ in $ cat{B} $ . There are two things we can do with this data: either compose then take the transpose, which produces a map $ ovln{q of g}from A to G(B') $ , or take the transpose of $ g $ then compose it with $ G(q) $ , which produces a potentially different map $ G(q) of bar{g}from A to G(B') $ . Compatibility means that they are equal; and that is the first naturality equation $ X $ . The second is its dual, and can be explained in a similar way. For each $ A in cat{A} $ , we have a map $ Bigl( A toby{eta_A} GF(A) Bigr) = ovln{Bigl(F(A) toby{1} F(A)Bigr)}. $ Dually, for each $ B in cat{B} $ , we have a map $ Bigl( FG(B) toby{epsln_B} B Bigr) = ovln{Bigl(G(B) toby{1} G(B)Bigr)}. $ (We have begun to omit brackets, writing $ GF(A) $ instead of $ G(F(A)) $ , etc.) These define natural transformations $ etafrom 1_cat{A} to G of F, qquad epslnfrom F of G to 1_cat{B}, $ called the unit and counit of the adjunction, respectively. Take the usual adjunction $ hadjnri{Vect_k}{Set}{U}{F} $ . Its unit $ etafrom 1_Set to U of F $ has components $ {ccccl} eta_Sfrom &S &to &UF(S) & !!!! = bigl{ text{formal }ktext{ - linear sums } sum_{s in S} lambda_s s bigr }  &s &mapsto &s $ ( $ S in Set $ ). The component of the counit $ epsln $ at a vector space $ V $ is the linear map $ epsln_Vfrom FU(V) to V $ that sends a formal linear sum $ sum_{v in V} lambda_v v $ to its actual value in $ V $ . The vector space $ FU(V) $ is enormous. For instance, if $ k = reals $ and $ V $ is the vector space $ reals^2 $ , then $ U(V) $ is the set $ reals^2 $ and $ FU(V) $ is a vector space with one basis element for every element of $ reals^2 $ ; thus, it is uncountably infinite - dimensional. Then $ epsln_V $ is a map from this infinite - dimensional space to the $ 2 $ - dimensional space $ V $ . Given an adjunction $ F ladj G $ with unit $ eta $ and counit $ epsln $ , the triangles $ {c} xymatrix{ F ar[r]^ - {Feta} ar[dr]_{1_F} & FGF ar[d]^{epsln F}  & F } qquad {c} xymatrix{ G ar[r]^ - {eta G} ar[dr]_{1_G} & GFG ar[d]^{G epsln}  & G } $ commute. These are called the demph{triangle identities}. They are commutative diagrams in the functor categories $ ftrcat{cat{A}}{cat{B}} $ and $ ftrcat{cat{B}}{cat{A}} $ , respectively. For an explanation of the notation, see Remarks $ X $ (particularly the special cases mentioned on page $ X $ ). An equivalent statement is that the triangles $ {c} xymatrix{ F(A) ar[r]^ - {F(eta_A)} ar[dr]_{1_{F(A)}} & FGF(A) ar[d]^{epsln_{F(A)}}  & F(A) } qquad {c} xymatrix{ G(B) ar[r]^ - {eta_{G(B)}} ar[dr]_{1_{G(B)}} & GFG(B) ar[d]^{G(epsln_B)}  & G(B) } $ commute for all $ A in cat{A} $ and $ B in cat{B} $ . {Lemma $ X $ } We prove that the triangles $ X $ commute. Let $ A in cat{A} $ . Since $ ovln{1_{GF(A)}} = epsln_{F(A)} $ , equation $ X $ gives $ ovln{Bigl(A toby{eta_A} GF(A) toby{1} GF(A)Bigr)} quad = quad Bigl( F(A) toby{F(eta_A)} FGF(A) toby{epsln_{F(A)}} F(A) Bigr). $ But the left - hand side is $ ovln{eta_A} = ovln{ovln{1_{F(A)}}} = 1_{F(A)} $ , proving the first identity. The second follows by duality. Amazingly, the unit and counit determine the whole adjunction, even though they appear to know only the transposes of identities. This is the main content of the following pair of results. Let $ hadjnli{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ be an adjunction, with unit $ eta $ and counit $ epsln $ . Then $ bar{g} = G(g) of eta_A $ for any $ gfrom F(A) to B $ , and $ bar{f} = epsln_B of F(f) $ for any $ ffrom A to G(B) $ . For any map $ g from F(A) to B $ , we have ovln{Bigl(F(A) toby{g} BBigr)} & = ovln{Bigl(F(A) toby{1} F(A) toby{g} BBigr)}  & = Bigl( A toby{eta_A} GF(A) toby{G(g)} G(B) Bigr) by equation $ X $ , giving the first statement. The second follows by duality. Take categories and functors $ oppairi{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ . There is a one - to - one correspondence between: [(b)] adjunctions between $ F $ and $ G $ (with $ F $ on the left and $ G $ on the right); pairs $ Bigl(1_cat{A} toby{eta} GF,  FG toby{epsln} 1_cat{B}Bigr) $ of natural transformations satisfying the triangle identities. (Recall that by definition, an adjunction between $ F $ and $ G $ is a choice of isomorphism $ X $ for each $ A $ and $ B $ , satisfying the naturality equations $ X $ and $ X $ .) We have shown that every adjunction between $ F $ and $ G $ gives rise to a pair $ (eta, epsln) $ satisfying the triangle identities. We now have to show that this process is bijective. So, take a pair $ (eta, epsln) $ of natural transformations satisfying the triangle identities. We must show that there is a unique adjunction between $ F $ and $ G $ with unit $ eta $ and counit $ epsln $ . Uniqueness follows from Lemma $ X $ . For existence, take natural transformations $ eta $ and $ epsln $ as in $ X $ . For each $ A $ and $ B $ , define functions $ cat{B}(F(A), B) oppairu cat{A}(A, G(B)), $ both denoted by a bar, as follows. Given $ g in cat{B}(F(A), B) $ , put $ bar{g} = G(g) of eta_A in cat{A}(A, G(B)) $ . Similarly, in the opposite direction, put $ bar{f} = epsln_B of F(f) $ . I claim that for each $ A $ and $ B $ , the two functions $ g mapsto bar{g} $ and $ f mapsto bar{f} $ are mutually inverse. Indeed, given a map $ gfrom F(A) to B $ in $ cat{B} $ , we have a commutative diagram $ xymatrix{ F(A) ar[r]^ - {F(eta_A)} ar[rd]_1 & FGF(A) ar[d]^{epsln_{F(A)}} ar[r]^ - {FG(g)} & FG(B) ar[d]^{epsln_B}  & F(A) ar[r]_ - g & B.} $ The composite map from $ F(A) $ to $ B $ by one route around the outside of the diagram is $ epsln_B of FG(g) of F(eta_A) = epsln_B of F(bar{g}) = bar{bar{g}}, $ and by the other is $ g of 1 = g $ , so $ bar{bar{g}} = g $ . Dually, $ bar{bar{f}} = f $ for any map $ ffrom A to G(B) $ in $ cat{A} $ . This proves the claim. It is straightforward to check the naturality equations $ X $ and $ X $ . The functions $ X $ therefore define an adjunction. Finally, its unit and counit are $ eta $ and $ epsln $ , since the component of the unit at $ A $ is $ ovln{1_{F(A)}} = G(1_{F(A)}) of eta_A = 1 of eta_A = eta_A, $ and dually for the counit. Take categories and functors $ oppairi{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ . Then $ F ladj G $ if and only if there exist natural transformations $ 1 toby{eta} GF $ and $ FG toby{epsln} 1 $ satisfying the triangle identities. qed An adjunction between ordered sets consists of order - pre - serv - ing maps $ oppairi{A}{B}{f}{g} $ such that $ forall a in A, , forall b in B, qquad f(a) leq b iff a leq g(b). $ This is because both sides of the isomorphism $ X $ in the definition of adjunction are sets with at most one element, so they are isomorphic if and only if they are both empty or both nonempty. The naturality requirements $ X $ and $ X $ hold automatically, since in an ordered set, any two maps with the same domain and codomain are equal. Recall from Example $ X $ that if $ parpair{C}{D}{p}{q} $ are order - preserving maps of ordered sets then there is at most one natural transformation from $ p $ to $ q $ , and there is one if and only if $ p(c) leq q(c) $ for all $ c in C $ . The unit of the adjunction above is the statement that $ a leq gf(a) $ for all $ a in A $ , and the counit is the statement that $ fg(b) leq b $ for all $ b in B $ . The triangle identities say nothing, since they assert the equality of two maps in an ordered set with the same domain and codomain. In the case of ordered sets, Corollary $ X $ states that condition $ X $ is equivalent to: $ forall a in A,  a leq gf(a) qquad text{ and } qquad forall b in B,  fg(b) leq b. $ This equivalence can also be proved directly (Exercise $ X $ ). For instance, let $ X $ be a topological space. Take the set $ cset(X) $ of closed subsets of $ X $ and the set $ pset(X) $ of all subsets of $ X $ , both ordered by $ sub $ . There are order - preserving maps $ oppair{pset(X)}{cset(X)}{Cl}{i} $ where $ i $ is the inclusion map and $ Cl $ is closure. This is an adjunction, with $ Cl $ left adjoint to $ i $ , as witnessed by the fact that $ Cl(A) sub B iff A sub B $ for all $ A sub X $ and closed $ B sub X $ . An equivalent statement is that $ A sub Cl(A) $ for all $ A sub X $ and $ Cl(B) sub B $ for all closed $ B sub X $ . Either way, we see that the topological operation of closure arises as an adjoint functor. Theorem $ X $ states that an adjunction may be regarded as a quadruple $ (F, G, eta, epsln) $ of functors and natural transformations satisfying the triangle identities. An equivalence $ (F, G, eta, epsln) $ of categories (as in Definition ) is not necessarily an adjunction. It is true that $ F $ is left adjoint to $ G $ (Exercise $ X $ ), but $ eta $ and $ epsln $ are not necessarily the unit and counit (because there is no reason why they should satisfy the triangle identities). There is a way of drawing natural transformations that makes the triangle identities intuitively plausible. Suppose, for instance, that we have categories and functors $ cat{A} toby{F_1} cat{C}_1 toby{F_2} cat{C}_2 toby{F_3} cat{C}_3 toby{F_4} cat{B}, qquad cat{A} toby{G_1} cat{D}_1 toby{G_2} cat{B} $ and a natural transformation $ alphafrom F_4 F_3 F_2 F_1 to G_2 G_1 $ . We usually draw $ alpha $ like this: $ ( - 40, 5)*+{cat{A}}="A"; ( - 20, 12)*+{cat{C}_1}="C1"; (0, 15)*+{cat{C}_2}="C2"; (20, 12)*+{cat{C}_3}="C3"; (40, 5)*+{cat{B}}="B"; (0, 0)*+{cat{D}_1}="D1"; (0, 7)*+{Downarrow, alpha}; {ar^{F_1} "A";"C1"}; {ar^{F_2} "C1";"C2"}; {ar^{F_3} "C2";"C3"}; {ar^{F_4} "C3";"B"}; {ar_{G_1} "A";"D1"}; {ar_{G_2} "D1";"B"}; $ However, we can also draw $ alpha $ as a string diagram: $ xymatrix{ F_1 ar@/_/@{ - }[drr] & hspace{1em}F_2 ar@/_/@<1ex>@{ - }[dr]& & hspace{ - 1em}F_3 ar@/^/@< - 1ex>@{ - }[dl] & F_4 ar@/^/@{ - }[dll]  && *+<1pc>[o][F - ]{alpha}  & G_1 ar@/^/@{ - }[ur]& & G_2 ar@/_/@{ - }[ul] } $ There is nothing special about $ 4 $ and $ 2 $ ; we could replace them by any natural numbers $ m $ and $ n $ . If $ m = 0 $ then $ cat{A} = cat{B} $ and the domain of $ alpha $ is $ 1_cat{A} $ (keeping in mind the last paragraph of Remark $ X $ ). In that case, the disk labelled $ alpha $ has no strings coming into the top. Similarly, if $ n = 0 $ then there are no strings coming out of the bottom. Vertical composition of natural transformations corresponds to joining string diagrams together vertically, and horizontal composition corresponds to put - ting them side by side. The identity on a functor $ F $ is drawn as a simple string, $ xymatrix{ F ar@{ - }[d]  F} $ Now let us apply this notation to adjunctions. The unit and counit are drawn as $ {c} xymatrix@C - 2ex{ & *+<1pc>[o][F - ]{eta}  F ar@/^/@{ - }[ur]& & G ar@/_/@{ - }[ul] } qquad text{and} qquad {c} xymatrix@C - 2ex{ Gar@/_/@{ - }[dr]& & Far@/^/@{ - }[dl]  & *+<1pc>[o][F - ]{epsln} } $ The triangle identities now become the topologically plausible equations $ !{c} xymatrix@C - (iii)5ex@R - (i)8ex{ &&& Far@/^.8pc/@{ - }[ddl]  & *+<1pc>[o][F - ]{eta} ar@{ - }[dr]|*{G} &&  && *+<1pc>[o][F - ]{epsln} &  Far@/^.8pc/@{ - }[uur] &&&  } = {c} xymatrix@C - (iii)5ex@R - (i)8ex{ F ar@{ - }[dddd]     F } qquadtext{and}qquad {c} xymatrix@C - (iii)5ex@R - (i)8ex{ Gar@/_.8pc/@{ - }[ddr]&&&  && *+<1pc>[o][F - ]{eta} ar@{ - }[dl]|*{F} &  & *+<1pc>[o][F - ]{epsln} &&  &&& Gar@/_.8pc/@{ - }[uul]  } = {c} xymatrix@C - (iii)5ex@R - (i)8ex{ G ar@{ - }[dddd]     G } $ In both equations, the right - hand side is obtained from the left by simply pulling the string straight. exs Let $ oppairi{A}{B}{f}{g} $ be order - preserving maps between ordered sets. Prove directly that the following conditions are equivalent: [(b)] for all $ a in A $ and $ b in B $ , $ f(a) leq b iff a leq g(b); $ $ a leq g(f(a)) $ for all $ a in A $ and $ f(g(b)) leq b $ for all $ b in B $ . (Both conditions state that $ f ladj g $ ; see Example $ X $ .) [(b)] Let $ hadjnli{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ be an adjunction with unit $ eta $ and counit $ epsln $ . Write $ Fix(GF) $ for the full subcategory of $ cat{A} $ whose objects are those $ A in cat{A} $ such that $ eta_A $ is an isomorphism, and dually $ Fix(FG) sub cat{B} $ . Prove that the adjunction $ (F, G, eta, epsln) $ restricts to an equivalence $ (F', G', eta', epsln') $ between $ Fix(GF) $ and $ Fix(FG) $ . Part $ X $ shows that every adjunction restricts to an equivalence between full subcategories in a canonical way. Take some examples of adjunctions and work out what this equivalence is. [(b)] Show that for any adjunction, the right adjoint is full and faithful if and only if the counit is an isomorphism. An adjunction satisfying the equivalent conditions of part $ X $ is called a reflection. (Compare Example $ X $ .) Of the examples of adjunctions given in this chapter, which are reflections? [(b)] Let $ ffrom K to L $ be a map of sets, and denote by $ f^*from pset(L) to pset(K) $ the map sending a subset $ S $ of $ L $ to its inverse image $ f^{ - 1}S sub K $ . Then $ f^* $ is order - preserving with respect to the inclusion orderings on $ pset(K) $ and $ pset(L) $ , and so can be seen as a functor. Find left and right adjoints to $ f^* $ . Now let $ X $ and $ Y $ be sets, and write $ pfrom X times Y to X $ for first projection. Regard a subset $ S $ of $ X $ as a predicate $ S(x) $ in one variable $ x in X $ , and similarly a subset $ R $ of $ X times Y $ as a predicate $ R(x, y) $ in two variables. What, in terms of predicates, are the left and right adjoints to $ p^* $ ? For each of the adjunctions, interpret the unit and counit as logical implications. (Hint: the left adjoint to $ p^* $ is often written as $ exists_Y $ , and the right adjoint as $ forall_Y $ .) Given a functor $ F from cat{A} to cat{B} $ and a category $ cat{S} $ , there is a functor $ F^*from ftrcat{cat{B}}{cat{S}} to ftrcat{cat{A}}{cat{S}} $ defined on objects $ Y in ftrcat{cat{B}}{cat{S}} $ by $ F^*(Y) = Yof F $ and on maps $ alpha $ by $ F^*(alpha) = alpha F $ . Show that any adjunction $ hadjnli{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ and category $ cat{S} $ give rise to an adjunction $ hadjnli{ftrcat{cat{A}}{cat{S}}} {ftrcat{cat{B}}{cat{S}}} {G^*}{F^*}. $ (Hint: use Theorem $ X $ .) We now come to the third formulation of adjointness, which is the one you will probably see most often in everyday mathematics. Consider once more the adjunction $ adjn{Vect_k}{Set.}{F}{U} $ Let $ S $ be a set. The universal property of $ F(S) $ , the vector space whose basis is $ S $ , is most commonly stated like this: given a vector space $ V $ , any function $ ffrom S to V $ extends uniquely to a linear map $ bar{f}from F(S) to V $ . As remarked in Example $ X $ , forgetful functors are often forgotten: in this statement, ` $ ffrom S to V $ ' should strictly speaking be ` $ ffrom S to U(V) $ '. Also, the word `extends' refers implicitly to the embedding $ {cccc} eta_Sfrom &S &to &UF(S)  &s &mapsto &s. $ So in precise language, the statement reads: for any $ V in Vect_k $ and $ f in Set(S, U(V)) $ , there is a unique $ bar{f} in Vect_k(F(S), V) $ such that the diagram $ {c} xymatrix{ S ar[r]^ - {eta_S} ar[dr]_f &U(F(S)) ar[d]^{U(bar{f})}  & U(V) } $ commutes. (Compare Example $ X $ .) In this section, we show that this statement is equivalent to the statement that $ F $ is left adjoint to $ U $ with unit $ eta $ . To do this, we need a definition. Given categories and functors $ xymatrix{ &cat{B} ar[d]^Q  cat{A} ar[r]_P & cat{C}, } $ the demph{comma category} $ comma{P}{Q} $ (often written as $ (P mathbin{downarrow} Q) $ ) is the category defined as follows: objects are triples $ (A, h, B) $ with $ A in cat{A} $ , $ B in cat{B} $ , and $ hfrom P(A) to Q(B) $ in $ cat{C} $ ; maps $ (A, h, B) to (A', h', B') $ are pairs $ (ffrom A to A', , gfrom B to B') $ of maps such that the square $ xymatrix{ P(A) ar[r]^{P(f)} ar[d]_h & P(A') ar[d]^{h'}  Q(B) ar[r]_{Q(g)} & Q(B') } $ commutes. Given $ cat{A} $ , $ cat{B} $ , $ cat{C} $ , $ P $ and $ Q $ as above, there are canonical functors and a canonical natural transformation as shown: $ xymatrix{ comma{P}{Q} ar[r] ar[d] ar@{}[dr]| - {nent} & cat{B} ar[d]^Q  cat{A} ar[r]_P & cat{C} } $ In a suitable 2 - categorical sense, $ comma{P}{Q} $ is universal with this property. Let $ cat{A} $ be a category and $ A in cat{A} $ . The demph{slice category} of $ cat{A} $ over $ A $ , denoted by $ cat{A}/A $ , is the category whose objects are maps into $ A $ and whose maps are commutative triangles. More precisely, an object is a pair $ (X, h) $ with $ X in cat{A} $ and $ hfrom X to A $ in $ cat{A} $ , and a map $ (X, h) to (X', h') $ in $ cat{A}/A $ is a map $ ffrom X to X' $ in $ cat{A} $ making the triangle $ xymatrix{ X ar[rr]^f ar[rd]_h & &X' ar[ld]^{h'}  &A } $ commute. Slice categories are a special case of comma categories. Recall from Example $ X $ that functors $ One to cat{A} $ are just objects of $ cat{A} $ . Now, given an object $ A $ of $ cat{A} $ , consider the comma category $ comma{1_cat{A}}{A} $ , as in the diagram $ xymatrix{ &One ar[d]^A  cat{A} ar[r]_{1_cat{A}} & cat{A}. } $ An object of $ comma{1_cat{A}}{A} $ is in principle a triple $ (X, h, B) $ with $ X in cat{A} $ , $ B in One $ , and $ hfrom X to A $ in $ cat{A} $ ; but $ One $ has only one object, so it is essentially just a pair $ (X, h) $ . Hence the comma category $ comma{1_{cat{A}}}{A} $ has the same objects as the slice category $ cat{A}/A $ . One can check that it has the same maps too, so that $ cat{A}/A iso comma{1_{cat{A}}}{A} $ . Dually (reversing all the arrows), there is a demph{coslice category} $ A/cat{A} iso comma{A}{1_{cat{A}}} $ , whose objects are the maps out of $ A $ . Let $ Gfrom cat{B} to cat{A} $ be a functor and let $ A in cat{A} $ . We can form the comma category $ comma{A}{G} $ , as in the diagram $ xymatrix{ &cat{B} ar[d]^G  One ar[r]_ - A & cat{A}. } $ Its objects are pairs $ (B in cat{B}, , ffrom A to G(B)) $ . A map $ (B, f) to (B', f') $ in $ comma{A}{G} $ is a map $ qfrom B to B' $ in $ cat{B} $ making the triangle $ xymatrix{ A ar[r]^ - f ar[rd]_{f'} &G(B) ar[d]^{G(q)}  &G(B') } $ commute. Notice how this diagram resembles the diagram $ X $ in the vector space example. We will use comma categories $ comma{A}{G} $ to capture the kind of universal property discussed there. Speaking casually, we say that $ ffrom A to G(B) $ is an object of $ comma{A}{G} $ , when what we should really say is that the pair $ (B, f) $ is an object of $ comma{A}{G} $ . There is potential for confusion here, since there may be different objects $ B, B' $ of $ cat{B} $ with $ G(B) = G(B') $ . Nevertheless, we will often use this convention. We now make the connection between comma categories and adjunctions. Take an adjunction $ hadjnli{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ and an object $ A in cat{A} $ . Then the unit map $ eta_Afrom A to GF(A) $ is an initial object of $ comma{A}{G} $ . Let $ (B, , f from A to G(B)) $ be an object of $ comma{A}{G} $ . We have to show that there is exactly one map from $ (F(A), eta_A) $ to $ (B, f) $ . A map $ (F(A), eta_A) to (B, f) $ in $ comma{A}{G} $ is a map $ qfrom F(A) to B $ in $ cat{B} $ such that $ {c} xymatrix{ A ar[r]^ - {eta_A} ar[rd]_f &GF(A) ar[d]^{G(q)}  &G(B) } $ commutes. But $ G(q) of eta_A = bar{q} $ by Lemma $ X $ , so $ X $ commutes if and only if $ f = bar{q} $ , if and only if $ q = bar{f} $ . Hence $ bar{f} $ is the unique map $ (F(A), eta_A) to (B, f) $ in $ comma{A}{G} $ . We now meet our third and final formulation of adjointness. Take categories and functors $ oppairi{cat{A}}{cat{B}}{F}{G} $ . There is a one - to - one correspondence between: [(b)] adjunctions between $ F $ and $ G $ (with $ F $ on the left and $ G $ on the right); natural transformations $ etafrom 1_cat{A} to GF $ such that $ eta_Afrom A to GF(A) $ is initial in $ comma{A}{G} $ for every $ A in cat{A} $ . We have just shown that every adjunction between $ F $ and $ G $ gives rise to a natural transformation $ eta $ with the property stated in $ X $ . To prove the theorem, we have to show that every $ eta $ with the property in $ X $ is the unit of exactly one adjunction between $ F $ and $ G $ . By Theorem $ X $ , an adjunction between $ F $ and $ G $ amounts to a pair $ (eta, epsln) $ of natural transformations satisfying the triangle identities. So it is enough to prove that for every $ eta $ with the property in $ X $ , there exists a unique natural transformation $ epslnfrom FG to 1_cat{B} $ such that the pair $ (eta, epsln) $ satisfies the triangle identities. Let $ etafrom 1_cat{A} to GF $ be a natural transformation with the property in $ X $ . paragraph*{Uniqueness} Suppose that $ epsln, epsln'from FG to 1_cat{B} $ are natural transformations such that both $ (eta, epsln) $ and $ (eta, epsln') $ satisfy the triangle identities. One of the triangle identities states that for all $ B in cat{B} $ , the triangle $ {c} xymatrix@C+1ex{ G(B) ar[r]^ - {eta_{G(B)}} ar[rd]_1 & G(FG(B)) ar[d]^{G(epsln_B)}  &G(B) } $ commutes. Thus, $ epsln_B $ is a map $ Bigl( FG(B),  G(B) toby{eta_{G(B)}} G(FG(B)) Bigr) quad longto quad Bigl( B,  G(B) toby{1} G(B) Bigr) $ in $ comma{G(B)}{G} $ . The same is true of $ epsln'_B $ . But $ eta_{G(B)} $ is initial, so there is only one such map, so $ epsln_B = epsln'_B $ . This holds for all $ B $ , so $ epsln = epsln' $ . paragraph*{Existence} For $ B in cat{B} $ , define $ epsln_Bfrom FG(B) to B $ to be the unique map $ bigl(FG(B), eta_{G(B)}bigr) to bigl(B, 1_{G(B)}bigr) $ in $ comma{G(B)}{G} $ . (So by definition of $ epsln_B $ , triangle $ X $ commutes.) We show that $ (epsln_B)_{B in cat{B}} $ is a natural transformation $ FG to 1 $ such that $ eta $ and $ epsln $ satisfy the triangle identities. To prove naturality, take $ B toby{q} B' $ in $ cat{B} $ . We have commutative diagrams $ xymatrix@C+1ex{ G(B) ar[r]^ - {eta_{G(B)}} ar[rd]_1 ar[rdd]_{G(q)} & GFG(B) ar[d]^{G(epsln_B)}  &G(B) ar[d]^{G(q)}  &G(B') } qquadqquad xymatrix@C+1ex{ G(B) ar[r]^ - {eta_{G(B)}} ar[d]^{G(q)} ar@/^ - 5pc/[rdd]_{G(q)} & GFG(B) ar[d]^{GFG(q)}  G(B') ar[r]^ - {eta_{G(B')}} ar[rd]_1 & GFG(B') ar[d]^{G(epsln_{B'})}  & G(B'). } $ So $ q of epsln_B $ and $ epsln_{B'} of FG(q) $ are both maps $ eta_{G(B)} to G(q) $ in $ comma{G(B)}{G} $ , and since $ eta_{G(B)} $ is initial, they must be equal. This proves naturality of $ epsln $ with respect to $ q $ . Hence $ epsln $ is a natural transformation. We have already observed that one of the triangle identities, equation $ X $ , holds. The other states that for $ A in cat{A} $ , $ xymatrix@C+1ex{ F(A) ar[r]^ - {F(eta_A)} ar[rd]_{1_{F(A)}} & FGF(A) ar[d]^{epsln_{F(A)}}  & F(A) } $ commutes. To prove it, we repeat our previous technique: there are commutative diagrams $ xymatrix@R+.5em@C+1ex{ A ar[r]^ - {eta_A} ar[rdd]_{eta_A} & GF(A) ar[dd]^{G(1_{F(A)})}  &  &GF(A) } qquadqquad xymatrix@C+1ex{ A ar[r]^ - {eta_A} ar[d]^{eta_A} ar@/^ - (v)7pc/[rdd]_{eta_A} & GF(A) ar[d]^{GF(eta_A)}  GF(A) ar[r]^ - {eta_{GF(A)}} ar[rd]_1 & GFGF(A) ar[d]^{G(epsln_{F(A)})}  & GF(A), } $ so by initiality of $ eta_A $ , we have $ epsln_{F(A)} of F(eta_A) = 1_{F(A)} $ , as required. In Section $ X $ we will meet the adjoint functor theorems, which state conditions under which a functor is guaranteed to have a left adjoint. The following corollary is the starting point for their proofs. Let $ Gfrom cat{B} to cat{A} $ be a functor. Then $ G $ has a left adjoint if and only if for each $ A in cat{A} $ , the category $ comma{A}{G} $ has an initial object. Lemma $ X $ proves `only if'. To prove `if', let us choose for each $ A in cat{A} $ an initial object of $ comma{A}{G} $ and call it $ bigl(F(A), , eta_A from A to GF(A)bigr) $ . (Here $ F(A) $ and $ eta_A $ are just the names we choose to use.) For each map $ ffrom A to A' $ in $ cat{A} $ , let $ F(f)from F(A) to F(A') $ be the unique map such that $ xymatrix@R=2ex{ A ar[rr]^ - {eta_A} ar[rd]_ - f & & G(F(A)) ar[dd]^{G(F(f))}  & A' ar[rd]_ - {eta_{A'}} &  & &G(F(A')) } $ commutes (in other words, the unique map $ eta_A to eta_{A'} of f $ in $ comma{A}{G} $ ). It is easily checked that $ F $ is a functor $ cat{A} to cat{B} $ , and the diagram tells us that $ eta $ is a natural transformation $ 1 to GF $ . So by Theorem $ X $ , $ F $ is left adjoint to $ G $ . This corollary justifies the claim made at the beginning of the section: that given functors $ F $ and $ G $ , to have an adjunction $ F ladj G $ amounts to having maps $ eta_A from A to GF(A) $ with the universal property stated there. exs What can be said about adjunctions between groups (regarded as one - object categories)? State the dual of Corollary $ X $ . How would you prove your dual statement? Let $ (F, G, eta, epsln) $ be an equivalence of categories, as in Definition $ X $ . Prove that $ F $ is left adjoint to $ G $ (heeding the warning in Remark $ X $ ). Let $ hadjnri{cat{A}}{Set}{U}{F} $ be an adjunction. Suppose that for at least one $ A in cat{A} $ , the set $ U(A) $ has at least two elements. Prove that for each set $ S $ , the unit map $ eta_Sfrom S to UF(S) $ is injective. What does this mean in the case of the usual adjunction between $ Grp $ and $ Set $ ? Given sets $ A $ and $ B $ , a demph{partial function} from $ A $ to $ B $ is a pair $ (S, f) $ consisting of a subset $ S sub A $ and a function $ S to B $ . (Think of it as like a function from $ A $ to $ B $ , but undefined at certain elements of $ A $ .) Let $ fcat{Par} $ be the category of sets and partial functions. Show that $ fcat{Par} $ is equivalent to $ Set_* $ , the category of sets equipped with a distinguished element and functions preserving distinguished elements. Show also that $ Set_* $ can be described as a coslice category in a simple way.
