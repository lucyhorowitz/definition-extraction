Here we prove the general adjoint functor theorem, which for convenience is restated below. The left - to - right implication follows immediately from Theorem $ X $ ; it is the right - to - left implication that we have to prove. paragraph*{upshape Theorem $ X $ (General adjoint functor theorem)} {itshape Let $ cat{A} $ be a category, $ cat{B} $ a complete category, and $ Gfrom cat{B} to cat{A} $ a functor. Suppose that $ cat{B} $ is locally small and that for each $ A in cat{A} $ , the category $ comma{A}{G} $ has a weakly initial set. Then $ G text{ has a left adjoint} iff G text{ preserves limits}. $ } The heart of the proof is the case $ cat{A} = One $ , where GAFT asserts that a complete locally small category with a weakly initial set has an initial object. We prove this first. The proof of this special case is illuminated by considering the even more special case where $ cat{A} = One $ and the category $ cat{B} $ is a poset $ scat{B} $ . We saw in Example $ X $ that the initial object (least element) of a complete poset $ scat{B} $ can be constructed as the meet of all its elements. Otherwise put, it is the limit of the identity functor $ 1_scat{B}from scat{B} to scat{B} $ . One might try to extend this result to arbitrary categories $ cat{B} $ by proving that the limit of the identity functor $ 1_cat{B}from cat{B} to cat{B} $ is (if it exists) an initial object. This is indeed true (Exercise $ X $ below). However, it is unhelpful: for if $ cat{B} $ is large then the limit of $ 1_cat{B} $ is a large limit, but we are only given that $ cat{B} $ has small limits. We seem to be at an impasse~ - - but this is where the clever idea behind GAFT comes in. In order to construct the least element of a complete poset, it is not necessary to take the meet of all the elements. More economically, we could just take the meet of the elements of some weakly initial subset (Exercise $ X $ ). In general, for an arbitrary complete category, the limit of any weakly initial set is an initial object. We prove this now. Let $ cat{C} $ be a complete locally small category with a weakly initial set. Then $ cat{C} $ has an initial object. Let $ scat{S} $ be a weakly initial set in $ cat{C} $ . Regard $ scat{S} $ as a full subcategory of $ cat{C} $ ; then $ scat{S} $ is small, since $ cat{C} $ is locally small. We may therefore take a limit cone $ Bigl( 0 toby{p_S} S Bigr)_{S in scat{S}} $ of the inclusion $ scat{S} incl cat{C} $ . We prove that $ 0 $ is initial. Let $ C in cat{C} $ . We have to show that there is exactly one map $ 0 to C $ . Certainly there is at least one, since we may choose some $ S in scat{S} $ and map $ j from S to C $ , and we then have the composite $ j p_S from 0 to C $ . To prove uniqueness, let $ f, g from 0 to C $ . Form the equalizer $ xymatrix@1{ E ar[r]^i &0 ar@<.5ex>[r]^f ar@< - .5ex>[r]_g &C. } $ Since $ scat{S} $ is weakly initial, we may choose $ S in scat{S} $ and $ hfrom S to E $ . We then have maps $ xymatrix@1{ 0 ar[r]^{p_S} &S ar[r]^h &E ar[r]^i &0  } $ with the property that for all $ S' in scat{S} $ , $ p_{S'}(ihp_S) = (p_{S'}ih)p_S = p_{S'} = p_{S'} 1_0 $ (where the second equality follows from $ X $ being a cone). But $ X $ is a limit cone, so $ ihp_S = 1_0 $ by Exercise $ X $ . Hence $ f = fihp_S = gihp_S = g, $ as required. We have now proved GAFT in the special case $ cat{A} = One $ . The rest of the proof is comparatively routine. Let $ cat{A} $ and $ cat{B} $ be categories. Let $ G from cat{B} to cat{A} $ be a functor that preserves limits. Then the projection functor $ P_A from comma{A}{G} to cat{B} $ of $ X $ creates limits, for each $ A in cat{A} $ . In particular, if $ cat{B} $ is complete then so is each comma category $ comma{A}{G} $ . The first statement is Exercise $ X $ , and the second follows from Lemma $ X $ . We now prove GAFT. By Corollary $ X $ , it is enough to show that $ comma{A}{G} $ has an initial object for each $ A in cat{A} $ . Let $ A in cat{A} $ . By Lemma $ X $ , $ comma{A}{G} $ is complete, and by hypothesis, it has a weakly initial set. It is also locally small, since $ cat{B} $ is. Hence by Lemma $ X $ , it has an initial object, as required. exs In this exercise, we suspend the convention (made implicitly in Definition $ X $ ) that we only speak of the limit of a functor $ scat{I} to cat{C} $ when $ scat{I} $ is small. Let $ cat{B} $ be a category, possibly large. The aim is to prove that a limit of the identity functor on $ cat{B} $ is exactly an initial object of $ cat{B} $ . [(b)] Let $ 0 $ be an initial object of $ cat{B} $ . Show that the cone $ (0 to B)_{B in cat{B}} $ on the identity functor $ 1_cat{B} $ is a limit cone. Now let $ Bigl(L toby{p_B} BBigr)_{B in cat{B}} $ be a limit cone on $ 1_cat{B} $ . Prove that $ p_L $ is the identity on $ L $ , and deduce that $ L $ is initial. Here you will prove the special case of Lemma $ X $ in which the category concerned is a poset. Let $ C $ be a poset and $ S sub C $ . [(b)] What does it mean, in purely order - theoretic terms, for $ S $ to be a weakly initial set in $ C $ ? Prove directly that if $ S $ is weakly initial and the meet $ Meet_{s in S} s $ exists then $ Meet_{s in S} s $ is a least element of $ C $ . Let $ G from cat{B} to cat{A} $ be a limit - preserving functor, and let $ A in cat{A} $ . [(b)] Show that for any small category $ scat{I} $ , a diagram of shape $ scat{I} $ in $ comma{A}{G} $ amounts to a diagram $ E $ of shape $ scat{I} $ in $ cat{B} $ together with a cone on $ G of E $ with vertex $ A $ . Prove that the projection functor $ P_A from comma{A}{G} to cat{B} $ of $ X $ creates limits.
