Sets and functions are ubiquitous in mathematics. You might have the impression that they are most strongly connected with the pure end of the subject, but this is an illusion: think of probability density functions in statistics, data sets in experimental science, planetary motion in astronomy, or flow in fluid dynamics. Category theory is often used to shed light on common constructions and patterns in mathematics. If we hope to do this in an advanced context, we must begin by settling the basic notions of set and function. That is the purpose of the first section of this chapter. The definition of category mentions a `collection' of objects and `collections' of maps. We will see in the second section that some collections are too big to be sets, which leads to a distinction between `small' and `large' collections. This distinction will be needed later, most prominently for the adjoint functor theorems (Chapter $ X $ ). The final section takes a historical look at set theory. It also explains why the approach to sets taken in this chapter is more relevant to most of mathematics than the traditional approach is. None of this section is logically necessary for anything that follows, but it may provide useful perspective. I do not assume that you have encountered axiomatic set theory of any kind. If you have, it is probably best to put it out of your mind while reading this chapter, as the approach to set theory that we take is quite different from the approach that you are most likely to be familiar with. A brief comparison of the traditional and categorical approaches can be found at the very end of the chapter. We have made no definition of `set', nor of `function'. Nevertheless, guided by our intuition, we can list some properties that we expect the world of sets and functions to have. For instance, we can describe some of the sets that we think ought to exist, and some ways of building new sets from old. Intuitively, a set is a bag of points: $ includegraphics[height=5em]{set} $ (There may, of course, be infinitely many.) These points, or elements, are not related to one another in any way. They are not in any order, they do not come with any algebraic structure (for instance, there is no specified way of multiplying elements together), and there is no sense of what it means for one point to be close to another. In particular examples, we might have some extra structure in mind; for instance, we often equip the set of real numbers with an order, a field structure and a metric. But to view $ reals $ as a mere set is to ignore all that structure, to regard it as no more than a bunch of featureless points. Intuitively, a function $ A to B $ is an assignment of a point in bag $ B $ to each point in bag $ A $ : $ includegraphics[height=5em]{function} $ We can do one function after another: given functions $ includegraphics[height=5em]{composable} $ we obtain a composite function $ includegraphics[height=(iv)6em]{composed} $ This composition of functions is associative: $ h of (g of f) = (h of g) of f $ . There is also an identity function on every set. Hence: Sets and functions form a category, denoted by $ Set $ . This does not pin things down much: there are many categories, mostly quite unlike the category of sets. So, let us list some of the special features of the category of sets. paragraph*{The empty set} There is a set $ emptyset $ with no elements. Suppose that someone hands you a pair of sets, $ A $ and $ B $ , and tells you to specify a function from $ A $ to $ B $ . Then your task is to specify for each element of $ A $ an element of $ B $ . The larger $ A $ is, the longer the task; the smaller $ A $ is, the shorter the task. In particular, if $ A $ is empty then the task takes no time at all; we have nothing to do. So there is a function from $ emptyset $ to $ B $ specified by doing nothing. On the other hand, there cannot be two different ways to do nothing, so there is only one function from $ emptyset $ to $ B $ . Hence: $ emptyset $ is an initial object of hspace{.1em} $ Set $ . In case this argument seems unconvincing, here is an alternative. Suppose that we have a set $ A $ with disjoint subsets $ A_1 $ and $ A_2 $ such that $ A_1 cup A_2 = A $ . Then a function from $ A $ to $ B $ amounts to a function from $ A_1 $ to $ B $ together with a function from $ A_2 $ to $ B $ . So if all the sets are finite, we should have the rule (text{number of functions from $ A $ to $ B $ }) & = (text{number of functions from $ A_1 $ to $ B $ })  & quadtimes (text{number of functions from $ A_2 $ to $ B $ }). In particular, we could take $ A_1 = A $ and $ A_2 = emptyset $ . This would force the number of functions from $ emptyset $ to $ B $ to be $ 1 $ . So if we want this rule to hold (and surely we do!), we had better say that there is exactly one function from $ emptyset $ to $ B $ . What about functions into $ emptyset $ ? There is exactly one function $ emptyset to emptyset $ , namely, the identity. This is a special case of the initiality of $ emptyset $ . On the other hand, for a set $ A $ that is not empty, there are no functions $ A to emptyset $ , because there is nowhere for elements of $ A $ to go. paragraph*{The one - element set} There is a set $ 1 $ with exactly one element. For any set $ A $ , there is exactly one function from $ A $ to $ 1 $ , since every element of $ A $ must be mapped to the unique element of $ 1 $ . That is: $ 1 $ is a terminal object of hspace{.1em} $ Set $ . A function from $ 1 $ to a set $ B $ is just a choice of an element of $ B $ . In short, the functions $ 1 to B $ are the elements of $ B $ . Hence: The concept of element is a special case of the concept of function. paragraph*{Products} Any two sets $ A $ and $ B $ have a product, $ A times B $ . Its elements are the ordered pairs $ (a, b) $ with $ a in A $ and $ b in B $ . Ordered pairs are familiar from coordinate geometry. All that matters about them is that for $ a, a' in A $ and $ b, b' in B $ , $ (a, b) = (a', b') iff a = a' text{ and } b = b'. $ More generally, take any set $ I $ and any family $ (A_i)_{i in I} $ of sets. There is a product set $ prod_{i in I} A_i $ , whose elements are families $ (a_i)_{i in I} $ with $ a_i in A_i $ for each $ i $ . Just as for ordered pairs, $ (a_i)_{i in I} = (a'_i)_{i in I} iff a_i = a'_i text{ for all } i in I. $ paragraph*{Sums} Any two sets $ A $ and $ B $ have a sum $ A + B $ . Thinking of sets as bags of points, the sum of two sets is obtained by putting all the points into one big bag: $ {c} includegraphics[height=5em]{sumL} , + , {c} includegraphics[height=5em]{sumR}  =  {c} includegraphics[height=5em]{sumtot} $ If $ A $ and $ B $ are finite sets with $ m $ and $ n $ elements respectively, then $ A + B $ always has $ m + n $ elements. It makes no difference what the elements of $ A + B $ are called; as usual, we only care what $ A + B $ is up to isomorphism. There are inclusion functions $ A toby{i} A + B otby{j} B $ such that the union of the images of $ i $ and $ j $ is all of $ A + B $ and the intersection of the images is empty. Sum is sometimes called disjoint union and written as $ amalg $ . It is not to be confused with (ordinary) union $ cup $ . For a start, we can take the sum of any two sets $ A $ and $ B $ , whereas $ A cup B $ only really makes sense when $ A $ and $ B $ come as subsets of some larger set. (For to say what $ A cup B $ is, we need to know which elements of $ A $ are equal to which elements of $ B $ .) And even if $ A $ and $ B $ do come as subsets of some larger set, $ A + B $ and $ A cup B $ can be different. For example, take the subsets $ A = {1, 2, 3 } $ and $ B = {3, 4 } $ of $ nat $ . Then $ A cup B $ has $ 4 $ elements, but $ A + B $ has $ 3 + 2 = 5 $ elements. More generally, any family $ (A_i)_{i in I} $ of sets has a sum $ sum_{i in I} A_i $ . If $ I $ is finite and each $ A_i $ is finite, say with $ m_i $ elements, then $ sum_{i in I} A_i $ has $ sum_{i in I} m_i $ elements. paragraph*{Sets of functions} For any two sets $ A $ and $ B $ , we can form the set $ A^B $ of functions from $ B $ to $ A $ . This is a special case of the product construction: $ A^B $ is the product $ prod_{b in B} A $ of the constant family $ (A)_{b in B} $ . Indeed, an element of $ prod_{b in B} A $ is a family $ (a_b)_{b in B} $ consisting of one element $ a_b in A $ for each $ b in B $ ; in other words, it is a function $ B to A $ . paragraph*{Digression on arithmetic} We are using notation reminiscent of arithmetic: $ A times B $ , $ A + B $ , and $ A^B $ . There is good reason for this: if $ A $ is a finite set with $ m $ elements and $ B $ a finite set with $ n $ elements, then $ A times B $ has $ m times n $ elements, $ A + B $ has $ m + n $ elements, and $ A^B $ has $ m^n $ elements. Our notation $ 1 $ for a one - element set and the alternative notation $ 0 $ for the empty set $ emptyset $ also follow this pattern. All the usual laws of arithmetic have their counterparts for sets: A times (B + C) &iso (A times B) + (A times C),  A^{B + C} &iso A^B times A^C,  (A^B)^C &iso A^{B times C}, and so on, where $ iso $ is isomorphism in the category of sets. (For the last one, see Example $ X $ .) These isomorphisms hold for all sets, not just finite ones. paragraph*{The two - element set} Let $ 2 $ be the set $ 1 + 1 $ (a set with two elements!). For reasons that will soon become clear, I will write the elements of $ 2 $ as $ true $ and $ false $ . Let $ A $ be a set. Given a subset $ S $ of $ A $ , we obtain a function $ chi_Sfrom A to 2 $ (the demph{characteristic function} of $ S sub A $ ), where $ chi_S(a) = true &text{if }a in S,  false &text{if }a notin S $ ( $ a in A $ ). Conversely, given a function $ ffrom A to 2 $ , we obtain a subset $ f^{ - 1}{true } = { a in A such f(a) = true } $ of $ A $ . These two processes are mutually inverse; that is, $ chi_S $ is the unique function $ ffrom A to 2 $ such that $ f^{ - 1}{true } = S $ . Hence: Subsets of $ A $ correspond one - to - one with functions $ A to 2 $ . We already know that the functions from $ A $ to $ 2 $ form a set, $ 2^A $ . When we are thinking of $ 2^A $ as the set of all subsets of $ A $ , we call it the demph{power set} of $ A $ and write it as $ pset(A) $ . paragraph*{Equalizers} It would be nice if, given a set $ A $ , we could define a subset $ S $ of $ A $ by specifying a property that the elements of $ S $ are to satisfy: $ S = { a in A such text{some property of } a text{ holds} } . $ It is hard to give a general definition of `property'. There is, however, a special type of property that is easy to handle: equality of two functions. Precisely, given sets and functions $ parpair{A}{B}{f}{g} $ , there is a set $ { a in A such f(a) = g(a) } . $ This set is called the equalizer of $ f $ and $ g $ , since it is the part of $ A $ on which the two functions are equal. paragraph*{Quotients} You are probably familiar with quotient groups and quotient rings (sometimes called factor groups and factor rings) in algebra. Quotients also come up everywhere in topology, such as when we glue together opposite sides of a square to make a cylinder. But the most basic context for quotients is that of sets. Let $ A $ be a set and $ sim $ an equivalence relation on $ A $ . There is a set $ qer{A}{sim} $ , the quotient of $ A $ by $ sim $ , whose elements are the equivalence classes. For example, given a group $ G $ and a normal subgroup $ N $ , define an equivalence relation $ sim $ on $ G $ by $ g sim h iff gh^{ - 1} in N $ ; then $ qer{G}{sim} = G/N $ . There is also a canonical map $ pfrom A to qer{A}{sim}, $ sending an element of $ A $ to its equivalence class. It is surjective, and has the property that $ p(a) = p(a') iff a sim a' $ . In fact, it has a universal property: any function $ ffrom A to B $ such that $ forall a, a' in A, qquad a sim a' implies f(a) = f(a') $ factorizes uniquely through $ p $ , as in the diagram $ xymatrix{ A ar[r]^ - p ar[rd]_{f} &qer{A}{sim} ar@{.>}[d]^{bar{f}}  &B. } $ Thus, for any set $ B $ , the functions $ qer{A}{sim} to B $ correspond one - to - one with the functions $ ffrom A to B $ satisfying $ X $ . This fact is at the heart of the famous isomorphism theorems of algebra. subjectchange We have now listed the properties of sets and functions that will be most important for us. Here are two more. paragraph*{Natural numbers} A function with domain $ nat $ is usually called a sequence. A crucial property of $ nat $ is that sequences can be defined recursively: given a set $ X $ , an element $ a in X $ , and a function $ rfrom X to X $ , there is a unique sequence $ (x_n)_{n = 0}^infty $ of elements of $ X $ such that $ x_0 = a, qquad x_{n + 1} = r(x_n) text{ for all } n in nat. $ This property refers to two pieces of structure on $ nat $ : the element $ 0 $ , and the function $ sfrom nat to nat $ defined by $ s(n) = n + 1 $ . Reformulated in terms of functions, and writing $ x_n = x(n) $ , the property is this: for any set $ X $ , element $ a in X $ , and function $ rfrom X to X $ , there is a unique function $ xfrom nat to X $ such that $ x(0) = a $ and $ xof s = r of x $ . Exercise $ X $ asks you to show that this is a universal property of $ nat $ , $ 0 $ and $ s $ . paragraph*{Choice} Let $ ffrom A to B $ be a map in a category $ cat{A} $ . A section (or demph{right inverse}) of $ f $ is a map $ ifrom B to A $ in $ cat{A} $ such that $ f of i = 1_B $ . In the category of sets, any map with a section is certainly surjective. The converse statement is called the demph{axiom of choice}: Every surjection has a section. It is called `choice' because specifying a section of $ ffrom A to B $ amounts to choosing, for each $ b in B $ , an element of the nonempty set $ { a in A such f(a) = b } $ . subjectchange The properties listed above are not theorems, since we do not have rigorous definitions of set and function. What, then, is their status? Definitions in mathematics usually depend on previous definitions. A vector space is defined as an abelian group with a scalar multiplication. An abelian group is defined as a group with a certain property. A group is defined as a set with certain extra structure. A set is defined asldots well, what? We cannot keep going back indefinitely, otherwise we quite literally would not know what we were talking about. We have to start somewhere. In other words, there have to be some basic concepts not defined in terms of anything else. The concept of set is usually taken to be one of the basic ones, which is why you have probably never read a sentence beginning `Definition: A set isldots'. We will treat function as a basic concept, too. But now there seems to be a problem. If these basic concepts are not defined in terms of anything else, how are we to know what they really are? How are we going to reason in the watertight, logical way upon which mathematics depends? We cannot simply trust our intuitions, since your intuitive idea of set might be slightly different from mine, and if it came to a dispute about how sets behave, we would have no way of deciding who was right. The problem is solved as follows. Instead of defining a set to be a such - and - such and a function to be a such - and - such else, we list some properties that we assume sets and functions to have. In other words, we never attempt to say what sets and functions are; we just say what you can do with them. In his excellent book Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction, Timothy citeGow considers the question: `What is the black king in chess?' He swiftly points out that this question is rather peculiar. It is not important that the black king is a small piece of wood, painted a certain colour and carved into a certain shape. We could equally well use a scrap of paper with `BK' written on it. What matters is what the black king does: it can move in certain ways but not others, according to the rules of chess. Similarly, we might not be able to say directly what a set or function `is', but we agree that they are to satisfy all the properties on the list. So the list of properties acts as an agreement on how to use the words `set' and `function', just as the rules of chess act as an agreement on how to use the chess pieces. What we are doing is often referred to as foundations. In this metaphor, the foundation consists of the basic concepts (set and function), which are not built on anything else, but are assumed to satisfy a stated list of properties. On top of the foundations are built some basic definitions and theorems. On top of those are built further definitions and theorems, and so on, towering upwards. The properties above are stated informally, but they can be formalized using some categorical language. (See citeLR or citeRST.) In the formal version, we begin by saying that sets and functions form a category, $ Set $ . We then list some properties of this category. For example, the category is required to have an initial and a terminal object, and the properties described informally under the headings `Products' and `Equalizers' are made formal by the statement that $ Set $ `has limits' (a phrase defined in Chapter $ X $ ). While we were making the list, we were guided by our intuition about sets. But once it is made, our intuition plays no further official role: any disputes about the nature of sets are settled by consulting the list of properties. (A subtlety arises. Whatever list of properties one writes down, there might be some questions that cannot be settled. In other words, there might be multiple inequivalent categories satisfying all the properties listed. This gets us into the realm of advanced logic: G"odel incompleteness, the continuum hypothesis, and so on, all beyond the scope of this book.) Now let us look again at the section on the empty set. You might have felt that I was on shaky ground when trying to convince you that $ emptyset $ is initial. But the point is that I do not need to convince you that this is a true statement; I only need to convince you that it is a convenient assumption. Compare the rule for numbers that $ x^0 = 1 $ . One can reasonably argue that $ 0 $ copies of $ x $ multiplied together ought to be $ 1 $ , but really the best justification for this rule is convenience: it makes other rules such as $ x^{m + n} = x^m cdot x^n $ true without exception. Indeed, it does not even make sense to ask whether it is `true' that $ emptyset $ is initial until we have written down our assumptions about how sets and functions behave. For until then, what could `true' mean? There is no physical world of sets against which to test such statements. We can make whatever assumptions about sets we like, but some lead to more interesting mathematics than others. If, for instance, you want to assume that there are no functions from $ emptyset $ to any other set, you can, but the tower of mathematics built on that foundation will look different from what you are used to, and probably not in a good way. For example, the `number of functions' rule (page $ X $ ) will fail, and there will be further unpleasant surprises higher up the tower. exs The demph{diagonal functor} $ Deltafrom Set to Set times Set $ is defined by $ Delta(A) = (A, A) $ for all sets $ A $ . Exhibit left and right adjoints to $ Delta $ . In the paragraph headed `Natural numbers', it was observed that the set $ nat $ , together with the element $ 0 $ and the function $ sfrom nat to nat $ , has a certain property. This property can be understood as stating that the triple $ (nat, 0, s) $ is the initial object of a certain category $ cat{C} $ . Find $ cat{C} $ . We have now made some assumptions about the nature of sets. One consequence of those assumptions is that in many of the categories we have met, the collection of all objects is too large to form a set. In fact, even the collection of isomorphism classes of objects is often too large to form a set. In this section, I will explain what these statements mean, and prove them. This section is not of central importance. As this book proceeds, I will say as little as possible about the distinction between sets and collections too large to be sets. Nevertheless, the distinction begins to matter in parts of category theory lying just within the scope of this book (the adjoint functor theorems), as well as beyond. Given sets $ A $ and $ B $ , write $ crd{A} leq crd{B} $ (or $ crd{B} geq crd{A} $ ) if there exists an injection $ A to B $ . We give no meaning to the expression ` $ crd{A} $ ' or ` $ crd{B} $ ' in isolation. (It would perhaps be more logical to write $ A leq B $ rather than $ crd{A} leq crd{B} $ , but the notation is well - established.) In the case of finite sets, it just means that the number of elements of $ A $ is less than or equal to the number of elements of $ B $ . Since identity maps are injective, $ crd{A} leq crd{A} $ for all sets $ A $ , and since the composite of two injections is an injection, $ crd{A} leq crd{B} leq crd{C} implies crd{A} leq crd{C}. $ Also, if $ A iso B $ then $ crd{A} leq crd{B} leq crd{A} $ . Less obvious is the converse: [Cantor - - Bernstein] Let $ A $ and $ B $ be sets. If $ crd{A} leq crd{B} leq crd{A} $ then $ A iso B $ . Exercise $ X $ . These observations tell us that $ leq $ is a preorder (Example $ X $ ) on the collection of all sets. It is not a genuine order, since $ crd{A} leq crd{B} leq crd{A} $ only implies that $ A iso B $ , not $ A = B $ . We write $ crd{A} = crd{B} $ , and say that $ A $ and $ B $ have the same cardinality, if $ A iso B $ , or equivalently if $ crd{A} leq crd{B} leq crd{A} $ . As long as we do not confuse equality with isomorphism, the sign $ leq $ behaves as we might imagine. For example, write $ crd{A} < crd{B} $ if $ crd{A} leq crd{B} $ and $ crd{A} neq crd{B} $ . Then $ crd{A} leq crd{B} < crd{C} implies crd{A} < crd{C} $ for sets $ A $ , $ B $ and $ C $ . Indeed, we have already established that $ crd{A} leq crd{C} $ , and the strict inequality follows from Theorem $ X $ . Here is another fundamental result of set theory. [Cantor] Let $ A $ be a set. Then $ crd{A} < crd{pset(A)} $ . Recall that $ pset(A) $ is the power set of $ A $ . The lemma is easy for finite sets, since if $ A $ has $ n $ elements then $ pset(A) $ has $ 2^n $ elements, and $ n < 2^n $ . Exercise $ X $ . For every set $ A $ , there is a set $ B $ such that $ crd{A} < crd{B} $ . qed In other words, there is no biggest set. We now justify the claim made at the beginning of this section: that for many familiar categories, the collection of isomorphism classes of objects is too large to form a set. We begin by doing this for the category $ Set $ itself. As a clue to why the collection of isomorphism classes of sets might be too large to form a set, consider the following statement: the collection of isomorphism classes of finite sets is too large to form a finite set. This is because there is one isomorphism class of finite sets for each natural number, but there are infinitely many natural numbers. Let $ I $ be a set, and let $ (A_i)_{i in I} $ be a family of sets. Then there exists a set not isomorphic to any of the sets $ A_i $ . Put $ A = psetBiggl(sum_{i in I} A_iBiggr), $ the power set of the sum of the sets $ A_i $ . For each $ j in I $ , we have the inclusion function $ A_j to sum_{i in I} A_i $ , so by Theorem $ X $ , $ crd{A_j} leq biggl| sum_{i in I} A_i biggr| < crd{A}. $ Hence $ crd{A_j} < crd{A} $ by $ X $ , and in particular, $ A_j notiso A $ . We use the word class informally to mean any collection of mathematical objects. All sets are classes, but some classes (such as the class of all sets) are too big to be sets. A class will be called small if it is a set, and large otherwise. For example, Proposition $ X $ states that the class of isomorphism classes of sets is large. The crucial point is: Any individual set is small, but the class of sets is large. This is even true if we pretend that isomorphic sets are equal. Although the `definition' of class is not precise, it will do for our purposes. We make a naive distinction between small and large collections, and implicitly use some intuitively plausible principles (for example, that any subcollection of a small collection is small). A category $ cat{A} $ is small if the class or collection of all maps in $ cat{A} $ is small, and large otherwise. If $ cat{A} $ is small then the class of objects of $ cat{A} $ is small too, since objects correspond one - to - one with identity maps. A category $ cat{A} $ is locally small if for each $ A, B in cat{A} $ , the class $ cat{A}(A, B) $ is small. (So, small implies locally small.) Many authors take local smallness to be part of the definition of category. The class $ cat{A}(A, B) $ is often called the hom - set from $ A $ to $ B $ , although strictly speaking, we should only call it this when $ cat{A} $ is locally small. $ Set $ is locally small, because for any two sets $ A $ and $ B $ , the functions from $ A $ to $ B $ form a set. This was one of the properties of sets stated in Section $ X $ . index{topological space!category of topological spaces!locally small@is locally small} $ Vect_k $ , $ Grp $ , $ Ab $ , $ Ring $ and $ Tp $ are all locally small. For example, given rings $ A $ and $ B $ , a homomorphism from $ A $ to $ B $ is a function from $ A $ to $ B $ with certain properties, and the collection of all functions from $ A $ to $ B $ is small, so the collection of homomorphisms from $ A $ to $ B $ is certainly small. A category is small if and only if it is locally small and its class of objects is small. Again, it may help to consider a similar fact about finiteness: a category $ cat{A} $ is finite (that is, the class of all maps in $ cat{A} $ is finite) if and only if it is locally finite (that is, each class $ cat{A}(A, B) $ is finite) and its class of objects is finite. Consider the category $ cat{B} $ defined in the last paragraph of Example $ X $ . Its objects correspond to the natural numbers, which form a set, so the class of objects of $ cat{B} $ is small. Each hom - set $ cat{B}(lwr{m}, lwr{n}) $ is a set (indeed, a finite set), so $ cat{B} $ is locally small. Hence $ cat{B} $ is small. A category is essentially small if it is equivalent to some small category. For example, the category of finite sets is essentially small, since by Example $ X $ , it is equivalent to the small category $ cat{B} $ just mentioned. If two categories $ cat{A} $ and $ cat{B} $ are equivalent, the class of isomorphism classes of objects of $ cat{A} $ is in bijection with that of $ cat{B} $ . In a small category, the class of objects is small, so the class of isomorphism classes of objects is certainly small. Hence in an essentially small category, the class of isomorphism classes of objects is small. From this we deduce: $ Set $ is not essentially small. Proposition $ X $ states that the class of isomorphism classes of sets is large. The result follows. By adapting this argument, we can show that many of our standard examples of categories are not essentially small. The strategy is to prove that there are at least as many objects of our category as there are sets. For any field $ k $ , the category $ Vect_k $ of vector index{vector space!category of vector spaces!essentially small@is not essentially small} spaces over $ k $ is not essentially small. As in the proof of Proposition $ X $ , it is enough to prove that the class of isomorphism classes of vector spaces is large. In other words, it is enough to prove that for any set $ I $ and family $ (V_i)_{i in I} $ of vector spaces, there exists a vector space not isomorphic to any of the spaces $ V_i $ . To show this, write $ hadjnri{Vect_k}{Set}{U}{F} $ for the free and forgetful functors. As in the proof of Proposition $ X $ , the set $ S = pset Biggl( sum_{i in I} U(V_i) Biggr) $ has the property that $ crd{U(V_i)} < crd{S} $ for all $ i in I $ . The free vector space $ F(S) $ on $ S $ contains a copy of $ S $ as a basis, so $ crd{S} leq crd{UF(S)} $ . Hence $ crd{U(V_i)} < crd{UF(S)} $ for all $ i $ , and so $ F(S) notiso V_i $ for all $ i $ , as required. Similarly, none of the categories $ Grp $ , $ Ab $ , $ Ring $ and $ Tp $ index{topological space!category of topological spaces!essentially small@is not essentially small} is essentially small (Exercise $ X $ ). Recall that the category of all categories and functors is written as $ CAT $ . We denote by $ Cat $ the category of small categories and functors between them. Monoids are by definition sets equipped with certain structure, so the one - object categories that they correspond to are small. Let $ cat{M} $ be the full subcategory of $ Cat $ consisting of the one - object categories. Then there is an equivalence of categories $ Mon eqv cat{M} $ . This is proved by the argument in Example $ X $ , noting that because each object of $ cat{M} $ is a small one - object category, the collection of maps from the single object to itself really is a set. exs [(b)] Let $ A $ be a set. Let $ thetafrom pset(A) to pset(A) $ be a map that is order - preserving with respect to inclusion. A demph{fixed point} of $ theta $ is an element $ S in pset(A) $ such that $ theta(S) = S $ .

The set theory that we began to develop in Section $ X $ is rather different from what many mathematicians think of as set theory. Here I will explain what the socially dominant version of set theory is, why, despite its dominance, it is the object of widespread suspicion, and why the kind of set theory outlined here is a more accurate reflection of how mathematicians use sets in practice. paragraph*{Cantor's set theory} The creation of set theory is generally credited to the German mathematician Georg Cantor, in the late nineteenth century. Previously, sets had seldom been regarded as entities worthy of study in their own right; but Cantor, originally motivated by a problem in Fourier analysis, developed an extensive theory. Among many other things, he showed that there are different sizes of infinity, proving, for instance, that there is no bijection between $ nat $ and $ reals $ . Cantor's theory met all the resistance that typically greets a really new idea. His work was criticized as nonsensical, as meaningless, as far too abstract; then later, as all very well but of no use to the mainstream of mathematics. Kronecker, an important mathematician of the day, called him a charlatan and a corrupter of youth. But nowadays, the basics of Cantor's work are on nearly every undergraduate mathematics syllabus. Times change. In the modern style of mathematics, almost every definition, when unravelled sufficiently, depends on the notion of set. But pre - Cantor, this was not so. It is interesting to try to understand the outlook of mathematicians of the time, who had successfully developed sophisticated subjects such as complex analysis and Galois theory without depending on this notion that we now regard as fundamental. Before continuing with the history, we need to discuss another fundamental concept. paragraph*{Types} Suppose someone asks you `is $ sqrt{2} = pi $ ?' Your answer is, of course, `no'. Now suppose someone asks you `is $ sqrt{2} = log $ ?' You might frown and wonder if you had heard right, and perhaps your answer would again be `no'; but it would be a different kind of `no'. After all, $ sqrt{2} $ is a number, whereas $ log $ is a function, so it is inconceivable that they could be equal. A better answer would be `your question makes no sense'. This illustrates the idea of types. The square root of $ 2 $ is a real number, $ rationals $ is a field, $ S_3 $ is a group, $ log $ is a function from $ (0, infty) $ to $ reals $ , and $ frac{d}{dx} $ is an operation that takes as input one function from $ reals $ to $ reals $ and produces as output another such function. One says that the type of $ sqrt{2} $ is `real number', the type of $ rationals $ is `field', and so on. We all have an inbuilt sense of type, and it would not usually occur to us to ask whether two things of different type were equal. You may have met this idea before if you have programmed computers. Many programming languages require you to declare the type of a variable before you first use it. For example, you might declare that $ x $ is to be a variable of type `real number', $ n $ a variable of type `integer', $ M $ a variable of type ` $ 3 times 3 $ matrix of lists of binary digits', and so on. The distinction between different types of object has always been instinctively understood. At the beginning of the twentieth century, however, events took a strange turn. paragraph*{Membership - based set theory} Those who came after Cantor sought to compile a definitive list of assumptions to be made about sets: an axiomatization of set theory. The list they arrived at, in the early years of the twentieth century, is known as ZFC (Zermelo - - Fraenkel with Choice). It soon became the standard, and it is the only kind of axiomatic set theory that most present - day mathematicians know. The axiomatization of Zermelo et al. was in some ways similar to the one that we were working towards in the first section of this chapter. But there is at least one crucial difference: whereas we took sets and functions as our basic concepts, they took sets and membership. At first sight, this difference might seem mild. But when the membership - based approach is used as a foundation on which to build the rest of mathematics, several bizarre features become apparent: In the Zermelo approach, everything is a set. For instance, a function is defined as a set with certain properties. Many other things that you would not think of as being sets are, nevertheless, treated as sets: the number $ sqrt{2} $ is a set, the function $ log $ is a set, the operator $ frac{d}{dx} $ is a set, and so on. You might wonder how this is possible. Perhaps it is useful to compare data storage in a computer, where files of all different types (text, sound, images, and so on) are ultimately encoded as sequences of $ 0 $ s and $ 1 $ s. To give an example, in the membership - based set theory presented in most books, the number $ 4 $ is encoded as the set $ { emptyset, { emptyset } , { emptyset, { emptyset } } , { emptyset, { emptyset } , { emptyset, { emptyset } } } } . $ The virtue of this approach is its simplicity: everything is a set! But the price to be paid is very high: we lose the fundamental notion of type, precisely because everything is regarded as being of type `set'. In the Zermelo approach, the elements of sets are always sets too. This is in conflict with ordinary mathematics. For instance, in ordinary mathematics, $ reals $ is certainly a set, but real numbers themselves are not regarded as sets. (After all, what is an element of $ pi $ ?) In this approach, membership is a global relation, meaning that for any two sets $ A $ and $ B $ , it makes sense to ask whether $ A in B $ . Since this approach views everything as a set, it makes sense to ask such apparently nonsensical questions as `is $ rationals in sqrt{2} $ ?' Further still, the axioms of ZFC imply that we can form the intersection $ A cap B $ of any sets $ A $ and $ B $ . (Its elements are those sets $ C $ for which $ C in A $ and $ C in B $ .) This makes possible further nonsensical questions such as `does the cyclic group of order $ 10 $ have nonempty intersection with $ integers $ ?' The answers to these nonsensical questions depend on the fine detail of how mathematical objects (numbers, functions, groups, etc.) are encoded as sets. Even devotees of the membership - based approach agree that this encoding is a matter of convention, just like a word processor's encoding of a document as a string of $ 0 $ s and $ 1 $ s. So the answers to these questions are meaningless. paragraph*{Set theory today} It should now be apparent why many modern - day mathematicians are suspicious of set theory. However often they are told that it is `the foundation of mathematics', they feel that much of it is irrelevant to their concerns. To some extent, this is justified. But it is also a symptom of the historical dominance of membership - based set theory: most mathematicians do not realize that there is any other kind. This is a shame. Taking sets and functions (rather than sets and membership) as the basic concepts leads to a theory containing all of the meaningful results of Cantor and others, but with none of the aspects that seem so remote from the rest of mathematics. In particular, the function - based approach respects the fundamental notion of type. The function - based approach is, of course, categorical, and its advantages are related to more general points about how mathematics looks through categorical eyes. Objects are understood through their place in the ambient category. We get inside an object by probing it with maps to or from other objects. For example, an element of a set $ A $ is a map $ 1 to A $ , and a subset of $ A $ is a map $ A to 2 $ . Probing of this kind is the main theme of the next chapter. paragraph*{Footnote for those familiar with ZFC} People brought up on traditional axiomatic set theory often have the following concern when they come across categorical set theory for the first time. The objects and maps of a category form a collection of some kind, perhaps a set, so the notion of category appears to depend on some prior set - like notion. How, then, can sets be axiomatized categorically? Is that not circular? It is not, because sets can be axiomatized categorically without mentioning categories once. To see how, let us first recall the shape of the ZFC axiomatization of sets. Informally, it looks like this: there are some things called sets; there is a binary relation on sets, called membership ( $ in $ ); some axioms hold. A categorical axiomatization of sets looks, informally, like this: there are some things called sets; for each set $ A $ and set $ B $ , there are some things called functions from $ A $ to $ B $ ; to each function $ f $ from $ A $ to $ B $ and function $ g $ from $ B $ to $ C $ , there is assigned a function $ gof f $ from $ A $ to $ C $ ; some axioms hold. Making precise such phrases as `some things' requires delicacy, as will be familiar to anyone who has done a logic course. But the difficulties are no worse for categorical axiomatizations of sets than for membership - based axiomatizations such as ZFC. One popular choice of categorical axioms for set theory can be summarized informally as follows. {@{}r@{  }l}   (i) &Composition of functions is associative and has identities.  (ii) &There is a terminal set.  (iii) &There is a set with no elements.  (iv) &A function is determined by its effect on elements.  (v) &Given sets $ A $ and $ B $ , one can form their product $ A times B $ .  (vi) &Given sets $ A $ and $ B $ , one can form the set of functions from $ A $ to $ B $ .  (vii) &Given $ ffrom A to B $ and $ b in B $ , one can form the inverse image $ f^{ - 1}{b } $ .  (viii) &The subsets of a set $ A $ correspond to the functions from $ A $ to $ {0, 1 } $ .  (ix) &The natural numbers form a set.  (x) &Every surjection has a section.    This informal summary uses terms such as `element' and `inverse image', which can be defined in terms of the basic concepts of set, function and composition. For instance, an element of a set $ A $ is defined as a map from the terminal set to $ A $ . It is certainly convenient to express these axioms in terms of categories. For example, the first axiom says that sets and functions form a category, and all ten together can be expressed in categorical jargon as `sets and functions form a well - pointed topos with natural numbers object and choice'. But in order to state the axioms, it is not necessary to appeal to any general notion of category. They can be expressed directly in terms of sets and functions. For details, see citeLR or citeRST. exone Choose a mathematician at random. Ask them whether they can accurately state any axiomatization of sets (without looking it up). If not, ask them what operating principles they actually use when handling sets in their day - to - day work.
