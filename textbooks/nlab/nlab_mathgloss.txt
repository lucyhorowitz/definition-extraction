## Definition

For $k$ a [[field]] or a [[division ring]], a __vector space__ over $k$ 
(or a $k$-vector space) is a [[module]] over the [[ring]] $k$.  When the vector space is fixed, its elements are called _vectors_, the field $k$ is referred to as the base field of the ground field of the vector space, and the elements of $k$ are called _scalars_. 

Sometimes a vector space over $k$ is called a __$k$-linear space__.  (Compare '$k$-[[linear map]]'.) If $k$ is only a division ring then we
carefully distinguish the left $k$-vector spaces and right $k$-vector spaces.

The [[category]] of vector spaces is typically denoted [[Vect]], or 
$Vect_k$ if we wish to make the field $k$ (the *ground field*) explicit. So

$$
  Vect_k \coloneqq k Mod
  \,.
$$

This category has vector spaces over $k$ as objects, and $k$-linear maps between these as morphisms.

### Multisorted notion 

Alternatively, one sometimes defines "vector space" as a two-sorted notion; taking the field $k$ as one of the sorts and a module over $k$ as the other. More generally, the notion of "module" can also be considered as two-sorted, involving a ring and a module over that ring. 

This is occasionally convenient; for example, one may define the notion of [[topological vector space]] or topological module as an [[internalization]] in $Top$ of the multisorted notion. This procedure is entirely straightforward for topological modules, as the notion of module can be given by a two-sorted Lawvere theory $T$, whence a topological module (for instance) is just a product-preserving functor $T \to Top$. One may then define a topological vector space as a topological module whose underlying (discretized) ring sort is a field. 


## Properties

Every [[free object|free]] vector space admits a [[basis of a vector space|basis]]. 

The _[[basis theorem]]_, which is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]], states that every vector space is a free vector space.

# Subspaces
* table of contents

## Idea

Various more or less geometrical concepts are called [[spaces]], to name a few [[vector spaces]], [[topological spaces]], [[algebraic spaces]], ....  If such objects form a [[category]], it is natural to look for the [[subobjects]] and to call them _subspaces_.  However, often the natural subspaces in the field are the [[regular subobjects]]; conversely, it is also often the case that variants which are not subobjects in the categorical sense are allowed, such as an [[immersed submanifold]]. (These may have self-intersections, and then the immersion map is not monic, nor can this map be replaced by the inclusion of the image, since this image is usually not a manifold.)


## Definitions and examples

### Vector subspaces

These are very well behaved; as a [[vector space]] $X$ is simply a [[module]] over a [[field]], so a subspace of $X$ is simply a [[submodule]].  More generally, this is a special case of a [[subalgebra]].

Vector subspaces are precisely the [[subobjects]] in [[Vect]].


### Topological subspaces

Given a [[topological space]] $X$ (in the sense of [[Bourbaki]], that is: a set $X$ and a topology $\tau_X$) and a [[subset]] $Y$ of $X$, a topology $\tau_Y$ on a set $Y$ is said to be the topology **[[induced topology|induced]]** by the [[inclusion function|set inclusion]] $Y\subset X$ if $\tau_Y = \tau_X \cap_{pw} \{Y\} = \{ U \cap Y | U\in\tau_X \}$. The pair $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is then said to be a (topological) **subspace** of $(X,\tau_X)$.

If a [[continuous map]] $f:Z\to X$ is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its [[image]] $f(Z)$ in the induced topology on $f(Z)$, this *inclusion* map is sometimes called an [[embedding]]; $Z$ is thus isomorphic in [[Top]] to a subspace of $X$.

See at _[[topological subspace]]_.


### Topological vector subspaces

A 'subspace' of a [[topological vector space]] usually means simply a [[linear subspace]], that is a subspace of the underlying discrete vector space.

However, the subspaces that we really want in categories such as [[Ban]] are the *closed* linear subspaces.  (Essentially, this is because we want our subspaces to be [[complete space|complete]] whenever our objects are complete.)


### Sublocales

Given a [[locale]] $L$, which can also be thought of as a [[frame]], a [[sublocale]] of $L$ is given by a [[nucleus]] on the frame $L$.  Even if $L$ is [[topological locale|topological]], so that $L$ can be identified with a [[sober space|sober]] [[topological space]], still there are generally many more sublocales of $L$ than the topological ones.


### Submanifolds

... [[submanifold]] ...


## Subsites

For Grothendieck topologies, one instead of a subspace has a concept of a [[subsite]].

# Quotient spaces
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

A *quotient space* is a [[quotient object]] in some [[category]] of [[spaces]], such as [[Top]] (of [[topological spaces]]), or [[Loc]] (of [[locales]]), etc.

Often the construction is used for the quotient $X/A$ by a subspace $A \subset X$ (example \ref{QuotientBySubspace} below).

Beware that [[quotient objects]] in the [[category]] [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]] also traditionally called 'quotient space', but they are really just a special case of [[quotient modules]], very different from the other kinds of quotient space.  However in _[[topological vector spaces]]_ both concepts come together.

## Definitions

### In $Top$

+-- {: .num_defn #QuotientTopologicalSpace}
###### Definition
**(quotient topological space)**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ be a [[topological space]]  and let

$$
  R_\sim \subset X \times X
$$

be an [[equivalence relation]] on its underlying set. Then the _quotient topological space_  has

* as underlying set the [[quotient set]] $X/\sim$, hence the set of [[equivalence classes]],

and

* a subset $O \subset X/\sim$ is declared to be an [[open subset]] precisely if its [[preimage]] $\pi^{-1}(O)$ under the canonical [[projection map]]

  $$
    \pi \;\colon\; X \to X/\sim
  $$

  is open in $X$.

To see that this indeed does define a topology on $X/\sim$ it is sufficient to observe that taking pre-images commutes with taking unions and with taking intersections.


Often one considers this with input datum not the equivalence relation, but any [[surjection]]

$$
  \pi \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

of sets. Of course this identifies $Y = X/\sim$ with $(x_1 \sim x_2) \Leftrightarrow (\pi(x_1) = \pi(x_2)) $.
Hence the _quotient topology_ on the codomain set of a function out of any topological space has as open subsets
those whose pre-images are open.

Equivalently this is the _[[final topology]]_ or _[[strong topology]]_ induced on $Y$ by the function $X \to Y$, see at _[Top -- Universal constructions](Top#UniversalConstructions)_.

=--

For this construction the function $X \to Y$ need not even be surjective, and we could generalize to a [[sink]] instead of a single map; in such a case one generally says *[[final topology]]* or *[[strong topology]]*.  See also at _[[topological concrete category]]_. 




### In $Loc$

A quotient space in $Loc$ is given by a [[regular subobject]] in [[Frm]].

(More details needed.)

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example #CircleAsQuotientOfClosedIntervalIdentifyingEndpoints}
###### Example

The [[trigonometric function]]

$$
  (cos(-),sin(-))
    \;\colon\; 
  [0,2\pi]
    \longrightarrow
  S^1
   \subset 
  \mathbb{R}^2
$$

from the [[closed interval]] with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] to the unit [[circle]] equipped with the [[subspace topology]] of the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[plane]] 

descends to a [[homeomorphism]] on the quotient space $[0,2 \pi]/(0 \sim 2 \pi)$ by the equivalence relation which identifies the two endpoints of the open interval.

$$
  \array{
    [0,2\pi] &\overset{(cos(-),sin(-))}{\longrightarrow}& S^1
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    [0,2\pi]/\simeq
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[universal property]] of the quotient it follows that $[0,2\pi]/(0 \sim 2\pi) \to S^1$ is a [[continuous function]]. Moreover, it is a [[bijection]] on the underlying sets by the $2\pi$-periodicity of sine and coside. Hence it is sufficient to see that it is an [[open map]] (by [this prop.](homeomorphism#HomeoContinuousOpenBijection)).

Since the open subsets of $[0,2\pi]$ are unions of 

1. the [[open intervals]] $(a,b)$ with $0 \lt a \lt b \lt 2\pi$,

1. the [[half-open intervals]]  $[0,b)$ and $(a,2\pi]$ with $0 \lt a,b  \lt 2\pi$ 

and since the projection map $\pi \colon [0,2\pi] \to [0,2\pi]/(0 \sim 2\pi)$ is injective on $(0, 2\pi)$, the open subsets of $[0,2\pi]/(0 \sim 2\pi)$ are unions of

1. the [[open intervals]] $(a,b)$ with $0 \lt a \lt b \lt 2\pi$,

1. the glued [[half-open intervals]]  $(b,2\pi]/(0\sim 2\pi) \cup [0,a)/(0 \sim 2\pi)$ for $0 \lt a,b \lt 2\pi$.

By the $2\pi$-periodicity of $(cos(-),sin(-))$, the image of the latter under $(cos(-),sin(-))$ is the same as the image of $(b, 2\pi + a)$. Since the function $(cos(-),sin(-)) \colon \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ is clearly an open map, it follows that the images of these open subsets in $S^1$ are open.

+-- {: .num_example #QuotientBySubspace}
###### Example
**(quotient by a subspace)**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $A \subset X$ a [[inhabited set|non-empty]] [[subset]].
Consider the [[equivalence relation]] on $X$ which identifies all points in $A$ with each other. The resulting quotient space (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}) is often simply denoted $X/A$.

Notice that $X/A$ is canonically a [[pointed topological space]], with base point the [[equivalence class]] $A/A \subset X/A$ of $A$.

If $A = \emptyset$ is the [[empty space]], then one defines 

$$
  X/\emptyset \coloneqq X_+ \coloneqq X \sqcup \ast
$$ 

to be the [[disjoint union space]] of $X$ with the [[point space]]. This is no longer a quotient space, but both constructions are unified by the _[[pushout]]_ $i \colon A \to X$ along the map $A \to \ast$, equivalently the [[cokernel]] of the inclusion:

$$
  \array{
    A &\overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& X/A
  }
  \,.
$$

This kind of quotient space plays a central role in the discussion of [[long exact sequences in cohomology]], see at _[[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]_.

+-- {: .num_example #QuotientOfRealNumbersByTranslationByRationalNumbers}
###### Example

Consider the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ equipped with their [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]]. Consider on $\mathbb{R}$ the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies all real numbers that differ by a [[rational number]]:

$$
  (x_1 \sim_{\mathbb{Q}} x_2)
    \Leftrightarrow
  \left(
     x_2 - x_1 \in \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Q}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Then the quotient space $\mathbb{R}/\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is a [[codiscrete topological space]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


We need to check that the only open subsets of $X/\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$ are the empty set and the entire set $X/\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$. 

So let $U \subset \mathbb{R}/\sim$ be a non-empty subset. 

Write $\pi \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}/\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$ for the quotient projection. By definition $U$ is open precisely if its pre-image $\pi^{-1}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is open. By the Euclidean topology, this is the case precissely if $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is a union of [[open intervals]]. Since by assumption $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is non-empty, it contains at least one open interval $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$, with $a \lt b$. By the density of the rational numbers, there exists a rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ with

$$
  0 \lt q \lt b - a
  \,.
$$

By definition of $\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$ we have for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ that all elements in $(a + n q, b + n q) \subset \mathbb{R}$ are $\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$-equivalent to elements in $(a,b)$, hence that also $(a+q,b+q) \subset \pi^{-1}(U)$. But the union of these open intervals is all of $\mathbb{R}$

$$
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{Z}}{\cup} (q + n q, b + n q)
  \;=\;
  \mathbb{R}
$$

and so $\pi^{-1}(U) = \mathbb{R}$.

## Properties

1. Recall that a map $q \colon X \to Y$ is [[open map|open]] if $q(U)$ is open in $Y$ whenever $U$ is open in $X$. It is not the case that a quotient map $q \colon X \to Y$ is necessarily open. Indeed, the identification map $q \colon I \sqcup \{\ast\} \to S^1$, where the endpoints of $I$ are identified with $\ast$, takes the open point $\ast$ of the domain to a non-open point in $S^1$. 

1. Nor is it the case that a quotient map is necessarily a closed map; the classic example is the projection map $\pi_1 \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, which projects the closed locus $x y = 1$ onto a non-closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$. (This is a quotient map, by the next remark.) 

1. It is easy to prove that a continuous open surjection $p \colon X \to Y$ is a quotient map. For instance, projection maps $\pi \colon X \times Y \to Y$ are quotient maps, provided that $X$ is inhabited. Likewise, a continuous closed surjection $p: X \to Y$ is a quotient map: $p^{-1}(U)$ is open $\Rightarrow$ $p^{-1}(\neg U)$ is closed $\Rightarrow$ $p(p^{-1}(\neg U)) = \neg U$ is closed $\Rightarrow$ $U$ is open. For example, a continuous surjection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a quotient map. 


+-- {: .num_prop #DetectViaSaturatedSubsetsContinuousQuotientMap}
###### Proposition

A [[continuous function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y,\tau_Y)
$$

whose underlying function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is [[surjective function|surjective]]
exhibits $\tau_Y$ as the corresponding [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]]
precisely if $f$ sends open and $f$-[[saturated subsets]] in $X$ to open subsets of $Y$.
By [this lemma](saturated+subset#ComplementOfSaturatedSubsetIsSaturated)  this is the case precisely if it sends
closed and $f$-saturated subsets to closed subsets.

By the [[universal property]] of the quotient it follows that $[0,2\pi]/(0 \sim 2\pi) \to S^1$ is a [[continuous function]]. Moreover, it is a [[bijection]] on the underlying sets by the $2\pi$-periodicity of sine and coside. Hence it is sufficient to see that it is an [[open map]] (by [this prop.](homeomorphism#HomeoContinuousOpenBijection)).

Since the open subsets of $[0,2\pi]$ are unions of 

1. the [[open intervals]] $(a,b)$ with $0 \lt a \lt b \lt 2\pi$,

1. the [[half-open intervals]]  $[0,b)$ and $(a,2\pi]$ with $0 \lt a,b  \lt 2\pi$ 

and since the projection map $\pi \colon [0,2\pi] \to [0,2\pi]/(0 \sim 2\pi)$ is injective on $(0, 2\pi)$, the open subsets of $[0,2\pi]/(0 \sim 2\pi)$ are unions of

1. the glued [[half-open intervals]]  $(b,2\pi]/(0\sim 2\pi) \cup [0,a)/(0 \sim 2\pi)$ for $0 \lt a,b \lt 2\pi$.

By the $2\pi$-periodicity of $(cos(-),sin(-))$, the image of the latter under $(cos(-),sin(-))$ is the same as the image of $(b, 2\pi + a)$. Since the function $(cos(-),sin(-)) \colon \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ is clearly an open map, it follows that the images of these open subsets in $S^1$ are open.

We need to check that the only open subsets of $X/\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$ are the empty set and the entire set $X/\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$. 

So let $U \subset \mathbb{R}/\sim$ be a non-empty subset. 

Write $\pi \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}/\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$ for the quotient projection. By definition $U$ is open precisely if its pre-image $\pi^{-1}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is open. By the Euclidean topology, this is the case precissely if $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is a union of [[open intervals]]. Since by assumption $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is non-empty, it contains at least one open interval $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$, with $a \lt b$. By the density of the rational numbers, there exists a rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ with

$$
  0 \lt q \lt b - a

By definition of $\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$ we have for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ that all elements in $(a + n q, b + n q) \subset \mathbb{R}$ are $\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}$-equivalent to elements in $(a,b)$, hence that also $(a+q,b+q) \subset \pi^{-1}(U)$. But the union of these open intervals is all of $\mathbb{R}$

## Properties

1. Recall that a map $q \colon X \to Y$ is [[open map|open]] if $q(U)$ is open in $Y$ whenever $U$ is open in $X$. It is not the case that a quotient map $q \colon X \to Y$ is necessarily open. Indeed, the identification map $q \colon I \sqcup \{\ast\} \to S^1$, where the endpoints of $I$ are identified with $\ast$, takes the open point $\ast$ of the domain to a non-open point in $S^1$. 

1. Nor is it the case that a quotient map is necessarily a closed map; the classic example is the projection map $\pi_1 \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, which projects the closed locus $x y = 1$ onto a non-closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$. (This is a quotient map, by the next remark.) 

1. It is easy to prove that a continuous open surjection $p \colon X \to Y$ is a quotient map. For instance, projection maps $\pi \colon X \times Y \to Y$ are quotient maps, provided that $X$ is inhabited. Likewise, a continuous closed surjection $p: X \to Y$ is a quotient map: $p^{-1}(U)$ is open $\Rightarrow$ $p^{-1}(\neg U)$ is closed $\Rightarrow$ $p(p^{-1}(\neg U)) = \neg U$ is closed $\Rightarrow$ $U$ is open. For example, a continuous surjection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a quotient map.

###### Proposition

A [[continuous function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y,\tau_Y)
$$

whose underlying function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is [[surjective function|surjective]]
exhibits $\tau_Y$ as the corresponding [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]]
precisely if $f$ sends open and $f$-[[saturated subsets]] in $X$ to open subsets of $Y$.
By [this lemma](saturated+subset#ComplementOfSaturatedSubsetIsSaturated)  this is the case precisely if it sends
closed and $f$-saturated subsets to closed subsets.

# Disjoint unions
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

The _disjoint union_ is a [[coproduct]] in [[Set]], the category of [[sets]]. 

In a general [[category]] [[coproducts]] need not have the expected disjointness property of those in [[Set]]. If they do they are called _[[disjoint coproducts]]_. 


## Definition

Given any family $(A_i)_{i:I}$ of sets, the (external) __disjoint union__ $\biguplus_i A_i$ (also written $\sum_i A_i$, $\coprod_i A_i$, etc) of the family is the set of all (ordered) pairs $(i,a)$ with $i$ in the index set $I$ and $a$ in $A_i$.

As stated, the type of the second element of such a pair depends on the first element, which is natural in [[dependent type theory]] (see at _[[dependent sum type]]_) and no problem for [[material set theory]], but it may be ill formed in a [[structural set theory]] or in some forms of [[type theory]], especially those based on the [[internal language]] of [[topos theory]].  Alternatively, one may define $\biguplus_i A_i$ to be the set of those elements $x$ of the [[cartesian product]] $\prod_i \mathcal{P}A_i$ of the [[power sets]] such that there is exactly one index $j$ such that $x_j$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]] and that $x_j$ is a [[singleton]].  If you\'re trying to be [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] too, then you may need to simply adopt the existence of disjoint unions as an axiom (the __axiom of disjoint unions__) in your [[foundations]], stating the following facts about it.

There is a natural [[injection]] $A_j \to \biguplus_i A_i$ (mapping $a$ to $(j,a)$, or mapping $a$ to $(i \mapsto \{a \;|\; i = j\})$) for each index $j$.  Conversely, for each element $x$ of $\biguplus_i A_i$, there is a unique index $j$ and such that $x$ is in the [[image]] of the injection from $A_j$.  It is common to treat $A_j$ as a [[subset]] of $\biguplus_i A_i$; so if no confusion can result (in particular, when the notation for an element of $A_j$ always makes the ambient set clear), one often suppresses the index in the notation for an element of the disjoint union.


## Special cases

Given sets $A$ and $B$, the disjoint union of the binary family $(A,B)$ is written $A \uplus B$ (also $A + B$, $A \amalg B$, etc); its elements may be written (if care is needed) as $(0,a)$ and $(1,b)$, $(1,a)$ and $(2,b)$, $\iota{a}$ and $\kappa{b}$, and in many other styles.

Given sets $A_1$ through $A_n$, the disjoint union of the $n$-ary family $(A_1,\ldots,A_n)$ is written $\biguplus_{i=1}^n A_i$ (or similarly); its elements may be written (if care is needed) as $(i,a)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $a \in A_i$.

Given sets $A_1$, $A_2$, etc, the disjoint union of the countably infinitary family $(A_1,A_2,\ldots)$ is written $\biguplus_{i=1}^\infty A_i$ (or similarly); its elements may be written (if care is needed) as $(i,a)$ for $i$ a natural number and $a \in A_i$.

Given a set $A$, the disjoint union of the unary family $(A)$ may be identified with $A$ itself; that is, we identify $(i,a)$ for the unique index $i$ with $a$.

The disjoint union of the empty family $()$ is [[empty set|empty]]; it has no elements.


## Internal version

(This is internal in the sense of 'internal direct sum', not [[internalization]].  For that, just see [[coproduct]].)

If a family $(A_i)_{i: I}$ of [[subsets]] of a given set $X$ are all pairwise disjoint (that is, $A_i \cap A_j$ has an element only if $i = j$, for any indices $i$ and $j$), then the [[union]] $\bigcup_i A_i$ is [[natural isomorphism|naturally bijective]] with the (external) disjoint union defined above.  Conversely, given an external disjoint union $\biguplus_i A_i$, each $A_j$ may be identified with a subset of $\biguplus_i A_i$ (as explained above); these subsets are all pairwise disjoint, and their union is the entire disjoint union.

Accordingly, a union of pairwise disjoint subsets may be called an __internal disjoint union__.  (Compare the internal vs external notions of [[direct sum]].)

## Definition

### Discrete

A __$K$-linear map__ (also __$K$-linear function__, __$K$-[[linear operator]]__, or __$K$-linear transformation__) is a [[morphism]] in $K$-[[Vect]] (or $K$-[[Mod]]), that is a [[homomorphism]] of [[vector spaces]] (or [[modules]]).  Often one suppresses mention of the [[field]] (or [[commutative ring]] or [[rig]]) $K$.

In elementary terms, a __$K$-linear map__ between $K$-[[linear spaces]] $V$ and $W$ is a [[function]] $T\colon V \to W$ such that
$$ T(r x + y) = r T(x) + T(y) ,$$
for $x$ and $y$ elements of $V$ and $r$ an element of $K$.  (It is an easy exercise that this one identity is enough to ensure that $T$ preserves all [[linear combination]]s.)


### Topological

The [[morphisms]] between [[topological vector spaces]] are of course the [[continuous map|continuous]] linear maps.  Between [[Banach spaces]] (including of course [[Hilbert spaces]]), these are the same as the [[bounded map|bounded]] linear maps, so they\'re often called __[[bounded operators]]__ (with linearity tacitly assumed).

In this context, __[[linear operators]]__ are more general; they are (in general) only [[partial functions]].  However, we still require the [[domain]] of the partial function to be a linear [[subspace]], after which the definition above applies.  Because one typically restricts attention to [[complete spaces]], the [[densely-defined operator]]s (where the domain is a [[dense subspace]]) are the most general needed.  To specify that the domain of a linear operator $T\colon V \to W$ is all of $V$, one may use a non-'operator' term, such as __linear mapping__.

Notice that we do *not* require partially-defined linear operators to be continuous; see [[unbounded operator]].  However, we have the theorem that any densely-defined, continuous, linear map $T\colon V \to W$, with $W$ [[complete space|complete]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], extends uniquely to all of $V$.  Thus one typically assumes that a continuous (or bounded) linear operator $T$ is defined on all of $V$ while an arbitrary linear operator $T$ is defined only on a dense subspace of $V$.


## Terminology

In elementary mathematics (at least as taught in the United States, perhaps elsewhere?), the term 'linear function' is usually used more generally, for an [[affine map]] (but still between vector spaces); in this same context, the term 'linear transformation' is often used instead for specifically linear maps.  (Another difference at this level is that 'linear functions' are usually scalar-valued, while 'linear transformations' are usually vector-valued.)

In [[operator theory]], one sometimes distinguishes 'linear maps' (defined everywhere, but not necessarily continuous in general) from 'linear operators' (partially defined in general, but assumed to be defined everywhere if continuous between complete Hausdorff spaces).  There is also a tendency for 'operator' to be used only for (possibly partial) [[endomorphisms]], that is $T\colon V \to V$; then operators may be [[composition|composed]], giving rise to an [[operator algebra]].  If $V$ is a [[function space]], then an endomorphism of $V$ is an [[operator]] in the sense of [[higher-order logic]]; the more general meaning of 'linear operator' is abstracted from this.

Let $R$ be an associative ring with 1. As usual $GL_n(R)$ will denote the [[general linear group]] of $n\times n$ non-singular matrices over $R$.   There is an embedding of $GL_n(R)$ into $GL_{n+1}(R)$ sending  a matrix $M = (m_{i,j})$ to the matrix $M^\prime$ obtained from $M$ by adding an extra row and column of zeros except that $m^\prime_{n+1,n+1} = 1$.  This gives a nested sequence of groups

  $$GL_1(R)\subset GL_2(R)\subset \ldots \subset GL_n(R)\subset GL_{n+1}(R)\subset \ldots$$

and we write $GL(R)$ for the colimit (union in this case) of these. It will be called the _stable general linear group_ over $R$.

# Duality
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

Instances of "dualities" relating two different, maybe opposing, but to some extent equivalent concepts or phenomena are ubiquitous in [[mathematics]] (and in [[mathematical physics]], see at _[[dualities in physics]]_). The term "duality" is widespread and doesn't have a single crisp meaning, but a rough guiding intuition is of pairs of concepts that are mirror images of one another. 

## General notions 

In terms of general abstract concepts in [[logic]] and [[category theory]], instances of dualities might be (and have been) organized as follows. 

### Abstract/formal/axiomatic duality

Instances here include projective duality, duality in lattice theory, and duality in category theory. In each case, one has a [[theory]] whose [[signature]] admits a nontrivial [[involution]], in such a way that "dualizing" or applying the involution to any axiom of the theory (but otherwise preserving the logical structure of formulae) results in another theorem of the theory. For example, for the theory of projective planes, the involution swaps points and lines, meets and joins, etc., and for each theorem there is a dual theorem. Similarly, in [[category]] theory, the involution swaps the domain and codomain and order of composition, etc., and for any theorem of formal category theory, the corresponding dual statement is also a theorem (because the set of axioms of category theory are closed under taking formal duals). 

Such formal duality can also be expressed at the level of [[models]] of the theory $T$: for each model $M$ there is a "dual" or "opposite" model $M^{op}$ obtained by re-interpreting each formal sort/function/relation of the theory as the dual sort/function/relation. This further induces an involution $Mod(T) \to Mod(T)$ on the category of models. For example, in the case of category theory, this operation $C \mapsto C^{op}$, mapping a category $C$ to its [[opposite category]], gives an involution $(-)^{op}: Cat \to Cat$ on the category [[Cat]] of (small) categories, viewing $Cat$ here as a 1-category. In fact this is the only non-trivial automorphism of [[Cat]], see [here](%28infinity%2Cn%29Cat#automorphisms)). 

This involution $(-)^{op}: Cat \to Cat$ is also known as _abstract duality_. While the construction is a priori tautologous, any given [[opposite category]] often is equivalent to a [[category]] known by other means, which makes abstract duality interesting (particularly so in cases of concrete duality, which we discuss next). 

### Concrete dualities 

Instances here include linear duality, Stone duality, Pontryagin duality, and projective inversions with respect to a conic hypersurface. In each such case there is some [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] process of "homming into" a suitable structure $V$ called a [[dualizing object]], which in the classical cases of what we will call "perfect duality", induces an equivalence of categories $C^{op} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} D$ where typically $C$ is the category of models of one type of concrete structure, and the equivalence maps the formal categorical dual $C^{op}$ to a category of models $D$ consisting of "dual" concrete structures. 

In other cases one might not obtain an equivalence or perfect duality, but in any case a contravariant [[adjoint pair]] of functors $S: C \to D$, $T: D \to C$ between categories which can be termed a duality of sorts, in that concepts developed in $C$ are mapped to dual concepts in $D$ and vice-versa. Quoting ([Lawvere-Rosebrugh, chapter 7](#LawvereRosebrugh)):

> Not every statement will be taken into its formal dual by the process of dualizing with respect to $V$, and indeed a large part of the study of mathematics

>>space vs. quantity

> and of logic

>>theory vs. example

>may be considered as the detailed study of the extent to which formal duality and concrete duality into a favorite $V$ correspond or fail to correspond. (p. 122)

Some examples follow. 

* In linear duality, say for vector spaces over a field $k$, the dual of a space $W$ is $W^\ast = \hom(W, k)$, the hom of $k$-linear maps into $k$. This induces a contravariant functor $(-)^\ast: Vect_k \to Vect_k$ that is adjoint to itself, in that there is a double-dual embedding $\delta_W: W \to W^{\ast\ast}$ such that 
$$1_{W^\ast} = (W^\ast \stackrel{\delta_{W^\ast}}{\to} W^{\ast\ast\ast} \stackrel{(\delta_W)^\ast}{\to} W^\ast).$$ 
This becomes a perfect duality if we restrict to finite-dimensional vector spaces, i.e., the contravariant functor $(-)^\ast: Vect_{fd} \to Vect_{fd}$ is adjoint-equivalent to itself (i.e., the covariant functor $((-)^\ast)^{op}: Vect_{fd} \to Vect_{fd}^{op}$ is left adjoint to $(-)^\ast: Vect_{fd}^{op} \to Vect_{fd}$ and the adjunction is an [[adjoint equivalence]]). 

* More generally, given a (usually [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal closed category]] $\mathcal{C}$, any object $D$ induces an operation $[-,D] : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}^{op}$ obtained by forming the [[internal hom]] into $D$, sending each object to what may be termed its $D$-dual object. There is a corresponding double-dual embedding $\delta_C: C \to [ [C, D], D]$ obtained as the composite 
$$C \to [ [C, D], C \otimes [C, D]] \to [ [C, D], [C, D] \otimes C] \to [ [C, D], D]$$ 
where the first arrow uses the unit of an adjunction $(- \otimes B) \dashv [B, -]$ where $B = [C, D]$, the second uses a symmetry isomorphism $C \otimes B \cong B \otimes C$, and the third uses the counit of an adjunction $(- \otimes C) \dashv [C, -]$, aka an evaluation map. It may be shown that the contravariant functor $(-)^\ast \coloneqq [-, D]: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ is again dual to itself, exactly as in the case of linear duality above, where we have a triangular equation 
$$1_{C^\ast} = (\delta_C)^\ast \circ \delta_{C^\ast}$$ 
for an adjunction $[-, D]^{op} \dashv [-, D]$. Under certain circumstances, we have perfect duality, i.e., double dualization $[ [-, D], D]: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ is an equivalence; see [[dualizing object in a closed category]] and [[star-autonomous category]]. Particular special cases of this may obtain when $D = I$, the monoidal unit, or even more particularly when every object has a [[dual object]] in the sense of [[monoidal categories]]; see also [[compact closed category]]. On the other hand, there is also a mild generalization of this type of example where we deal with a [[biclosed monoidal category]]; here the double dualization will involve both the left and right internal hom. 

* More general still is a concrete duality induced by a [[dualizing object]]. In this case one is given a pair of categories together with underlying-set functors 
$$U: \mathcal{C} \to Set, \qquad V: \mathcal{D} \to Set$$ 
(and often when one says "concrete", one intends that these functors be faithful as well, so that $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}$ can be viewed as "sets with structure"; see [[stuff, structure, property]]). The concrete duality consists of a pair of objects $C \in \mathcal{C}, D \in \mathcal{D}$ together with an isomorphism $\omega: U C \cong V D$, such that the contravariant homs $\hom(-, C): C^{op} \to Set$ and $\hom(-, D): D^{op} \to Set$ lift to a contravariant adjunction between $C$ and $D$, in the sense described [here](/nlab/show/dualizing+object#ambi). Frequently in practice, such concrete dualities are "naturally represented" in the sense described [here](/nlab/show/dualizing+object#natural), involving certain lifts adapted from the theory of [[topological concrete categories]]. 

Again, in all of these examples, one can consider the further condition of "perfect duality" where the units and counits of the (lifted) adjunctions are isomorphisms.  

### Adjunctions 
 {#Adjunctions}

Perhaps the loosest general notion of "duality" is that of [[adjunction]], as in pairs of [[adjoint functors]] ([Lambek 81](#Lambek81)). Here one may omit any concretizations via functors to $Set$, or even for that matter any explicit mention of opposite categories, and just work at the level of abstract categories themselves. 

Nevertheless, many adjunctions come packaged in "dual pairs". A famous slogan from [[Categories for the Working Mathematician]] is that "all concepts are Kan extensions", and in that light the dual pairs are instances of the general dual pair "(right Kan extension, left Kan extension)" which are formal duals in the axiomatic sense described earlier. Via the many incarnations of [[universal constructions]] in [[category theory]], we have for example 

   * [[limit]] and [[colimit]]

   * [[end]] and [[coend]]

   * [[dependent sum]] and [[dependent product]]

   * [[existential quantification]] and [[universal quantification]]

When the adjoint functors are [[monads]] and hence [[modalities]], then adjointness between them has been argued to specifically express the concept of [[duality of opposites]].

Again, adjunctions and specifically [[dual adjunctions]] ("[[Galois connections]]") may be thought of as generalized dualities, more general than "perfect duality" which involves equivalences between categories ("Galois correspondences"). However, it should also be noted that any such adjunction (or [[dual adjunction]]) restricts to a _maximal (dual) equivalence_ between [[subcategories]], by considering objects where the appropriate units and counits are isomorphisms. This generalizes the manner by which any Galois connection induces a Galois correspondence (where in this special case, one need only take the images of the poset maps which constitute the connection).

$$ f : C \to Set$, $\hat f : D \to Set $$
to [[Set]], which are represented by objects $a \in C$, $\hat a \in D$ with the same underlying set $f(a) = \hat f(\hat a)$. Such objects are known as [[dualizing objects]].

## Idea

The concept of a _dual basis_ is a way of characterizing [[projective modules]], alternative to their characterization as [[direct sum|direct summands]] of [[free modules]]. The terminology derives from a similarity with a situation involving [[dual vector spaces]], see [below](#RelationToDualVectorSpaces).


## Details

Let $R$ be a [[ring]] or, more generally, an [[associative algebra]] over a unital [[commutative ring]] $k$. 

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], one of the standard characterizations of the [[projective modules]] $N$ (say left) over $R$ is that there is an [[epimorphism]] $F\to N$ from a [[free module]] over $R$  which is [[split epimorphism|split]] ("$N$ is a [[direct summand]] of a [[free module]]", [this prop.](projective%20module#ProjectiveIsPreciselyDirectSummandOfFreeModule)).

Equivalently, an $R$-module $M$ is projective iff it has a __dual basis__ $\{(x_i,x_i^*)\in M\times Hom_k(M,R)\}_{i\in I}$ in the following sense. There is a free $R$-module $F = \oplus_{i\in I} R$, an epimorphism of $R$-modules $F\to M$, $F=\oplus_i R \ni \sum_i r_i\mapsto \sum_i r_i x_i$ which is split, i.e. has a right inverse, where this inverse, by the universal property of the direct sum, must be of the form $x\mapsto \sum_i x_i^*(x)\in \oplus_i R$ where $x_i^*\in Hom_k(M,R)$. The right inverse condition translates to  $\forall x \in M : x=\sum_i x_i^*(x)x_i$. In particular for every $x\in M$ $x_i^*(x)\neq 0$ for only finitely many $i\in I$.

## Relation to dual vector spaces
 {#RelationToDualVectorSpaces}

This terminology is related to but a bit different than in the case of $k$-vector spaces (cf. at [[dual vector space]]). 
If $V$ has a vector space
basis $(x_j)_{j\in I}$ is a [[linear basis]] of $V$ then $x_i^*$ _defined by_ $x_i^*(x_j) = \delta_i^j$ is not necessarily a basis of $V^* = Hom_k(V,k)$; it is
if $V$ is [[finite dimensional vector space|finite dimensional]].  In the case of projective module $M$, 
$x_i$ do not form a basis in a free sense, 
but only a set of generators and with the property that there exist another set $x_i^*$ in $M^*$ 
such that they together form a "dual basis". (Still, one sometimes says
that $x_i^*$ form a basis dual to $x_i$.)

Given an [[ordered field]] $K$ and a [[vector space]] $V$ over $K$ of dimension $n$ (a [[natural number]]), an __orientation__ of $V$ is a choice of one of the two [[equivalence classes]] of [[ordered basis|ordered bases]] of $V$, where two bases are considered equivalent if the [[transformation matrix]] from one to the other has [[positive number|positive]] [[determinant]].
=--

In the case $n = 0$, the only ordered basis is the [[empty list]], but we still declare there to be two orientations by fiat, usually called positive and negative.  We can make the definition seamless by taking the elements of the equivalence class to be pairs consisting of an ordered basis and a nonzero [[sign]] (positive or negative), with $(B_1, s_1) \sim (B_2, s_2)$ iff $\sgn \det I^{B_1}_{B_2} = s_1/s_2$.  This is redundant except in dimension $0$, where now each equivalence class has a single element, $(*, +)$ for the positive orientation and $(*, -)$ for the negative orientation (where $*$ is the empty list).

In any case, this ensures that if $\omega$ is an orientation, then there is also an __opposite orientation__ $-\omega$.


A fancier way to say the same is
+-- {: .num_defn #bigwedge}
###### Definition

For $V$ a vector space of dimension $n$, an __orientation__ of $V$ is an equivalence class of nonzero elements of the [[line]] $\bigwedge^n V$, the $n$th [[alternating power]] of $V$, where two such elements are considered equivalent when either (hence each) is a positive multiple of the other.
=--

Note that by both definitions, an orientation of a [[line]] (with $n = 1$) is an equivalence class of nonzero elements.

Assuming that $K$ is the field of [[real numbers]] or something like it, we can generalize from vector spaces to vector bundles:

+-- {: .num_defn #bundle}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[manifold]] and $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $n$, an __orientation__ on $V$ is an [[equivalence class]] of [[trivialization|trivializations]] of the [[line bundle]] $\bigwedge^k V$ that is obtained by associating to each [[fiber]] of $V$ its $k$th [[alternating power]].
=--

Equivalently for a [[smooth manifold]] this is an equivalence class of an everywhere non-vanishing element of $\bigwedge^k_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(V)$, which may be considered the [[sign]] of the element.

+-- {: .num_defn #manifold}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[manifold]] of dimension $n$, an __orientation__ of $X$ is an orientation of the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ (or [[cotangent bundle]] $T^* X$).
=--

This is equivalently a choice of everywhere non-vanishing [[differential form]] on $X$ of degree $n$; the orientation may be considered the [[sign]] of the $n$-form (and the $n$-form\'s [[absolute value]] is a [[pseudoform|pseudo]]-$n$-form).

A vector space always has an orientation, but a manifold or bundle may not.  If an orientation exists, $V$ (or $X$) is called __orientable__.  If $X$ is [[connected space]] and $V$ (or $X$) is orientable, then there are exactly $2$ orientations; more generally, the entire bundle is orientable iff the restriction to each [[connected component]] is orientable, and then the number of orientations is $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of orientable components.  (Or we can always say that the number of orientations is $2^k 0^m$, where now $m$ is also the number of nonorientable components.


## Properties

### In terms of lifting through Whitehead tower 

An orientation on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ is equivalently a lift $\hat g$ of the classifying map $g : X \to \mathcal{B}O(n)$ of its [[tangent bundle]] through the fist step $S O(n) \to O(n)$ in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $X$:

$$
  \array{
    && \mathcal{B}S O(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathcal{B} O(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

From this perspective a choice of orientation is the first in a series of special structures on $X$ that continue with

* **orientation**

* [[spin structure]]

* [[string structure]], [[differential string structure]]

* [[fivebrane structure]], [[differential fivebrane structure]]


### In terms of orientation in generalized cohomology

For $R$ an [[E-∞ ring]] spectrum, there is a general notion of $R$-orientation of vector bundles. This is described at

* [[orientation in generalized cohomology]].

For $R = H(\mathbb{R})$ be the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]
for the [[discrete group|discrete]] [[abelian group]] $\mathbb{R}$
of [[real number]]s, orientation in $R$-cohomology is equivalent to the 
ordinary notion of orientation described above.

## Idea

The term 'rank' is used in many contexts to number levels within a hierarchy.


## Rank of a module

Let $A$ be a [[ring]] and $N$ a [[module]] over $A$. If $A$ is a [[field]], then $N$ is a [[vector space]] and we speak of the _[[dimension]]_ of $N$; in the general case, we may speak of the _rank_:

A collection of elements $(w_i)_{i \in I}$ of $N$ is called a [[basis]] of $N$ (over $A$) if for every $x \in N$ there is a unique collection $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ of elements of $A$ such that $a_i = 0$ for all but finitely many $i \in I$ and $x = \sum_{i \in I} a_i w_i$. 

If $N$ has a basis it is called a _[[nLab:free module]]_ (over $A$). For many examples of $A$ (the __invariant basis number rings__), the [[cardinality]] $# I$ only depends on $N$ and not on the choice of basis. It is called the **rank** of $N$ over $A$, notation: $rank_A(M)$. In any case, $N$ is called the __free module of rank $# I$__. If $N$ is a [[finitely generated]] free module then the rank is a [[finite number]].

All of the following are invariant basis rings (source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_basis_number)):

*  any nontrivial [[commutative ring]] $K$,
*  the [[group ring]] $K(G)$ for $K$ any [[field]] (or nontrival commutative ring?) and $G$ any [[group]],
*  any [[Noetherian ring]].

Besides the [[trivial ring]] (over which any module is free with any set as basis), an example of a ring without invariant basis number is the ring of $\aleph_0$-dimensional square [[matrix|matrices]] (over any ring) in which each column has only finitely many nonzero entries (which allows multiplication to be defined).  As a module over itself, this ring is free on any inhabited finite set, as may be shown by using the equation $\aleph_0 = n \aleph_0$ (applied to the columns).


## Rank of a sheaf of modules

Let $(X,\mathcal{O})$ be a [[locally ringed space]] and $\mathcal{E}$ a $\mathcal{O}$-module. Then its _rank_ at a point $x \in X$ is the vector space dimension of the [[fiber]] $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \mathcal{E}_x \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_x} k(x)$ over the [[residue field]] $k(x)$.

If $\mathcal{E}$ is of [[coherent sheaf|finite type]], then the rank at $x$ can equivalently be defined as the minimal number of elements needed to generate the stalk $\mathcal{E}_x$ as a $\mathcal{O}_x$-module (by [[Nakayama's lemma]]). In this case, the rank is a [[semicontinuous map|upper semicontinuous]] function $X \to \mathbb{N}$.

In the [[internal logic|internal language]] of the sheaf topos $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$, the rank of $\mathcal{E}$ can internally quite simply be defined as the minimal number of elements needed to generate $\mathcal{E}$ (taken as an element of the suitably completed natural numbers, i.e. the poset of inhabited upper sets). Under the correspondence of internal inhabited upper sets in $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ and upper semicontinuous functions $X \to \mathbb{N}$ (details at _[[one-sided real number]]_), this definition coincides with the usual one if $\mathcal{E}$ is of finite type; see [this MathOverflow question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/34412/the-upper-semi-continuous-rank-of-a-module-sheaf).

See also _[[rank of a coherent sheaf]]_.

## Rank of a vector bundle

As a simple special case of the above, a [[vector bundle]] is said to have _rank $n$_ if each [[fiber]] is a [[vector space]] of [[dimension]] $n$. 

## Hereditary rank of a pure set

Every [[pure set]] within the [[von Neumann hierarchy]] appears first at some level given by an [[ordinal number]]; this number is its __hereditary rank__.

We may define this rank explicitly (and [[recursion|recursively]]) as follows:

$$ rank S = \bigcup_{x \in S} (rank x)^+ ,$$

where $\bigcup$ is the [[supremum]] operation on ordinals (literally the [[union]] for [[von Neumann ordinals]]) and $(-)^+$ is the [[successor]] operation (which is $a \mapsto a \cup \{a\}$ for von Neumann ordinals).

## Rank of a functor

Recall that a [[cardinal number]] $\alpha$ is said to be _regular_ if $|\bigcup_{i\in I} X_i |$&lt;$\alpha$ whenever $|I|$&lt;$\alpha$ and $|X_i|$&lt;$\alpha$ for all $i\in I$.

A functor $F:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{B}$  _has rank_ $\alpha$ for some regular cardinal $\alpha$ if $F$ preserves $\alpha$-[[filtered colimit|filtered colimits]]. $F$ _has rank_ when it has rank $\alpha$ for some regular cardinal $\alpha$. A monad has rank ($\alpha$) when its underlying endofunctor does.

The properties of functors with rank are discussed in section 5.5 of Borceux ([1994](#Borceux2)).

## Idea

The determinant is the (essentially unique) universal alternating multilinear map.

## Definition

### Preliminaries on exterior algebra

Let [[Vect]]${}_k$ be the [[category]] of [[vector space|vector spaces]] over a [[field]] $k$, and assume for the moment that the [[characteristic]] $char(k) \neq 2$. For each $j \geq 0$, let 

$$sgn_j \colon S_j \to \hom(k, k)$$ 

be the 1-dimensional [[sign representation]] on the [[symmetric group]] $S_j$, taking each transposition $(i j)$ to $-1 \in k^\ast$. We may linearly extend the sign action of $S_j$, so that $sgn$ names a (right) $k S_j$-[[module]] with underlying [[vector space]] $k$. At the same time, $S_j$ acts on the $j^{th}$ [[tensor product]] of a vector space $V$ by permuting tensor factors, giving a left $k S_j$-module structure on $V^{\otimes j}$. We define the [[Schur functor]] 

$$\Lambda^j \colon Vect_k \to Vect_k$$ 

by the formula 

$$\Lambda^j(V) = sgn_j \otimes_{k S_j} V^{\otimes j}.$$ 

It is called the $j^{th}$ **alternating power** (of $V$). 

Another point of view on the alternating power is via [[superalgebra]]. For any [[cosmos]] $\mathbf{V}$ let $CMon(\mathbf{V})$ be the category of [[commutative monoid]] objects in $\mathbf{V}$. The forgetful functor $CMon(\mathbf{V}) \to \mathbf{V}$ has a [[left adjoint]] 

$$\exp(V) = \sum_{n \geq 0} V^{\otimes n}/S_n$$ 

whose values are naturally regarded as graded by degree $n$. 

This applies in particular to $\mathbf{V}$ the category of [[supervector spaces]]; if $V$ is a supervector space concentrated in odd degree, say with component $V_{odd}$, then each symmetry $\sigma: V \otimes V \to V \otimes V$ maps $v \otimes w \mapsto -w \otimes v$ for elements $v, w \in V_{odd}$. It follows that the graded component $\exp(V)_n$ is concentrated in $parity(n)$ degree, with component $\Lambda^n(V_{odd})$. 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
There is a canonical natural isomorphism $\Lambda^n(V \oplus W) \cong \sum_{j + k = n} \Lambda^j(V) \otimes \Lambda^k(W)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Again take $\mathbf{V}$ to be the category of supervector spaces. Since the left adjoint $\exp: \mathbf{V} \to CMon(\mathbf{V})$ preserves [[coproducts]] and since the tensor product $\otimes$ of $\mathbf{V}$ provides the coproduct for commutative monoid objects, we have a natural isomorphism 

$$\exp(V \oplus W) \cong \exp(V) \otimes \exp(W).$$ 

Examining the grade $n$ component $\exp(V \oplus W)_n$, this leads to an identification 

$$\exp(V \oplus W)_n = \sum_{j + k = n} \exp(V)_j \otimes \exp(W)_k.$$ 

and now the result follows by considering the case where $V, W$ are concentrated in odd degree. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary 
If $V$ is $n$-[[dimension|dimensional]], then $\Lambda^j(V)$ has dimension $\binom{n}{j}$. In particular, $\Lambda^n(V)$ is 1-dimensional. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
By induction on dimension. If $\dim(V) = 1$, we have that $\Lambda^0(V)$ and $\Lambda^1(V)$ are $1$-dimensional, and clearly $\Lambda^n(V) = 0$ for $n \geq 2$, at least when $char(k) \neq 2$. 

We then infer 

$$\array{
\Lambda^j(V \oplus k) & \cong & \sum_{p + q = j} \Lambda^p(V) \otimes \Lambda^q(k) \\ 
 & \cong & \Lambda^j(V) \oplus \Lambda^{j-1}(V)
}$$ 

where the dimensions satisfy the same recurrence relation as for [[binomial coefficients]]: $\binom{n+1}{j} = \binom{n}{j} + \binom{n}{j-1}$. 
=-- 

More concretely: if $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ is a basis for $V$, then expressions of the form $e_{n_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes e_{n_j}$ form a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] for $V^{\otimes j}$. Let $e_{n_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge e_{n_j}$ denote the [[image]] of this element under the [[quotient]] map $V^{\otimes j} \to \Lambda^j(V)$. We have 

$$e_{n_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge e_{n_i} \wedge e_{n_{i+1}} \wedge \ldots \wedge e_{n_j} = -e_{n_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge e_{n_{i+1}} \wedge e_{n_i} \wedge \ldots \wedge e_{n_j}$$ 

(consider the transposition in $S_j$ which swaps $i$ and $i+1$) and so we may take only such expressions on the left where $n_1 \lt \ldots \lt n_j$ as forming a spanning set for $\Lambda^j(V)$, and indeed these form a basis. The number of such expressions is $\binom{n}{j}$. 


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the case where $char(k) = 2$, the same development may be carried out by simply decreeing that $e_{n_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge e_{n_j} = 0$ whenever $n_i = n_{i'}$ for some pair of distinct indices $i$, $i'$. 

=--

Now let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional space, and let $f \colon V \to V$ be a [[linear map]]. By the corollary, the map 

$$\Lambda^n(f) \colon \Lambda^n(V) \to \Lambda^n(V),$$ 

being an [[endomorphism]] on a 1-dimensional space, is given by multiplying by a scalar $D(f) \in k$. It is manifestly [[functor|functorial]] since $\Lambda^n$ is, i.e., $D(f g) = D(f) D(g)$. The quantity $D(f)$ is called the **determinant** of $f$. 

### Determinant of a matrix 

We see then that if $V$ is of dimension $n$, 

$$\det \colon End(V) \to k$$ 

is a [[homomorphism]] of multiplicative [[monoids]]; by commutativity of multiplication in $k$, we infer that 

$$\det(U A U^{-1}) = \det(A)$$ 

for each [[inverse|invertible]] [[linear map]] $U \in GL(V)$. 

If we choose a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of $V$ so that we have an identification $GL(V) \cong Mat_n(k)$, then the determinant gives a [[function]]

$$\det \colon Mat_n(k) \to k$$ 

that takes products of $n \times n$ [[matrices]] to products in $k$. The determinant however is of course independent of choice of basis, since any two choices are related by a change-of-basis matrix $U$, where $A$ and its transform $U A U^{-1}$ have the same determinant. 

By following the definitions above, we can give an explicit formula: 

$$
  \det(A)  
    \;=\; 
  \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i = 1}^n a_{i \sigma(i)}
  \;
$$ 


This may equivalently be written using the [[Levi-Civita symbol]] $\epsilon$ and the [[Einstein summation convention]] as

\[
  \label{DeterminantInTermsOfLCSymbol}
  \det(A)  
    \;=\; 
    a_{1 j_1}
    a_{2 j_2}
    \cdots
    a_{n j_n}
    \,
    \epsilon^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_n}
\]

which in turn may be re-written more symmetrically as

\[
  \label{DeterminantInTermsOfLCSymbols}
  \det(A)  
    \;=\;
    \frac{1}{n!}
    \epsilon^{ i_1 i_2 \cdots i_n }
    \,
    a_{i_1 j_1}
    a_{i_2 j_2}
    \cdots
    a_{i_n j_n}
    \,
    \epsilon^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_n}
\]



## Properties

We work over [[fields]] of arbitrary [[characteristic]]. The determinant satisfies the following properties, which taken together uniquely characterize the determinant. Write a square [[matrix]] $A$ as a row of column [[vectors]] $(v_1, \ldots, v_n)$. 

1. $\det$ is separately linear in each column vector: 
$$\det(v_1, \ldots, a v + b w, \ldots, v_n) = a\det(v_1, \ldots, v, \ldots, v_n) + b\det(v_1, \ldots, w, \ldots, v_n)$$ 

1. $\det(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 0$ whenever $v_i = v_j$ for distinct $i, j$. 

1. $\det(I) = 1$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. 

Other properties may be worked out, starting from the explicit formula or otherwise: 

* If $A$ is a diagonal matrix, then $\det(A)$ is the product of its diagonal entries. 

* More generally, if $A$ is an upper (or lower) triangular matrix, then $\det(A)$ is the product of the diagonal entries. 

* If $E/k$ is a [[field extension]] and $f$ is a $k$-linear map $V \to V$, then $\det(f) = \det(E \otimes_k f)$. Using the preceding properties and the [[Jordan normal form]] of a matrix, this means that $\det(f)$ is the product of its [[eigenvalues]] (counted with multiplicity), as computed in the [[algebraic closure]] of $k$. 

* If $A^t$ is the transpose of $A$, then $\det(A^t) = \det(A)$. 

### Cramer's rule 

A simple observation which flows from these basic properties is 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition
**(Cramer's Rule)**

Let $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ be column vectors of dimension $n$, and suppose 
$$w = \sum_j a_j v_j.$$
Then for each $i$ we have 
$$a_j \det(v_1, \ldots, v_i, \ldots, v_n) = \det(v_1, \ldots, w, \ldots, v_n)$$ 
where $w$ occurs as the $i^{th}$ column vector on the right. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
This follows straightforwardly from properties 1 and 2 above. 
=-- 

For instance, given a square matrix $A$ such that $\det(A) \neq 0$, and writing $A = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$, this allows us to solve for a vector $a$ in an equation 

$$A \cdot a = w$$

and we easily conclude that $A$ is invertible if $\det(A) \neq 0$. 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This holds true even if we replace the field $k$ by an arbitrary commutative [[ring]] $R$, and we replace the condition $\det(A) \neq 0$ by the condition that $\det(A)$ is a unit. (The entire development given above goes through, _mutatis mutandis_.) 

=--

### Characteristic polynomial and Cayley-Hamilton theorem 

Given a linear endomorphism $f: M\to M$ of a finite rank free unital module over a commutative unital ring, one can consider the zeros of the [[characteristic polynomial]] $\det(t \cdot 1_V - f)$. The coefficients of the polynomial are the concern of the [[Cayley-Hamilton theorem]]. 

### Over the real numbers: volume and orientation

A useful intuition to have for determinants of [[real number|real]] matrices is that they measure _change of volume_. That is, an $n \times n$ matrix with real entries will map a standard unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to a parallelpiped in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (quashed to lie in a hyperplane if the matrix is singular), and the determinant is, up to sign, the volume of the parallelpiped. It is easy to convince oneself of this in the planar case by a simple dissection of a parallelogram, rearranging the dissected pieces in the style of Euclid to form a rectangle. In algebraic terms, the dissection and rearrangement amount to applying shearing or [[elementary column operations]] to the matrix which, by the properties discussed earlier, leave the determinant unchanged. These operations transform the matrix into a diagonal matrix whose determinant is the area of the corresponding rectangle. This procedure easily generalizes to $n$ dimensions. 

The sign itself is a matter of interest. An invertible transformation $f \colon V \to V$ is said to be **[[orientation]]-preserving** if $\det(f)$ is positive, and **orientation-reversing** if $\det(f)$ is negative. Orientations play an important role throughout geometry and algebraic topology, for example in the study of orientable manifolds (where the tangent bundle as $GL(n)$-bundle can be lifted to a $GL_+(n)$-bundle structure, $GL_+(n) \hookrightarrow GL(n)$ being the subgroup of matrices of positive determinant). See also [[KO-theory]]. 

Finally, we include one more property of determinants which pertains to matrices with real coefficients (which works slightly more generally for matrices with coefficients in a [[local field]]): 

### As a polynomial in traces of powers
 {#AsAPolynomialInTracesofPowers}

On the [[relation between determinant and trace]]:

If $A$ is an $n \times n$ [[matrix]], the determinant of its [[exponential]] equals the [[exponential]] of its [[trace]] 

$$
  \det(\exp(A)) = \exp(tr(A))
  \,.
$$

More generally, the determinant of $A$ is a [[polynomial]] in the [[traces]] of the [[powers]] of $A$:

For $2 \times 2$-matrices:

$$
  det(A)
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{2}\left( tr(A)^2 - tr(A^2) \right)
$$

For $3 \times 3$-matrices:

$$
  det(A)
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{6}
  \left(
    (tr(A))^3
    - 
    3 tr(A^2) tr(A)
    +
    tr(A^3)
  \right)
$$

For $4 \times 4$-matrices:

$$
  det(A)  
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{24}
  \left(
    (tr(A))^4
    -
    6 tr(A^2)(tr(A))^2
    +
    3 (tr(A^2))^2
    +
    8 tr(A^3) tr(A)
    -
    6 tr(A^4)
  \right)
$$

Generally for $n \times n$-matrices ([Kondratyuk-Krivoruchenko 92, appendix B](#KondratyukKrivoruchenko92)):

\[
  \label{DeterminantAsPolynomialInTracesOfPowers}
  det(A)
  \;=\;
  \underset{ 
     { k_1,\cdots, k_n \in \mathbb{N} }
     \atop
     { \underoverset{\ell = 1}{n}{\sum} \ell k_\ell = n }
  }{\sum}
  \underoverset{ l = 1 }{ n }{\prod} 
  \frac{ (-1)^{k_l + 1} }{ l^{k_l} k_l !  }
  \left(tr(A^l)\right)^{k_l}
\]

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof of (eq:DeterminantAsPolynomialInTracesOfPowers) 

It is enough to prove this for semisimple matrices $A$ (matrices that are [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]] upon passing to the [[algebraic closure]] of the ground field) because this [[subset]] of matrices is [[Zariski topology|Zariski]] [[dense subset|dense]] (using for example the nonvanishing of the [[discriminant]] of the [[characteristic polynomial]]) and the set of $A$ for which the equation holds is [[Zariski topology|Zariski]] [[closed subset|closed]]. 

Thus, without loss of generality we may suppose that $A$ is [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] with $n$ [[eigenvalues]] $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ along the diagonal, where the statement can be rewritten as follows. Letting $p_k = tr(A^k) = \lambda_1^k + \ldots + \lambda_n^k$, the following identity holds: 

\[
\prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i = \underset{ 
     { k_1,\cdots, k_n \in \mathbb{N} }
     \atop
     { \underoverset{\ell = 1}{n}{\sum} \ell k_\ell = n }
  }{\sum}
  \underoverset{ l = 1 }{ n }{\prod} 
  \frac{ (-1)^{k_l + 1} }{ l^{k_l} k_l !  }
  p_l^{k_l}
\]

This of course is just a [[polynomial]] identity, one closely related to various of the [[Newton identities]] that concern symmetric polynomials in indeterminates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$. Thus we again let $p_k = x_1^k + \ldots + x_n^k$, and define the [[elementary symmetric polynomials]] $\sigma_k = \sigma_k(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ via the generating function identity 

\[
\sum_{k \geq 0} \sigma_k t^k = \prod_{i=1}^n (1 + x_i t). 
\]

Then we compute 

\[\array{
\sum_{k \geq 0} \sigma_k t^k & = & \prod_{i=1}^n (1 + x_i t) \\
 & = & \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \log(1 + x_i t)\right) \\ 
 & = & \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k \geq 1} (-1)^{k+1} \frac{x_i^k}{k} t^k \right)\\ 
 & = & \exp\left( \sum_{k \geq 1} (-1)^{k+1} \frac{p_k}{k} t^k\right)
}\] 

and simply match coefficients of $t^n$ in the initial and final series expansions, where we easily compute 

\[
x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n = \sum_{n = k_1 + 2k_2 + \ldots + n k_n} \prod_{l=1}^n \frac1{(k_l)!} \left(\frac{p_l}{l}\right)^{k_l} (-1)^{k_l+1}
\] 

This completes the proof.

## Characteristic polynomial and Cayley-Hamilton theorem. 

See also _[[determinant]]_.

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma 

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], and let $A$ be an $n \times n$ [[matrix]] with entries in $R$. Then there exists an $n \times n$ matrix $\tilde{A}$ with entries in $R$ such that $A \tilde{A} = \tilde{A} A = \det(A) \cdot I_n$. 

=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
We may as well take $R$ to be the [[polynomial ring]] $\mathbb{Z}[a_{i j}]_{1 \leq i, j \leq n}$, since we are then free to interpret the indeterminates $a_{i j}$ however we like along a ring map $\mathbb{Z}[a_{i j}] \to R$. Let $A$ denote the corresponding generic matrix. 

Guided by Cramer's rule (see [[determinant]]), put 

$$\tilde{A}_{j i} = \det(a_1, \ldots, e_i, \ldots a_n),$$ 

the $a_i$ being columns of $A$ and $e_i$, the column vector with $1$ in the $i^{th}$ row and $0$'s elsewhere, appearing as the $j^{th}$ column. If we pretend $A$ is invertible, then we know $A \tilde{A} = \det(A) \cdot I_n = \tilde{A} A$ by [[Cramer's rule]]. We claim this holds for general $A$. 

Indeed, we can interpret this as a [[polynomial]] equation in $\mathbb{C}[a_{i j}]$ and check it there. As an equation between polynomial functions on the space of matrices $A \in Mat_n(\mathbb{C}) = Spec(\mathbb{C}[a_{i j}])$, it holds on the dense subset $GL_n(\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow Mat_n(\mathbb{C})$. Therefore, by continuity, it holds on all of $Mat_n(\mathbb{C})$. But a polynomial function equation with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}$ implies the corresponding polynomial identity, and the proof is complete.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem 
(**Cayley-Hamilton**) 
Let $V$ be a finitely generated free module over a commutative ring $R$, and let $f \colon V \to V$ be an $R$-module map. Let $p(t) \in R[t]$ be the **characteristic polynomial** $\det(t \cdot 1_V - f)$ of $f$, and let $\phi_f \colon R[t] \to Mod_R(V, V)$ be the unique $R$-algebra map sending $t$ to $f$. Then $p(f) \coloneqq \phi_f(p)$ is the zero map $0 \colon V \to V$. 

=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Via $\phi_f$, regard $V$ as an $R[t]$-module, and with regard to some $R$-basis $\{v_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ of $V$, represent $f$ by a matrix $A$. Now consider $t \cdot I_n - A$ as an $n \times n$ matrix $B(t)$ with entries in $R[t]$. By definition of the module structure, this matrix $B(t)$, seen as acting on $V^n$, annihilates the length $n$ column vector $c$ whose $i^{th}$ row entry is $v_i$. 

By the previous lemma, there is $\tilde{B}(t)$ such that $\tilde{B}(t) B(t)$ is $\det(t \cdot I_n - A)$ times the identity matrix. It follows that 

$$\det(t \cdot I_n - A) c = \tilde{B}(t) B(t) c = \tilde{B}(t) 0 = 0$$ 

i.e., $\det(t \cdot I_n - A) \cdot v_i = 0$ for each $i$. Since the $v_i$ form an $R$-basis, the $R[t]$-scalar $\det(t \cdot I_n - A)$ annihilates the $R[t]$-module $V$, as was to be shown. 
=-- 

The Cayley-Hamilton theorem easily generalizes to finitely generated $R$-modules (not necessarily free) as follows. Let $f \colon V \to V$ be a module endomorphism, and suppose $\pi \colon R^n \to V$ is an epimorphism. Since $R^n$ is projective, the map $f \circ \pi$ can be lifted through $\pi$ to a map $A \colon R^n \to R^n$. Let $P(t)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $A$. 

+-- {: .num_prop #lem}
###### Proposition 
$P(f) = 0$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Write $P(t) = \sum_i a_i t^i$. We already know $P(A) = 0$. From $f \circ \pi = \pi \circ A$, it follows that $f^i \circ \pi = \pi \circ A^i$ for any $i \geq 0$. Hence $P(f) \circ \pi = \pi \circ P(A) = 0$. Since $\pi$ is epic, $P(f) = 0$ follows. 
=-- 

We give an interesting and perhaps surprising consequence of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem below, after establishing a lemma close in spirit to [[Nakayama's lemma]]. 

+-- {: .num_lemma} 
###### Lemma 
Suppose $V$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, and $g \colon V \to V$ is a module map such that $g(V) \subseteq I V$ for some ideal $I$ of $R$. Then there is a polynomial $p(t) = t^n + a_1 t^{n-1} + \ldots + a_n$, with all $a_i \in I$, such that $p(g) = 0$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
For some finite $n \geq 0$, we have a surjective map $p: R^n \to V$. Tensoring $p$ with $I$, we obtain a surjective map $I^n \cong I \otimes_R R^n \stackrel{I \otimes_R p}{\twoheadrightarrow} I \otimes_R V \stackrel{mult}{\twoheadrightarrow} I V$, fitting in a commutative diagram 

$$\array{
 & & & & & & I^n & \hookrightarrow & R^n \\
 & & & & & & \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\
R^n & \stackrel{p}{\to} & V & \stackrel{g}{\to} & im(g) & \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} & I V & \hookrightarrow & V 
}$$

By projectivity of $R^n$, we can lift $i g p: R^n \to I V$ to a map $h: R^n \to I^n$ making the diagram commute. Let $A$ be the $R$-module map $R^n \stackrel{h}{\to} I^n \hookrightarrow R^n$, regarded as a matrix. Then the characteristic polynomial of $A$ satisfies the conclusion, by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and Proposition \ref{lem}. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop #surj}
###### Proposition 
Let $V$ be a finitely generated module over a commutative ring $R$, and let $f \colon V \to V$ be a surjective module map. Then $f$ is an isomorphism. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Regard $V$ as a finitely generated $R[t]$-module via $\phi_f \colon R[t] \to Mod_R(V, V)$. Since $f$ is assumed surjective, we have $I V = V$ for the ideal $I = (t)$ of $R[t]$. Now take $g = 1_V$ as in the preceding lemma, a module map over the ring $R' = R[t]$. By the lemma, we see that 
$g^n + a_1 g^{n-1} + \ldots + a_n = 0$ where $a_i \in (t)$, in other words the $R[t]$-scalar 

$$(1 + a_1 + \ldots + a_n)1_V = 0$$ 

as an operator on $V$. Write $a_i = b_i(t) t$ for polynomials $b_i(t) \in R[t]$. Now we may rewrite the previous displayed equation as 

$$1_V(v) = -(\sum_i b_i(t)) t \cdot v$$ 

for all $v \in V$, which translates into saying that $1_V = -\sum_i b_i(f) f$, i.e., that $-\sum_i b_i(f)$ is a retraction of $f$. Since $f$ is epic, we now see $f$ is an isomorphism.

## Definition

Given a [[linear map|linear]] [[endomorphism]], an _eigenvector_ of it is a [[vector]] which is taken by the linear map to a multiple of itself. This multiple is called the _[[eigenvalue]]_ of the eigenvector.

If the linear map acts as a [[differential operator]] on a space of functions, its eigenvectors are sometimes called **eigenfunctions**.

## Definition ##

Classically, a **group** is a [[monoid]] in which every element has an [[inverse]] (necessarily unique). When written with a view toward [[group objects]] (see Internalization below), one should rather say that a group is a monoid together with an inversion operation. 

An **[[abelian group]]** is a group in which moreover the order in which two elements are multiplied is irrelevant.

## Delooping ##

To some extent, a group "is" a [[groupoid]] with a single object, or more precisely a [[pointed object|pointed]] groupoid with a single object.

The [[delooping]] of a group $G$ is a [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{B} G$ with 

* $Obj(\mathbf{B}G) = \{\bullet\}$ 

* $Hom_{\mathbf{B}G}(\bullet, \bullet) = G$.

Since for $G, H$ two groups, [[functors]] $\mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}H$ are canonically in bijection with group homomorphisms $G \to H$, this gives rise to the following statement:

Let [[Grpd]] be the 1-[[category]] whose objects are [[groupoids]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[functors]] (discarding the [[natural transformations]]). Let [[Grp]] be the category of groups. Then the [[delooping]] functor

$$
  \mathbf{B} : Grp \to Grpd
$$

is a [[full and faithful functor]]. In terms of this functor we may regard groups as the full [[subcategory]] of groupoids on groupoids with a single object.

It is in this sense that a group really is a groupoid with a single object.

But notice that it is unnatural to think of [[Grpd]] as a 1-category. It is really a [[2-category]], namely the sub-2-category of [[Cat]] on groupoids.

And the category of groups is _not_ equivalent to the full sub-2-category of the 2-category of groupoids on one-object groupoids. 

The reason is that two functors:

$$
  \mathbf{B}f_1, \mathbf{B}f_2 : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}H
$$ 

coming from two group homomorphisms $f_1, f_2 : G \to H$ are related by a [[natural transformation]] $\eta_h : \mathbf{B}f_1 \to \mathbf{B}f_2$ with single component $\eta_h : \bullet \mapsto h \in Mor(\mathbf{B} H)$ for each element $h \in H$ such that the homomorphisms $f_1$ and $f_2$ differ by the [[inner automorphism]] $Ad_h : H \to H$

$$
  (\eta_h : \mathbf{B}f_1 \to \mathbf{B}f_2)
  \Leftrightarrow 
  (f_2 = Ad_h \circ f_1)
  \,.
$$

To fix this, look at the category of [[pointed object|pointed]] groupoids with [[pointed functor|pointed functors]] and pointed natural transformations.  Between group homomorphisms as above, only identity transformations are pointed, so $Grp$ becomes a full sub-$2$-category of $Grpd_*$ (one that happens to be a $1$-[[1-category|category]]).  (Details may be found in the appendix to [[Lectures on n-Categories and Cohomology]] and should probably be added to [[pointed functor]] and maybe also [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]].)


## Generalizations

### Internalization 

A **[[group object]]** [[internalization|internal to]] a [[category]] $C$ with finite [[product|products]] is an object $G$ together with maps $mult:G\times G\to G$, $id:1\to G$, and $inv:G\to G$ such that various diagrams expressing associativity, unitality, and inverses commute.

Equivalently, it is a functor $C^{op}\to Grp$ whose underlying functor $C^{op} \to Set$ is [[representable functor|representable]].

For example, a group object in [[Diff]] is a [[Lie group]].  A group object in [[Top]] is a [[topological group]].  A group object in [[Sch/S]] (the category or [[relative schemes]]) is an $S$-[[group scheme]].  And a group object in $CAlg^{op}$, where [[CAlg]] is the category of [[commutative algebras]], is a (commutative) [[Hopf algebra]].

A group object in [[Grp]] is the same thing as an abelian group (see [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]]), and a group object in [[Cat]] is the same thing as an [[internal category]] in [[Grp]], both being equivalent to the notion of [[crossed module]]. 

### In higher categorical and homotopical contexts

Internalizing the notion of _group_ in [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] and [[homotopy theory|homotopical]] contexts yields various generalized notions. For instance

* a [[2-group]] is a group object in [[Grpd]]

* an [[n-group]] is a group object internal to [[n-groupoid]]s

* an [[∞-group]] is a [[group object in an (∞,1)-category]].

* a [[loop space]] is a group object in [[Top]]

* generally there is a notion of [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category|group object in an (infinity,1)-category]].

And the notion of [[loop space object]] and [[delooping]] makes sense (at least) in any [[(infinity,1)-category]].

Notice that the relation between group objects and deloopable objects becomes more subtle as one generalizes this way. For instance not every [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category|group object in an (infinity,1)-category]] is [[delooping|deloopable]]. But every group object in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] is.


### Weakened axioms

Following the practice of [[centipede mathematics]], we can remove certain properties from the definition of group and see what we get:

* remove inverses to get [[monoids]], then remove the identity to get [[semigroups]];
* or remove associativity to get [[loop (algebra)|loops]], then remove the identity to get [[quasigroups]];
* or remove all of the above to get [[magma|magmas]];
* or instead allow (in a certain way) for the binary operation to be partial to get [[groupoids]], then remove inverses to get [[categories]], and then remove identities to get [[semicategory|semicategories]]
* etc.

# Direct products
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definition

In [[universal algebra]], a __direct product__ is simply a [[product]] in a [[concrete category]] that is [[created limit|created]] by the [[forgetful functor]].

Compare the [[direct sum]], a more complicated concept.


## Examples

Trivially, a [[cartesian product]] of [[sets]] is a direct product in [[Set]].

One of the requirements of a [[topological category]] is that any family of objects must have a direct product, although the term 'direct product' is not used in topology.

Many [[algebraic categories]], such as [[Grp]], [[Ab]], [[Ring]], etc, also have all direct products; this is where the term 'direct product' originated.

The category of ($Set$-valued) models of any [[Lawvere theory]] has all direct products; this includes the examples from algebra above.

## Idea

A _subgroup_ of a [[group]] $G$ is a "smaller" group $K$ sitting inside $G$.

## Definition

A _subgroup_ is a [[subobject]] in the [[category]] [[Grp]] of [[group]]s: a [[monomorphism]] of groups

$$
  K \hookrightarrow G
  \,.
$$

Here $K$ is _a subgroup of $G$_. 

## Special cases

* [[normal subgroup]]

* [[stabilizer subgroup]]

* [[maximal compact subgroup]]

* [[torsion subgroup]]

* [[Borel subgroup]]

* [[parabolic subgroup]]

* [[generalized Fitting subgroup]]

## Properties

### Of free groups

Every subgroup of a [[free group]] is itself free. This is the statement of the _[[Nielsen-Schreier theorem]]_.

### Of Lie groups

For $H \hookrightarrow G$ a sub-[[Lie group]] inclusion write $\mathbf{B}H  \to \mathbf{B}G$ for the induced map on [[delooping]] [[Lie groupoids]]. The [[homotopy fiber]] of this map (in [[Smooth∞Grpd]]) is the [[coset space]] $G/H$: there is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  G/H \to \mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G
  \,.
$$

Now let $H \hookrightarrow K \hookrightarrow G$ be a sequence of two subgroup inclusions. By the above this yields the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    K/H &\to& G/H &\to& G/K 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}H &\to& \mathbf{B}H &\to& \mathbf{B}K
    \\

### Normal subgroups

A [[subgroup]] $N$ of a [[group]] $G$ is **normal** if the [[conjugation action|conjugation]] $n\mapsto g^{-1}n g$ by any element $g\in G$ leaves $N$ [[invariant]], i.e. $g^{-1}N g \coloneqq \{g^{-1}n g\,|\,n\in N\} = N$.

A subgroup $N$ is normal iff the [[partition]] of the group into left *[[cosets]]* of the subgroup $N$, that is the sets $g N = \{ g n\,|\,n\in N\}$, is *stable* in the sense that the left coset $g_1 g_2 N$ of the product $g_1 g_2$ of any two elements $g_1,g_2\in G$ depends only on the coset $g_1 N$, $g_2 N$. Thus there is well defined product on the set of cosets making the set of left cosets $N\backslash G$ a group. By $g N = g N g^{-1}g = N g$ the set of left cosets and the set of right cosets of a normal subgroup coincide; thus the induced group structure on the right coset set $G/N$ is the same and called the [[quotient group]] (see [[quotient object]]). 

Thus normal subgroups may also be defined as [[kernels]] $f^{-1}(e)$ of group homomorphisms $G \to H$ ($e \in H$ is the identity), and this is largely the point of normal subgroups: they are equivalent to [[congruence relations]] in the category of groups. 


### Normal subobject in a semiabelian category

A normal subgroup is a [[normal subobject]] of a group in the [[Grp|category of groups]]: the more general notion of 'normal subobject' makes sense in [[semiabelian category|semiabelian categories]] and some other setups. If we consider a group as a special case of an $\Omega$-[[Omega-group|group]], then a normal subgroup corresponds to an [[ideal of an Omega-group|ideal]]. 

### Normal morphisms of $\infty$-groups
 {#NormalMorphismOfInfinityGroups}

The notion of normal subgroups generalizes from groups to [[∞-groups]].

We may take as the characteristic propery of normal subgroup inclusions $K \hookrightarrow G$ that the [[quotient]] $G/K$ inherits a group structure. This quotient may be identified with the [[homotopy fiber]] of the induced morphism of [[delooping]] [[groupoids]] $\mathbf{B}K \to \mathbf{B}G$ (see example \ref{CrossedModulesAreHomotopyNormalGroupMaps} below). The following definition takes this as the defining property of "normality" of morphisms.


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[homotopy dimension]] 0 (for instance a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]) and let $K,G$ be [[∞-group]] objects in $\mathbf{H}$.

A [[morphism]] $f : K \to G$ of [[∞-groups]] in $\mathbf{H}$ is **normal** if its [[delooping]] is the [[homotopy fiber]] of a morphism to a [[0-connected]] object, hence if it fits into a [[fiber sequence]] of the form

$$
  \mathbf{B}K \stackrel{\mathbf{B}f}{\to} \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}(G\sslash K)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Here the object on the right is any [[0-connected]] [[∞-groupoid]]. By the assumption of [[homotopy dimension]] 0 and by the discussion at [[looping and delooping]] this is necessarily the [[delooping]] of some [[∞-group]], to be denoted $G\sslash K$. By the discussion at [[fiber sequence]] it follows that $G\sslash K \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B}(G \sslash K)$ is the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\mathbf{B}f$, hence that we have a long fiber sequence

$$
 G\sslash K \to \mathbf{B}K \stackrel{\mathbf{B}f}{\to}\mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}(G\sslash K)
  \,.
$$

Therefore equivalently this says that $f : K \to G$ is normal precisely if $\mathbf{B}f : \mathbf{B}K \to \mathbf{B}G$ is a [[principal ∞-bundle]]. The above fiber sequence says that this principal $\infty$-bundle has typical [[fiber]] $G\sslash K$ and is classified by the [[cocycle]] $\mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}(G\sslash K)$.

=--


For the case $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]] -- hence for [[discrete ∞-groups]] -- and with [[∞Grpd]] [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]], this notion is discussed in ([Prezma](#Prezma)). The further special where $f$ is a morphism of [[discrete group|discrete 1-groups]], such that $G\sslash K$ is a [[2-group]] (example \ref{CrossedModulesAreHomotopyNormalGroupMaps} below) is discussed in ([Farjoun-Segev](#FarjounSegev)).


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Such a normal morphism equivalently exhibits an [[∞-group extension]] $G$ of $G \sslash K$ by $K$. See there for more details.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Every ordinary normal subgroup inclusion $K \hookrightarrow G$ is also a normal morphism of ∞-groups, but there are more morphisms of 1-groups that are normal as morphisms of $\infty$-groups. See example \ref{CrossedModulesAreHomotopyNormalGroupMaps} below.

=--

## Properties 

* The lattice of normal subgroups of a group $G$ is a [[modular lattice]], because the category of groups is a [[Mal'cev category]] and, as mentioned earlier, normal subgroups are tantamount to congruence relations. (N.B.: it need not be true that the lattice of subgroups is modular: take for example the lattice of subgroups of the [[dihedral group]] of order $8$, which contains a forbidden pentagon.) 

### Recognition of homotopy-normal maps
 {#Recognition}

A recognition principle for normality of morphisms of [[∞-groups]] is ([Prezma, theorem 6.2](#Prezma)).

## Examples

### Normal sub-1-groups

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Every [[subgroup]] of an [[abelian group]] is normal, trivially.  

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $G$ a group equipped with an [[action]] on another group $N$ by group [[automorphisms]] $\rho : G \to Aut(N)$, the canonical inclusion 

$$
  N \hookrightarrow G \ltimes N
$$

exhibits $N$ as a normal subgroup of the [[semidirect product group]] $G \ltimes N$.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #inverse} 
###### Proposition 
If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $H$ and $\phi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism, then the [[inverse image]] $\phi^{-1}(N)$ is normal in $G$ and $\phi$ induces a group homomorphism $G/f^{-1}(N) \to H/N$. 
=-- 

The proof is entirely straightforward and will be omitted. 

### Normal sub-2-groups

+-- {: .num_example #CrossedModulesAreHomotopyNormalGroupMaps}
###### Example

Let $f : K \to G$ be a morphism of [[discrete groups]] (not necessarily a [[monomorphism]]) regarded as a morphisms of [[0-truncated]] [[discrete ∞-groups]]. Then the [[homotopy fiber]] of its [[delooping]] is the [[action groupoid]] 

$$
  G\sslash K = 
  \left(
    G \times K
    \stackrel{\overset{(-)\cdot f(-)}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}
   {\to}}
    G
  \right)
  \,.
$$ 


(This follows for instance by computing the [[homotopy pullback]] via the [[factorization lemma]].)

Since $G\sslash K$ is a [[homotopy type|1-type]], this being an [[∞-group]] means that it is a [[2-group]], hence (see the discussion there) that $f : K \to G$ makes a [[crossed module]] of groups. 

So [normal morphisms](#NormalMorphismOfInfinityGroups) of [[0-truncated]] [[discrete ∞-groups]] are equivalently morphisms underlying [[crossed modules]] of [[discrete groups]].

=--

This observation apparently goes back to [[Whitehead]].

## Idea

A _quotient group_ is a [[quotient object]] in the [[category]] [[Grp]] of [[groups]]. 


## Definition

For $G$ a [[group]] and $H \hookrightarrow G$ a [[normal subgroup]], the [[quotient group]] $G/H$ is the set of [[cosets]], equipped with a group structure induced from $G$.


## Examples

* For $A \hookrightarrow B$ a morphism between [[abelian groups]] the quotient $B/A$ is equivalently the [[cokernel]] of the inclusion.

* The quotient groups of any group by itself is the [[trivial group]]: $G/G = 1$.

## Definition

An [[action]]

$$
  (-)\cdot(-) 
  \;\colon\;
  G \times X \to X
$$

of a [[group]] $G$ on a [[set]] $X$ is called _transitive_ if it has a single [[orbit]], i.e. for any two elements, $x, y \in X$, there exists $g\in G$ such that $y = g \cdot x$. 

This is equivalent to saying that the [[shear map]]

$$
  \array{
    G \times X
    &
    \overset
      { (pr_2, \cdot) }
      {\longrightarrow}&
    X \times X
    \\
    (g, x) 
    &
    \mapsto
    & 
    \big( x, g \cdot x \big)
    \,.
  }
$$

is in [[epimorphism]]. In this form the definition makes sense for [[action objects]] [[internalization|internal]] to any ambient [[category]] with [[finite products]].

Beware that often it is assumed that the underlying [[object]] $X$ of a transitive action is [[inhabited]] (but not always, see at *[[pseudo-torsor]]).



For $k\ge 0$, an action $G \times X \to X$ is said to be **$k$-transitive** if the componentwise-action $G \times X^{\underline{k}} \to X^{\underline{k}}$ is transitive, where $X^{\underline{k}}$ denotes the set of tuples of $k$ distinct points (i.e., [[injective functions]] from $\{1,\dots,k\}$ to $X$).  For instance, an action of $G$ on $X$ is 3-transitive if any pair of triples $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ and $(b_1,b_2,b_3)$ of points in $X$, where $a_i \ne a_j$ and $b_i \ne b_j$ for $i\ne j$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $(b_1,b_2,b_3) = (g a_1,g a_2,g a_3)$.

A transitive action that is also [[free action|free]] is called _[[regular action|regular]]_ action. See also at _[[torsor]]_.

## Properties

A set equipped with a transitive action of $G$ (and which is [[inhabited]]) is the same thing as a [[connected object]] in the category of [[G-sets]]. A $G$-set may be decomposed uniquely as a coproduct of transitive $G$-sets.

## Examples

* Any group $G$ acts transitively on itself by multiplication $\cdot : G \times G \to G$, which is called the (left) [[regular representation]] of $G$.

* The [[alternating group]] $A_n$ acts transitively on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ for $n \gt 2$, and in fact it acts $(n-2)$-transitively for all $n \ge 2$.

* The [[modular group]] $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ acts transitively on the [[rational number|rational]] [[projective line]] $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} \cup \{\infty\}$. The [[projective general linear group]] $PGL(2,\mathbb{C})$ acts 3-transitively on the [[Riemann sphere]] $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$.

* An action of $\mathbb{Z}$ (viewed as the [[free group]] on one generator) on a set $X$ corresponds to an arbitrary [[permutation]] $\pi : X \to X$, but the action is transitive just in case $\pi$ is a _cyclic_ permutation.

## As an action on cosets

Let $* : G \times X \to X$ be a transitive action and suppose that $X$ is [[inhabited]].  Then $*$ is equivalent to the action of $G$ by multiplication on a [[coset]] space $G/H$, where the subgroup $H$ is taken as the [[stabilizer subgroup]]
$$H = G_x = \{ g \in G \mid g * x = x \}$$
of some arbitrary element $x \in X$.  In particular, the transitivity of $*$ guarantees that the $G$-equivariant map $G/H \to X$ defined by $g H \mapsto g * x$ is a bijection.  (Note that although the subgroup $H = G_x$ depends on the choice of $x$, it is determined up to conjugacy, and so the coset space $G/H$ is independent of the choice of element.)

### Discrete case

Given an [[action]] $G\times X\to X$ of a ([[discrete group|discrete]]) [[group]] $G$ on a set $X$, any [[set]] of the form $G x = \{g x|g\in G\}$ for a fixed $x\in X$ is called an __orbit__ of the action, or the __$G$-orbit through the point $x$__.  The set $X$ is a [[disjoint union]] of its orbits.


### Category of orbits

The _category of orbits_ of a [[group]] $G$ is the full subcategory
of the category of sets with an action of $G$.

Since any orbit of $G$ is isomorphic to the orbit $G/H$
for some group $H$, the category of $G$-orbits admits the following
alternative description: its objects are subgroups $H$ of $G$
and morphisms $H_1\to H_2$ are elements $[g]\in G/H_2$
such that $H_1\subset g H_2g^{-1}$.

In particular, the group of automorphisms of a $G$-orbit $G/H$
is $N_G(H)/H$, where $N_G(H)$ is the [[normalizer]] of $H$ in $G$.


### Topological case

If $G$ is a [[topological group]], $X$ a [[topological space]] and the action [[continuous map|continuous]], then one can distinguish [[closed subset|closed]] orbits from those which are not. Even when one starts with $G,X$ [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], the space of orbits is typically non-Hausdorff. 
(This problem is one of the motivations of the [[noncommutative geometry]] of Connes' school.)

If the original space is [[paracompact space|paracompact]] Hausdorff, then every orbit $G x$ as a topological $G$-space is isomorphic to $G/H$, where $H$ is the [[stabilizer subgroup]] of $x$. 


## Examples

* An orbit of a [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] of a [[permutation group]] is called a *[[permutation cycle]]*.

## Definition

For $G$ a [[group]] and $H_1, H_2 \hookrightarrow$ two [[subgroups]], one says that they are _conjugate subgroups_ if there [[existential quantifier|exists]] an [[element]] $g \in G$ such that the [[conjugation action]] by $g$ takes $H_1 \to H_1$:

$$
  H_1 \sim_{conj} H_2
  \;\;\;
  \coloneqq
  \;\;\;
  H_2 = Ad_g(H_1) = g H_1 g^{-1}
  \,.
$$

The [[equivalence classes]] under this [[relation]] are hence called the _[[conjugacy classes]] of subgroups_ of $G$. These play a key role in much of [[group theory]] and [[representation theory]], for instance as parameters for [[group characters]].

# Cyclic groups
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definition

A __cyclic group__ is a [[quotient group]] of the [[free group]] on the [[singleton]].

Generally, we consider a cyclic group as a [[group]], that is without specifying which element comprises the generating singleton.  But see [Ring structure](#Ring) below.


## Examples

There is (up to [[isomorphism]]) one cyclic group for every [[natural number]] $n$, denoted

$$
  \mathbb{Z}_n \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

For $n \gt 0$, the [[order of a group|order]] ([[cardinality]]) of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is $n$ (so [[finite set|finite]]); for $n = 0$, which is the group of [[integers]]

$$
  \mathbb{Z}_0 \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}
$$

the [[order of a group|order]] is [[countable set|countable]] but [[infinite set|infinite]].

If we identify the [[free group]] on the singleton with the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]], then the infinite cyclic group is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself, while the finite cyclic group of order $n$ is $\mathbb{Z}/n$, that is $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo (the [[normal subgroup]] generated by) the integer $n$.  Of course, $\mathbb{Z}$ itself is also $\mathbb{Z}/0$.  One could also consider $\mathbb{Z}/n$ for negative $n$, but this is the same as $\mathbb{Z}/{|n|}$.

The cyclic group of order $n$ may also be identified with a [[subgroup]] of the multiplicative group of [[complex numbers]] (or [[algebraic numbers]]): the group of $n$th roots of $1$.  For $n = 0$, we may pick any non-zero complex number (or even something else) that is *not* a root of $1$ (but there is no standard choice) and take the subgroup generated by it.

Dedicated entries exist for:

* [[cyclic group of order 2]]

* [[cyclic group of order 3]]

* [[cyclic group of order 4]]


## Notation

Besides '$\mathbb{Z}/n$', the cyclic group of order $n$ may also be denoted in other ways: some more complicated variation of '$\mathbb{Z}/n$' (to put 'the \[normal\] subgroup generated by' explicitly in the notation), or else the simplified form '$\mathbb{Z}_n$' (which however conflicts with notation for the $n$-[[adic integers]]).  When written multiplicatively, it may be denoted '$Z_n$' (note the font change) or '$C_n$'; either letter here stands for 'cyclic' in one language or another.  (It is a coincidence that the German words 'Zahl', which gives us '$\mathbb{Z}$', and 'zyklisch', which gives us '$Z$', begin with the same letter.)

Besides '$\mathbb{Z}$', the infinite cyclic group may also be denoted in other ways: some variation of '$(\mathbb{Z},+)$' to indicate that we are using *addition* of integers, or any of the above notations with either '$0$' or '$\infty$' in place of '$n$' (depending on whether we think of it as $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo $0$ or the cyclic group with order $\infty$).

When written additively, the notation for the elements of a cyclic group are usually just the notation for integers; for the finite cyclic group of order $n$, we use the natural number less than $n$.  In the finite case, we may also use brackets or some other notation to indicate [[equivalence classes]].  When written multiplicatively, any letter ('$e$', '$x$', '$a$', '$\xi$', etc) may be taken to stand for the generating element; then any other element is a power of this generator.  When thought of as a multiplicative group of complex numbers, one generator is $\mathrm{e}^{2\mathrm{i}\pi/n}$, and the notation may reflect that.

## Properties

### Ring structure
   {#Ring}

Let $A$ be a cyclic group, and let $x$ be a generator of $A$.  Then there is a unique [[ring]] structure on $A$ (making the original group the additive group of the ring) such that $x$ is the multiplicative identity $1$.

If we identify $A$ with the additive group $\mathbb{Z}/n$ and pick (the equivalence class of) the integer $1$ for $x$, then the resulting ring is precisely the [[quotient ring]] $\mathbb{Z}/n$.

In this way, a cyclic group equipped with the [[extra structure]] of a generator is the same thing (in the sense that their [[groupoids]] are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]]) as a ring with the [[extra property]] that the underlying additive group is cyclic.

For $n \gt 0$, the number of ring structures on the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/n$, which is the same as the number of generators, is $\phi(n)$, the [[totient function|Euler totient]] of $n$; the generators are those $i$ that are [[relatively prime numbers|relatively prime]] to $n$.  While $\phi(1) = 1$, otherwise $\phi(n) \gt 1$ (another way to see that we have a structure and not just a property).  For $\mathbb{Z}$ itself, there are two ring structures, since $1$ and $-1$ are the generators (and these are relatively prime to $0$).

\lineabreak

### Fundamental theorem of cyclic groups
  {#FundamentalTheoremOfCyclicGroups}

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there is precisely one [[subgroup]] of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{N}$ of [[order of a group|order]] $d \in \mathbb{N}$ for each factor of $d$ in $n$, and this is the subgroup [[generators and relations|generated]] by $n/d \in \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.

Moreover, the [[lattice of subgroups]] of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is equivalently the dual of the lattice of natural numbers $\leq n$ ordered by divisibility.

(e.g [Aluffi 09, pages 83-84](#Aluffi09))

This is a special case of the _[[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]]_. See there for more.


### Relation to finite abelian groups

$$
  H^3_{grp}\big(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}, U(1)\big)

### Linear representations

We discuss some of the [[representation theory]] of cyclic groups.

+-- {: .num_example #IrreducibleRealRepresentationsOfCyclicGroups}
###### Example
**([[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real numbers|real]] [[linear representations]] of [[cyclic groups]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 2$,
the [[isomorphism classes]] of [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real numbers|real]] [[linear representations]] of the [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}/n$ are given by precisely the following:

1. the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[trivial representation]] $\mathbf{1}$;

1. the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[sign representation]] $\mathbf{1}_{sgn}$;

1. the 2-[[dimension|dimensional]] standard representations $\mathbf{2}_k$ of [[rotations]] in the [[Euclidean plane]] by [[angles]] that are [[integer]] multiples of $2 \pi k/n$, for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $0 \lt k \lt n/2$;

   hence the [[restricted representations]] of the defining real rep of [[SO(2)]] under the [[subgroup]] inclusions $\mathbb{Z}/n \hookrightarrow SO(2)$, hence the representations generated by [[real number|real]] $2 \times 2$ [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]] [[matrices]] of the form

   $$

     \theta = 2 \pi \tfrac{k}{n}

   $$ 

  (For $k = n/2$ the corresponding 2d representation is the [[direct sum]] of two copies of the [[sign representation]]: $\mathbf{2}_{n/2} \simeq \mathbf{1}_{sgn} \oplus \mathbf{1}_{sgn}$, and hence not [[irrep|irreducible]]. Moreover, for $k \gt n/2$ we have that $\mathbf{2}_{k}$ is irreducible, but [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\mathbf{2}_{n-k} \simeq \mathbf{2}_{-k}$).

In summary:

$$

## Idea

An [[alternating group]] $A_n$ is a [[subgroup]] of a [[symmetric group]] $S_n$ consisting of the _even_ [[permutations]].

The alternating group $A_n$ is to the [[symmetric group]] $S_n$ as the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$ is to the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$. See also at _[symmetric group -- Whitehead tower](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/permutation#WhietheadTowerAndSupersymmetry)_

## Examples

* The alternating group $A_4$ on four elements is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the orientation-preserving [[tetrahedral group]].

* The alternating group $A_5$ on five elements, of order $60$, is the smallest [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[simple group]]. Geometrically, it may be realized as [[finite subgroup of SO(3)]] which carries a regular [[icosahedron]] into itself: the [[icosahedral group]].

* For all $n \geq 5$, the alternating group $A_n$ is simple. This is true even if $n$ is infinite: define $Alt(X)$ for any set $X$ to consist of all permutations of $X$ each of which fixes all but finitely elements, and which is an even permutation on that finite subset.

## Idea

Given a [[field]] $k$ and a [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **special linear group** $SL(n,k)$ (or $SL_n(k)$) is the [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $SL(n,k) \subset GL(n,k)$ consisting of those linear transformations that preserve the [[volume form]] on the vector space $k^n$.  It can be canonically identified with the group of $n\times n$ [[matrix|matrices]] with entries in $k$ having [[determinant]] $1$.

This group can be considered as a sub[[variety]] of the [[affine scheme|affine space]] $M_{n\times n}(k)$ of square matrices of size $n$ carved out by the equations saying that the [[determinant]] of a matrix is 1.  This [[variety]] is an [[algebraic group]] over $k$, and if $k$ is the field of [[real number|real]] or [[complex numbers]] then it is a [[Lie group]] over $k$.

## Properties


+-- {: .num_prop #SLOverFieldIsPerfect} 
###### Proposition 

The [[special linear group]] $SL_n(\mathbb{F})$ is a [[perfect group]] for any [[field]] $\mathbb{F}$ and any $n \geq 1$, except for the cases of the [[prime fields]] $\mathbb{F}_2$ and $\mathbb{F}_3$.

## Definition

The _special orthogonal group_ or _rotation group_, denoted $SO(n)$, is the [[group]] of [[rotations]] in a  [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] $n$. 

This  is one of the [[classical Lie groups]]. It is the [[connected component]] of the neutral element in the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$.

For instance for $n=2$ we have $SO(2)$ the [[circle group]].

It is the first step in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$

$$
  \cdots \to Fivebrane(n) \to String(n) \to Spin(n) \to SO(n) \to \mathrm{O}(n)
  \,,
$$

the next step of which is the [[spin group]]. 

In [[physics]] the rotation group is related to [[angular momentum]].

## Definition

For a [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **unitary group** $U(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of the $n$-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]] $\mathbb{C}^n$.   This is canonically identified with the group of $n \times n$ [[unitary matrices]].


More generally, for a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, $U(\mathcal{H})$ is the group of [[unitary operator]]s on that Hilbert space. For the purposes of studying unitary representations of Lie groups, the topology is chosen to be the [[operator topology|strong operator topology]], although other topologies on $U(\mathcal{H})$ are frequently considered for other purposes. 

## Properties

The unitary groups are naturally [[topological group]]s and [[Lie groups]] (infinite dimensional if $\mathcal{H}$ is infinite dimensional).

+-- {: .num_prop #UnitaryGroupIsCompact}
###### Proposition

The unitary group $U(n)$ is [[compact topological space]], hence in particular a [[compact Lie group]].

### Homotopy groups
 {#HomotopyGroups}

+-- {: .num_prop #InclusionOfUnitaryGroupnIntoUnitaryGroupnPlusIneIsnMinus1Equivalence}
###### Proposition

For $n,N \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \leq N$, then the canonical inclusion of unitary groups

$$
  U(n) \hookrightarrow U(N)
$$

is a [[n-equivalence|2n-equivalence]], hence induces an [[isomorphism]] on [[homotopy groups]] in degrees $\lt 2n$ and a [[surjection]] in degree $2n$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the [[coset]] [[quotient]] [[projection]]

$$
  U(n)
  \longrightarrow
  U(n+1)
  \longrightarrow
  U(n+1)/U(n)
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{UnitaryGroupIsCompact} and by [this corollary](coset#QuotientProjectionForCompactLieSubgroupIsPrincipal), the projection $U(n+1)\to U(n+1)/U(n)$ is a [[Serre fibration]]. Furthermore, example \ref{nSphereAsUnitaryCosetSpace} identifies the [[coset]] with the [[n-sphere|(2n+1)-sphere]] 

$$
  S^{2n+1}\simeq U(n+1)/U(n)
  \,.
$$

Therefore the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] of the [[fiber sequence]] $U(n)\to U(n+1) \to S^{2n+1}$ is of the form

$$
  \cdots
    \to
  \pi_{\bullet+1}(S^{2n+1})
    \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(U(n))
    \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(U(n+1))
    \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(S^{2n+1})
   \to
  \cdots
$$

Since $\pi_{\leq 2n}(S^{2n+1}) = 0$, this implies that 

$$
  \pi_{\lt 2n}(U(n))
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\lt 2n}(U(n+1))
$$

is an isomorphism and that

$$
  \pi_{2n}(U(n))
    \longrightarrow
  \pi_{2n}(U(n+1))
$$

is surjective. Hence now the statement follows by induction over $N-n$.


=--

It follows that the [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_k(U(n))$ are independent of $n$ for $n \gt \frac{k}{2}$ (the "stable range"). So if $U = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n U(n)$, then $\pi_k(U(n)) = \pi_k(U)$. By [[Bott periodicity]] we have

$$
\array{
\pi_{2k+0}(U) &= 0\\
\pi_{2k+1}(U) &= \mathbb{Z}.
}
$$

In the unstable range for low $n$ they instead start out as follows 

| $G$ | $\pi_1$ | $\pi_2$ | $\pi_3$ | $\pi_4$ | $\pi_5$ | $\pi_6$ | $\pi_7$ | $\pi_8$ | $\pi_9$ | $\pi_10$ | $\pi_11$ | $\pi_12$ | $\pi_13$ | $\pi_14$ | $\pi_15$ |

| $U(1)$ | $\mathbb{Z}$ | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

| $U(8)$ | " | " | " | " | " | " | " | " | " | " | " | " | " | 0 | $\mathbb{Z}$ |

Due to the [[unitary group#SUn | relation to the special unitary group]], the higher homotopy groups of $U(n)$ and $SU(n)$ agree. The $U(2)$ row can be found using the fact that $SU(2)$ is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]] $S^3$. The $U(3)$ row can be found using [Mimura-Toda 63](#MimuraToda63). Otherwise the table is given in columns $\pi_k$, $k= 6,\ldots, 15$, and in rows $U(n)$, $n=4,\ldots,8$, by the [[Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics]], Table 6.VII in Appendix A.

### In infinite dimension

A good discussion about the various topologies one might place on $U(\mathcal{H})$ and how they all agree and make $U(\mathcal{H})$ a [[Polish space|Polish]] group is in ([Espinoza-Uribe](#EspinozaUribe)).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{H}$ a [[Hilbert space]], which can be either finite or infinite dimensional, the unitary group $U(\mathcal{H})$ and the [[general linear group]] $GL(\mathcal{H})$, regarded as [[topological group]]s, have the same [[homotopy type]]. 

Additionally, $U(\mathcal{H})$ is a [[maximal compact subgroup]] of $GL(\mathcal{H})$ for finite-dimensional $\mathcal{H}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[Gram-Schmidt process]].

=--


+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
**(Kuiper's theorem)**

For a separable infinite-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$, the unitary group $U(\mathcal{H})$ is [[contractible]] in the [[norm topology]].

=--

See also [[Kuiper's theorem]]. Note that $U(\mathcal{H})$ is also contractible in the [[strong operator topology]] (due to Dixmier and Douady).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This in contrast to the finite dimensional situation. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ($n \ge 1$), $U(n)$ is not contractible.

=--


Write $B U(n)$ for the [[classifying space]] of the [[topological group]] $U(n)$. Inclusion of matrices into larger matrices gives a canonical sequence of inclusions

$$
  \cdots \to B U(n) \hookrightarrow B U(n+1) \hookrightarrow B U(n+2) \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

The [[homotopy limit|homotopy]] [[direct limit]] over this is written

$$
  B U := {\lim_\to}_n B U(n)
$$

or sometimes $B U(\infty)$. Notice that this is very different from $B U(\mathcal{H})$ for $\mathcal{H}$ an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. See [[topological K-theory]] for more on this.

### Relation to special unitary group {#SUn}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$ is a [[split exact sequence|split]] [[group extension]] of the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ by the [[special unitary group]] $SU(n)$

$$
  SU(n) \to U(n) \to U(1)
  \,.
$$

Hence it is a [[semidirect product group]]

$$
  U(n) \simeq SU(n) \rtimes U(1)
  \,.
$$

=--

### Relation to orthogonal, symplectic and general linear group
 {#RelationToOrthogonalSymplecticAndGeneralLinearGroup}

The unitary group $U(n)$ is equivalently the [[intersection]]
of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(2n)$, the [[symplectic group]] $Sp(2n,\mathbb{R})$ and the complex [[general linear group]] $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ inside the real [[general linear group]] $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$.

Actually it is already the intersection of any two of these three, 
a fact also known as the "2 out of 3-property" of the unitary group.

This intersection property makes a [[G-structure]] for $G = U(n)$ (an [[almost Hermitian structure]]) precisely a joint [[orthogonal structure]], [[almost symplectic structure]] and [[almost complex structure]]. In the [[integrability of G-structure|first-order integrable case]] this is precisely a joint [[orthogonal structure]] ([[Riemannian manifold]] structure), [[symplectic structure]] and [[complex structure]].

## Examples

$U(1)$ is the [[circle group]].

### Coset spaces

+-- {: .num_example #nSphereAsUnitaryCosetSpace}
###### Example

The [[n-spheres|(2n+1)-spheres]] are [[coset spaces]] of unitary groups

$$
  S^{2n+1} \simeq U(n+1)/U(n)
  \,.
$$

=--



+-- {: .num_example #ComplexStiefelManifold}
###### Example

For $n \leq k$, the [[coset]]

$$
   V_n(\mathbb{C}^k) \coloneqq U(k)/U(k-n)
$$

is called the $n$th _complex [[Stiefel manifold]]_ of $\mathbb{C}^k$.

=--



+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The complex [[Stiefel manifold]] $V_n(\mathbb{C}^k)$ (example \ref{ComplexStiefelManifold}) is [[n-connected topological space|2(k-n)-connected]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the [[coset]] [[quotient]] [[projection]]

$$
  U(k-n)
    \longrightarrow
  U(k)
    \longrightarrow
  U(k)/U(k-n) 
    = 
  V_n(\mathbb{C}^k)
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{UnitaryGroupIsCompact} and by [this corollary](QuotientProjectionForCompactLieSubgroupIsPrincipal) the projection $U(k)\to U(k)/U(k-n)$ is a [[Serre fibration]]. Therefore there is induced the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] of this [[fiber sequence]], and by prop. \ref{InclusionOfUnitaryGroupnIntoUnitaryGroupnPlusIneIsnMinus1Equivalence} it has the following form in degrees bounded by $n$:

$$
  \cdots
    \to
  \pi_{\bullet \leq 2(k-n)}(U(k-n))
    \overset{epi}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet \leq 2(k-n)}(U(k))
    \overset{0}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet \leq 2(k-n)}(V_n(\mathbb{C}^k))
    \overset{0}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet-1 \lt 2(k-n)}(U(k))
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet-1 \lt 2(k-n)}(U(k-n))
    \to
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

This implies the claim.

## Idea
 {#Idea}

For $C$ a [[cartesian monoidal category]] (a category with [[finite products]]), an *internal ring* or a *ring object* in $C$ is an [[internalization]] to the category $C$ of the notion of a [[ring]].

Under some reasonable assumptions on $C$ that allow one to construct a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal category|monoidal]] [[tensor product]] on the [[category]] of [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group objects]] $Ab(C)$ [[internalization|internal]] to $C$, a ring object can also be defined as a [[monoid object]] internal to that monoidal category $Ab(C)$. 

Sometimes one might take this last point of view a little further, especially in certain contexts of [[stable homotopy theory]] where a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectra]] is already something like an [[(∞,1)-category]]-analogue of a [[category of abelian groups]]. With the understanding that a [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] plays a role analogous to [[tensor products of abelian groups]], monoids with respect to the [[smash product]] are often referred to as "$xyz$-rings" of one sort or another (as mentioned at "[[ring operad]]"). Thus we have carry-over phrases from the early days of stable homotopy theory, such as "[[A-∞ rings]]" (for monoids) and "[[E-∞ rings]]" (commutative monoids). Here it is understood that the monoid multiplication on spectra is an $(\infty, 1)$-refinement of a multiplicative structure on a corresponding [[cohomology theory]], with various forms of [[K-theory]] providing archetypal examples. 


## Definition 
 {#Definition}

### Traditional definition

The traditional definition, based on a traditional presentation of the [[equational theory]] of rings, is that a ring object consists of an object $R$ in a [[cartesian monoidal category]] $C$ together with morphisms $a: R \times R \to R$ (addition), $m: R \times R \to R$ (multiplication), $0: 1 \to R$ (zero), $e: 1 \to R$ (multiplicative identity), $-: R \to R$ (additive inversion), subject to [[commutative diagrams]] in $C$ that express the usual ring axioms. 

### As a model of a Lawvere theory
 {#AsAModelOfALawvereTheory}

Let $T$ be the [[Lawvere theory]] for rings, viz. the category [[opposite category|opposite]] to the category of [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]] [[free object|free]] rings (which are non-commutative [[polynomial rings]] $\mathbb{Z}\langle X_1, \ldots, X_n\rangle$) and ring maps between them. Then for $C$ a category with finite products, a _ring object_ in $C$ may be identified with a product-preserving functor $T \to C$. 

### Via the microcosm principle
 {#ViaTheMicrocosmPrinciple}

Alternatively, one may define ring objects following the Baez–Dolan [[microcosm principle]]. Indeed, similarly to how it is possible to define monoids in a monoidal category (a pseudomonoid in $(\mathsf{Cat},\times,\mathsf{pt})$), it is possible to speak of  semiring objects internal to any [[bimonoidal category]] (a pseudomonoid in $(\mathsf{SymMonCats},\otimes_{\mathbb{F}},\mathbb{F})$).

Namely, a **semiring in a [[bimonoidal category]]** $(\mathcal{C},\otimes_{\mathcal{C}},\oplus_{\mathcal{C}},\mathbf{0}_{\mathcal{C}},\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{C}})$ is given by a quintuple $(R,\mu^{+}_{R},\eta^{+}_{R},\mu^{\times}_{R},\eta^{\times}_{R})$ consisting of

  - An object $R$ of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **underlying object** of the semiring;
  - A morphism
    $$\mu^{+}_{R}\colon R\oplus_{\mathcal{C}}R\longrightarrow R$$
    of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **addition morphism of $R$**;
  - A morphism
    $$\mu^{\times}_{R}\colon R\otimes_{\mathcal{C}}R\longrightarrow R$$
    of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **multiplication morphism of $R$**;
  - A morphism
    $$\eta^{+}_{R}\colon\mathbf{0}_{\mathcal{C}}\longrightarrow R$$
    of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **additive unit morphism of $R$**;
  - A morphism
    $$\eta^{\times}_{R}\colon\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{C}}\longrightarrow R$$
    of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **multiplicative unit morphism of $R$**;

satisfying the following conditions:

  1. The triple $(R,\mu^{+}_R,\eta^{+}_R)$ is a [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category | commutative monoid in $\mathcal{C}$]];
  2. The triple $(R,\mu^{\times}_R,\eta^{\times}_R)$ is a [[monoid in a monoidal category | monoid in $\mathcal{C}$]];
  3. The diagrams

     \begin{imagefromfile}
         "file_name": "semiring_in_bimonoidal_bilinearity_1.png",
         "width": 800
     \end{imagefromfile}
 
     corresponding to the semiring axioms $a(b+c)=a b+a c$ and $(a+b)c=a c+b c$ commute;
  4. The diagrams

     \begin{imagefromfile}
         "file_name": "semiring_in_bimonoidal_bilinearity_2_corr.png",
         "width": 500
     \end{imagefromfile}

     corresponding to the semiring axioms $0a=0$ and $a0=0$ commute;

Moreover, for $\mathcal{C}$ a _braided_ bimonoidal category, one defines a **commutative semiring in $\mathcal{C}$** to be a semiring in $\mathcal{C}$ whose multiplicative monoid structure is commutative.

A partial version of this definition first appeared in ([Brun 2006, Definition 5.1](#Brun2006)).

## Examples

* A ring object in [[Top]] is a [[topological ring]].

* A ring object in [[Ho(Top)]] is an [[H-ring]].

* A [[topos]] equipped with a ring object is called a [[ringed topos]], see there for more details.

* The [[affine line]] (see there) is a ring object in the given ambient [[topos]].

For the notion of a semiring in a [[bimonoidal category]] [defined via the microcosm principle](#ViaTheMicrocosmPrinciple), we have the following examples.

 * A semiring in $\left(\mathsf{Sets},\coprod,\times,\emptyset,\times\right)$ is a monoid.
 * A semiring in $\left(\mathsf{CMon},\oplus,\otimes_\mathbb{N},0,\mathbb{N}\right)$ is a semiring.
 * A semiring in $\left(\mathsf{Ab},  \oplus,\otimes_\mathbb{Z},0,\mathbb{Z}\right)$ is a ring.
 * A semiring in $\left(\mathsf{Mod}_R,\oplus,\otimes_R,0,R\right)$ is an associative algebra.
 * A semiring in $\left(\mathsf{Cats},\coprod,\times,\emptyset_{\mathsf{cat}},\mathsf{pt}\right)$ is a strict monoidal category.

# Direct products
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definition

In [[universal algebra]], a __direct product__ is simply a [[product]] in a [[concrete category]] that is [[created limit|created]] by the [[forgetful functor]].

Compare the [[direct sum]], a more complicated concept.


## Examples

Trivially, a [[cartesian product]] of [[sets]] is a direct product in [[Set]].

One of the requirements of a [[topological category]] is that any family of objects must have a direct product, although the term 'direct product' is not used in topology.

Many [[algebraic categories]], such as [[Grp]], [[Ab]], [[Ring]], etc, also have all direct products; this is where the term 'direct product' originated.

The category of ($Set$-valued) models of any [[Lawvere theory]] has all direct products; this includes the examples from algebra above.

# Prime ideals
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

_Prime ideals_ are supposed to be a generalization of [[prime numbers]] from elements of the [[ring]] of [[integers]] to [[ideals]] in the sense of 'ideal elements' of an arbitrary [[ring]] (usually [[commutative ring|commutative]], but also possibly something more general than a ring).  It\'s not clear that they do so; [[maximal ideals]] may do a better job.  (In particular, [[zero]] is *not* a prime number, and the [[zero ideal]] of $\mathbb{Z}$ is not a maximal ideal either; however, it *is* a prime ideal.)  Nevertheless, they have assumed an importance that dwarfs any question of original motivation; indeed, the general definition of [[prime element]] follows prime ideals rather than prime numbers.  (An element of a ring is prime iff its [[principal ideal]] is prime; $0$ is a prime element of $\mathbb{Z}$ but not a prime number.)


## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn #rig}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[rig]] (assumed unital and associative as usual), and let $P$ be a [[two-sided ideal]] in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever $x a y$ does for all $a$:

$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; (\forall\, a \in R,\; x a y \in P) \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$

Also, $P$ is __completely prime__ if $P$ is proper and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever $x y$ does:

$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; x y \in P \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$
=--

Note that every completely prime ideal is prime (using that $R$ is unital).  The converse holds if the rig is commutative (using that $P$ is an ideal).  So in [[commutative algebra]] one usually uses the (simpler) definition of completely prime ideal as the definition of prime ideal:

+-- {: .num_defn #commrig}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring|commutative]] rig, and let $P$ be an [[ideal]] in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever $x y$ does:

$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; x y \in P \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$
=--

Essentially the same definition applies in [[order theory]], using the analogy (which is more than an analogy in the case of a [[distributive lattice]]) between multiplication in a rig and the [[meet]] in an order:

+-- {: .num_defn #lattice}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[lattice]], and let $P$ be an [[ideal]] in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever their meet does:

$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; x \wedge y \in P \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$
=--

There is an infinitary version of this that is called 'complete' but is *not* equivalent to the notion in Definition \ref{rig} of a completely prime ideal from the noncommutative theory:

+-- {: .num_defn #complattice}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[complete lattice]], and let $P$ be an [[ideal]] in $R$.  Then $P$ is __completely prime__ if some element belongs to $P$ whenever the meet of a subset of $R$ does:

$$ \forall\, X \subseteq R,\; \bigwedge X \in P \;\Rightarrow\; \exists\, x \in R,\; x \in X \;\wedge\; x \in P .$$
=--

With a little sublety, this makes sense even when [[meets]] (and [[joins]]) don't always exist:

+-- {: .num_defn #preorder}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[preorder]], and let $P$ be an ideal in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $x$ or $y$ belongs to $P$ whenever every $z$ that precedes both $x$ and $y$ does:

$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; (\forall\, z \in R,\; z \leq x \;\Rightarrow\; z \in P) \;\Rightarrow\; (\forall\, z \in R,\; z \leq y \;\Rightarrow\; z \in P) \;\Rightarrow\; x \in P \;\vee\; y \in P .$$

Also, $P$ is __completely prime__ if $P$ if some element belongs to $P$ whenever every $z$ that precedes every element of a subset of $R$ does:

$$ \forall\, X \subseteq R,\; (\forall\, z \in R,\; (\forall\, x \in R,\; x \in X \;\Rightarrow\; z \leq x) \;\Rightarrow\; z \in P) \;\Rightarrow\; \exists\, x \in R,\; x \in X \;\wedge\; x \in P .$$
=--

Note that a [[prime filter]] in a proset $R$ is a prime ideal in the [[opposite order]] $R^op$, and a [[completely prime filter]] in $R$ is a completely prime ideal in $R^op$.  Again, the meaning of 'completely prime' here is unrelated to its meaning in Definition \ref{rig}.

All of these definitions may be justified by looking at the [[quantale]] of ideals.  As discussed at [[ideals in a monoid]], there is for two-sided ideals an operation of ideal multiplication, making the [[lattice of ideals|ideal lattice]] $Idl(R)$ a quantale (cf. [[Day convolution]]).  Namely, if $I, J$ are ideals, then their product $I J$ is the ideal generated by all products $x y$ with $x \in I, y \in J$ in the case of rigs, or generated by all meets $x \wedge y$ in the case of lattices, or generated by all $z$ satisfying $z \leq x$ and $z \leq y$ in the case of general prosets.  (Note that for a lattice or other proset, $I J$ is equal to the [[intersection]] $I \cap J$.)

With $I J$ suitably defined, every definition above (except the 'complete' ones) can be subsumed below:

+-- {: .num_defn #universal}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a rig or a proset, and let $P$ be an ideal in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if $P$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and $I$ or $J$ is contained in $P$ whenever $I J$ is:

$$ \forall\, I \in Idl(R),\; \forall\, J \in Idl(R),\; I J \subseteq P \;\Rightarrow\; I \subseteq P \;\vee\; J \subseteq P .$$
=--

Because $I J = I \cap J$ in order theory, prime ideals there are the same as [[strongly irreducible ideals]], so the completely prime ideals of that theory are really just [[completely strongly irreducible ideals]] (generalizing from a pair of ideals to an arbitrary set of ideals).  In contrast, the completely prime ideals of noncommutative ring theory are not of much interest; they are a naïve definition that works in the commutative case but not so well in the noncommutative case.

Finally, note that most of these definitions have an extra clause that a prime ideal must be [[proper ideal|proper]].  This can be justified by removing [[bias]].  We state here the unbiased version of \ref{universal}:

+-- {: .num_defn #unbiased}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a rig or a proset, and let $P$ be an ideal in $R$.  Then $P$ is __prime__ if some ideal in the list is contained in $P$ whenever a product of a [[finite list]] of ideals is contained in $P$:

$$ \forall\, n \in \mathbb{N},\; \forall\, I \in Idl(R)^n,\; \prod_{k\in[n]} I_k \subseteq P \;\Rightarrow\; \exists\, k \in [n],\; I_k \subseteq P .$$
=--

As is typical, $n = 1$ is trivial, $n \gt 2$ can be proved from $n = 2$ by [[induction]], and $n = 0$ is the mysterious preliminary clause, in this case that $P$ is proper.  Note that completely prime ideals in a proset arise by generalizing from finite $n$ to arbitrary [[cardinality]].

Unbiased versions of the other definitions are fairly straightforward.  (For prime ideals in a noncommutative rig, the unbiased definition involves a product of the form $a_0 x_0 a_1 x_1 \cdots x_{n-2} a_{n-1} x_{n-1} a_n$; $a_0$ and $a_n$ can be ignored when $n \gt 0$, which is why only $a_1$ appears in the biased definition.  The definition of completely prime ideals in order theory is already unbiased, since $X$ could always be the [[empty set]].)

Sometimes it\'s more fruitful to consider the [[complement]] of a prime ideal.  This is known in [[constructive mathematics]] as an [[anti-ideal]], and this becomes a necessary perspective there, as many common examples fail to satisfy the above definitions constructively.  (To support anti-ideals, a rig must be equipped with a [[tight apartness relation]], which is vacuous in [[classical mathematics]].)  However, the concept is useful even classically.

+-- {: .num_defn #constructive}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[algebra with apartness|rig with apartness]], and let $M$ be a two-sided [[anti-ideal]] in $R$.  Then $M$ is __prime__ if $M$ is [[proper antiideal|proper]] (that is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]]) and $x a y$ belongs to $M$ for some $a$ whenever $x$ and $y$ do:

$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; x \in M \;\Rightarrow\; y \in M \;\Rightarrow\; \exists\, a \in R,\; x a y \in M .$$

Also, $M$ is __completely prime__ if $M$ is proper and $x y$ belongs to $M$ whenever $x$ and $y$ do:

$$ \forall\, x \in R,\; \forall\, y \in R,\; x \in M \;\Rightarrow\; y \in M \;\Rightarrow\; x y \in M .$$
=--

If we ignore the requirement that $M$ be an anti-ideal, then we say that $M$ is an __m-system__ if it is inhabited and satisfies the binary condition of a prime ideal and __multiplicatively closed__ if it owns $1$ and satisfies the binary condition of a completely prime ideal.  (A proper anti-ideal necessarily owns $1$, but an m-system might not, even though by definition it must be inhabited.)  Thus, an ideal in a commutative ring is (classically) prime iff its complement is multiplicatively closed (and analogously for noncommutative rings).


## Examples

In a [[matrix ring]] $M_n(k)$ over a [[field]] $k$, the [[zero ideal]] is prime (really because a matrix ring is a [[simple ring]], where the zero ideal is a [[maximal ideal]]), but (for $n \gt 1$) not *completely* prime.

In the [[ring of integers]] (or the rig of [[natural numbers]]), the prime ideals are precisely the [[principal ideals]] of the [[prime numbers]] together with the [[zero ideal]].  (This is the motivating example, despite not lining up perfectly.)

## Idea

The [[natural numbers]] $0, 1, 2, \ldots$ are [[poset|partially ordered]] by the divisibility relation: $a|b$ if $b = a k$ for some natural number $k$. This poset is in fact a [[lattice]]. The *greatest common divisor* of $a, b$ is their [[meet]] in this lattice. 

## Remarks 

### In the natural numbers

Spelled out, this means that the greatest common divisor of $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$, denoted $\gcd(a, b)$, is the element $d \in \mathbb{N}$ uniquely characterized by the following two conditions: 

* $d|a$ and $d|b$; 

* if $c|a$ and $c|b$, then $c|d$. 

One could equivalently equip the natural numbers with a [[function]] $\gcd:\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ which satisfies the two conditions:

* $\gcd(a, b)|a$ and $\gcd(a, b)|b$; 

* if $c|a$ and $c|b$, then $c|\gcd(a, b)$. 

It is almost but not quite true that "greatest" means greatest with respect to the usual ordering $\leq$. In particular, $0$ is the maximal element with respect to the divisibility ordering, and $\gcd(0, 0) = 0$ according to the definition above. However, there is no "greatest" common divisor of $0$ with itself if we construe "greatest" in the sense of $\leq$: every natural number is a common divisor of $0$ with itself, and there is no $\leq$-greatest natural number! 

Thus, the convention often seen in textbooks, which replaces the second condition above with 

* if $c|a$ and $c|b$, then $c \leq d$ 

or 

* if $c|a$ and $c|b$, then $c \leq \gcd(a, b)$. 

is slightly more awkward, and certainly less "pure" (mixing two relations $|$ and $\leq$). It is also less robust, because the notion of $gcd$ is at bottom an [[ideal]]-theoretic notion: the divisibility order on elements of a [[principal ideal domain]] is a [[preorder]] whose posetal collapse is the collection of ideals, ordered oppositely to [[inclusion]]. Thus, in [[ring]]-theoretic contexts where there is no sensible notion of $\leq$, for example in the ring of [[Gaussian integers]], the notion of $gcd$ still makes perfectly good sense if we use the first formulation above, expressed purely in terms of divisibility. 

From the point of view of principal ideals in a [[pid]] or [[Bézout domain]] $R$, the gcd corresponds to taking their [[join]]: $(\gcd(a, b)) = (a) + (b)$. Thus the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which applies generally to [[Euclidean domains]] $R$, is a way of calculating a generator of $(a) + (b)$ which consists of $R$-linear combinations of $a$ and $b$. 

### In the integers

In the set of [[integers]], the greatest common divisor only results in a [[prelattice]] rather than a lattice, because the divisibility relation is only a [[preorder]] rather than a [[partial order]], due to the fact that there is more than one element of the [[group of units]] of the integers.

## Idea

For $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ two positive [[natural numbers]], their **least common multiple** $LCM(a,b) \in \mathbb{N}$ is the smallest natural number that is divisible by both $a$ and $b$, i.e. such that there exist $n_a, n_n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n_a \cdot a = n_b \cdot b = LCM(a,b)$.

## Remarks

### In the natural numbers

Spelled out, this means that the least common multiple of $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$, denoted $\mathrm{lcm}(a, b)$, is the element $d \in \mathbb{N}$ uniquely characterized by the following two conditions: 

* $a|d$ and $b|d$; 

* if $a|c$ and $b|c$, then $d|c$. 

One could equivalently equip the natural numbers with a [[function]] $\mathrm{lcm}:\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ which satisfies the two conditions:

* $a|\mathrm{lcm}(a, b)$ and $b|\mathrm{lcm}(a, b)$; 

* if $a|c$ and $b|c$, then $\mathrm{lcm}(a, b)|c$. 

It is not true that "least" means least with respect to the usual ordering $\leq$. In particular, $1$ is the minimal element with respect to the divisibility ordering, and $\mathrm{lcm}(1, 1) = 1$ according to the definition above. However, if we construe "least" in the sense of $\leq$, since every natural number is a common multiple of $1$ with itself, then $0$ is the $\leq$-least natural number! 

Furthermore, it is also less robust, because the notion of $lcm$ is at bottom an [[ideal]]-theoretic notion: the divisibility order on elements of a [[principal ideal domain]] is a [[preorder]] whose posetal collapse is the collection of ideals, ordered oppositely to [[inclusion]]. Thus, in [[ring]]-theoretic contexts where there is no sensible notion of $\leq$, for example in the ring of [[Gaussian integers]], the notion of $\mathrm{lcm}$ still makes perfectly good sense if we use the first formulation above, expressed purely in terms of divisibility. 

From the point of view of principal ideals in a [[pid]] or [[Bézout domain]] $R$, the lcm corresponds to taking their [[meet]]: $(\mathrm{lcm}(a, b)) = (a) \cap (b)$. 

### In an arbitrary Bézout unique factorization domain

In an arbitrary [[Bézout domain|Bézout]] [[unique factorization domain]] $R$, the least common multiple function is only a [[prelattice]], because the minimum elements with respect to the least common multiple are given by the group of units $R^\times$. One usually takes the [[quotient monoid]] of the multiplicative structure on $R$ by the group of units $R^\times$ to get a [[lattice]]: thus, the least common multiple is a function $\mathrm{lcm}:R \times R \to R/R^\times$. In particular, in a [[discrete field]] $K$, the quotient $K/K^\times$ is the [[boolean domain]] $\mathrm{bool}$ and the lcm is thus a function $\mathrm{lcm}:K \times K \to \mathrm{bool}$, and in a [[Heyting field]] $F$, the quotient $F/F^\times$ is the [[set]] of [[truth values]] $\Omega$ whose divisibility partial order is the [[opposite poset]] of the usual partial order via [[entailment]], and the lcm is thus a function $\mathrm{lcm}:F \times F \to \Omega$, defined as $\mathrm{lcm}(a, b) \coloneqq \mathrm{isInvertible}(a) \wedge \mathrm{isInvertible}(b)$

## Definition

A [[ring]] $R$ is a **principal ideal domain** if

1. it is an [[integral domain]] (hence in particular a [[commutative ring]])

2. every [[ideal]] in $R$ is a [[principal ideal]]. 

Often _pid_ is used as an abbreviation of "principal ideal domain".

A _pid_ can also be characterized as an [[integral domain]] wich possesses a [[Dedekind-Hasse norm]], making very clear the fact that it is a generalization of an [[Euclidean domain]].

## Examples

* any [[field]]

* the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]]

* a [[polynomial ring]] with [[coefficients]] in a field (in fact, for any commutative ring $R$, the ring $R[x]$ is a pid if and _only if_ $R$ is a field) 

* a [[valuation ring|discrete valuation ring]] (for example, a ring of formal power series over a field) 

* any [[Euclidean domain]]

* in the ring of [[entire function|entire]] [[holomorphic functions]] on $\mathbb{C}$ every finitely generated ideal is principal  ([Helmer 40](#Helmer40)), but the ring is only a [[Bézout domain]].

That both the [[integers]] and the [[polynomial rings]] $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ over [[finite fields]] are principal integral domains with [[finite group|finite]] [[group of units]] is one aspect of the close similarity between the two that is the topic of the [[function field analogy]]. That also the [[holomorphic functions]] on the [[complex plane]] form a [[Bézout domain]] may then be viewed as part of the further similarity that relates the previous two to topics such as [[geometric Langlands duality]]. See at _[[function field analogy -- table]]_ for more on this.

## Properties 


+-- {: .num_lemma} 
###### Lemma 
In a pid $R$, an element $x$ is irreducible iff $(x)$ is a [[maximal ideal]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Suppose $x$ is irreducible and $a \notin (x)$. Then the ideal generated by $a, x$ is principal, say $(b)$. Then $x = b y$ and since $x$ is irreducible, one of $b, y$ is a unit; if $y$ is a unit then $(x) = (b) = (a, x)$ and thus $a \in (x)$, contradiction. So then $b$ must be a unit, i.e., $(b)$ is the improper ideal. Thus $(x)$ has no proper extension: $(x)$ is maximal. 

For any ring $R$, if $(x)$ is maximal and $x = a b$ for a non-unit $a$, then the inclusion $(x) \subseteq (a)$ is an equality by maximality, so $a = x v$ for some $v$. Then $x = x v b$. In an integral domain we conclude $1 = v b$; thus $b$ is a unit.

###### Proposition 
A PID is a [[unique factorization domain]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Working in classical logic, Proposition \ref{noeth} says that the reverse inclusion relation on the set of nonzero ideals is [[well-founded relation|well-founded]]. Let $A$ be the subset of ideals $(a)$ that are products of finitely many (maybe zero!) maximal principal ideals. For any proper ideal $(x) \neq (0)$, if every $(t)$ properly containing $(x)$ can be factored into maximals, then so can $(x)$. (Spelling this out: either $(x)$ is maximal/irreducible, or factors as $(s)(t)$ where both $s$ and $t$ are non-units; $(s)$ and $(t)$ factor into maximals by hypothesis, and therefore so does $(x)$.) Thus $A$ is an inductive set, so by well-foundedness it contains every ideal $(x) \neq (0)$, i.e., $x$ can be factored into irreducibles. 

For uniqueness of the factorization, we first remark that if $p$ is irreducible and $p|a b$, then $p|a$ or $p|b$. (For $R/(p)$ is a [[field]] and thus *a fortiori* an [[integral domain]], so that if $a b \equiv 0 \; mod p$, then $a \equiv 0 \; mod p$ or $b \equiv 0 \; mod p$.) Thus if $p_1 p_2 \ldots p_m = q_1 q_2 \ldots q_n$ are two factorizations into irreducibles of the same element, then $p_1$ divides one of the irreducibles $q_i$, in which case $(p_1) = (q_i)$ and each is a unit times the other, meaning we can cancel $p_1$ on both sides and argue by induction.

## Structure theory of modules

### Free and projective modules 

+-- {: .num_theorem #free} 
###### Theorem 
If $R$ is a pid, then any [[submodule]] $M$ of a [[free module]] $F$ over $R$ is also free. (For the converse statement, see [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+module#submod).) 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
By freeness of $F$, there exists an isomorphism $F \cong \sum_{j \in J} R_j$, a [[coproduct]] of copies $R_j$ of $R$ (as a module over the ring $R$) indexed over a set $J$, which we assume [[well-ordering|well-ordered]] using the [[axiom of choice]]. Define submodules of $F$: 

$$F_{\leq j} \coloneqq \sum_{i \leq j} R_i, \qquad F_{\lt j} \coloneqq \sum_{i \lt j} R_i\,.$$ 

Any element of $M \cap F_{\leq j}$ can be written uniquely as $(x, r)$ where $x \in F_{\lt j}$ and $r \in R_j$. Define a [[homomorphism]]

$$p_j \colon M \cap F_{\leq j} \to R$$ 

by $p_j((x, r)) = r$. The [[kernel]] of $p_j$ is $M \cap F_{\lt j}$, and we have an [[exact sequence]]

$$0 \to M \cap F_{\lt j} \to M \cap F_{\leq j} \to \im p_j \to 0$$ 

where $\im p_j$ is a submodule (i.e., an [[ideal]]) of $R$, hence generated by a single element $r_j$. Let $K \subseteq J$ consist of those $j$ such that $r_j \neq 0$, and for $k \in K$, choose $m_k$ such that $p_k(m_k) = r_k$. We claim that $\{m_k: k \in K\}$ forms a [[basis]] for $M$. 

First we prove [[linear independence]] of $\{m_k\}$. Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i m_{k_i} = 0$, with $k_1 \lt k_2 \lt \ldots \lt k_n$. Applying $p_{k_n}$, we get $a_n p_{k_n}(m_{k_n}) = a_n r_{k_n} = 0$. Since $r_{k_n} \neq 0$, we have $a_n = 0$ (since we are working over a domain). The assertion now follows by [[induction]].  

Now we prove that the $m_k$ generate $M$. Assume otherwise, and let $j \in J$ be the least $j$ such that some $m \in M \cap F_{\leq j}$ cannot be written as a linear combination of the $m_k$, for $k \in K$. If $j \notin K$, then $m \in M \cap F_{\lt j}$, so that $m \in M \cap F_{\leq i}$ for some $i \lt j$, but this contradicts minimality of $j$. Therefore $j \in K$. Now, we have $p_j(m) = r \cdot r_j$ for some $r$; put $m' = m - r m_j$. Clearly 

$$p_j(m') = p_j(m) - r \cdot p_j(m_j) = 0$$ 

and so $m' \in M \cap F_{\lt j}$. Thus $m' \in M \cap F_{\leq i}$ for some $i \lt j$. At the same time, $m'$ cannot be written as a linear combination of the $m_k$; again, this contradicts minimality of $j$. Thus the $m_k$ generate $M$, as claimed.

### Torsion-free modules 

+-- {: .num_prop #torsionfree}
###### Proposition 
A finitely generated [[torsion subgroup|torsionfree]] module $M$ over a pid $R$ is free. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $S$ be a finite set of generators of $M$, and let $T \subseteq S$ be a maximal subset of linearly independent elements. (Unless $M = 0$, then $T$ has at least one element, because $M$ is torsionfree.) We claim that $M$ can be embedded as a submodule of the free module $F$ generated by $T$ (which in turn is the span of $T$ as a submodule $F \subseteq M$). By Theorem \ref{free}, it follows that $M$ is free. 

Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ be the elements of $T$. It follows from maximality of $T$ that for any $m \in S - T$, there is a linear relation 

$$r_m m + r_1 x_1 + \ldots + r_n x_n = 0$$ 

with $r_m \neq 0$. For each $m$ in the complement $S - T$, pick such an $r_m$, and form $r = \prod_{m \in S - T} r_m$. Then the image of the scalar multiplication $\lambda_r \colon M \to M$ factors through $F \subseteq M$, and $M \to \lambda_r(M)$ is monic because $M$ is torsionfree. This completes the proof. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop #flat} 
###### Proposition 
Let $R$ be a pid. Then an $R$-module $M$ is torsionfree if and only if it is [[flat module|flat]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Suppose $M$ is flat. Let $K$ be the field of fractions of $R$; since $R$ is a domain, we have a monic $R$-module map $R \to K$. By flatness, we have an induced monomorphism $M \cong R \otimes_R M \to K \otimes_R M$. For any nonzero $r \in R$, the naturality square 

$$\array{
M & \to & K \otimes_R M \\
 \mathllap{\lambda_r} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{1 \otimes \lambda_r} \\ 
M & \to & K \otimes_R M
}$$ 

commutes, and since the map $1 \otimes \lambda_r$ is multiplication by a non-zero scalar on a vector space, it follows that this map and therefore also $\lambda_r$ is monic, i.e., $M$ is torsionfree. 

In the other direction, suppose $M$ is torsionfree. Any module is the filtered colimit over the system of finitely generated submodules and inclusions between them; in this case all the finitely generated submodules of $M$ are torsion-free and hence free, by Proposition \ref{torsionfree}. Thus $M$ is a filtered colimit of free modules; it is therefore flat by a standard result proved [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/flat+module#filtfree).

### Structure theory of finitely generated modules 

_[[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]_


## In constructive mathematics

In [[constructive mathematics]], many important rings may fail to be principal ideal domains in the na&#239;ve sense; the notion of _[[Bézout domain]]_, in which only the finitely generated ideals are required to be principal, is better behaved.

For instance, the ring of integers is a principal ideal domain if and only if the [[excluded middle|law of excluded middle]] holds: In one direction, the usual proofs rely on being able to [[decidable proposition|decide]] whether any particular integer belongs to the ideal or not. For the converse, let $\varphi$ be an arbitrary proposition. Consider the ideal $\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} | (x = 0) \vee \varphi \}$. By assumption, it is generated by some number $n$. Since the integers are [[decidable equality|discrete]], it holds that $n = 0$ or $n \neq 0$. In the first case $\neg\varphi$ holds, in the second $\varphi$.

However, this ideal cannot be proved to be finitely generated either.  If an ideal is generated by $n_1, \ldots, n_k$, then we may form their [[gcd]] one step at a time, which we can do algorithmically.  Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}$ remains a B&#233;zout domain.

On the other hand, we could try to modify the concept of principal ideal domain to recover a concept that is identical to the usual one in [[classical mathematics]] but also includes $\mathbb{Z}$.  For instance, we could demand that every [[decidable subset|decidable]] ideal is principal, or (potentially more strongly) that any ideal generated by a decidable subset is principal.  While these seem to work at first, they are too weak to prove that every PID is a B&#233;zout domain, so we should try to think of something better.

Some authors have tried to define a principal ideal domain as a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[Bézout ring|Bézout]] [[integral domain|domain]], but it is unknown if this still coincides in constructive mathematics with the definition of principal ideal domain above.

## Definition


<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/SomePrimes.jpg" width="60"/>
</div>

A _prime number_ is a nonzero [[natural number]] that cannot be written as a [[multiplication|product]] of finitely many natural numbers (all) other than itself, hence a natural number greater than 1 that is [[division|divisible]] only by 1 and itself.

This means that every [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is, up to re-ordering of factors, _uniquely_ expressed as a product of a tuple of prime numbers:

$$
  n \;=\; 2^{n_1}  \cdot 3^{n_2} \cdot  5^{n_3} \cdot 7^{n_4} \cdot  11^{ n_5 } \cdots
$$

This is called the _prime factorization_ of $n$.

Notice that while the number $1 \in \mathbb{N}$ is, clearly, only divisible by one and by itself, hence might look like it deserves to be counted as a prime number, too, this would break the uniqueness of this prime factorization. In view of the general phenomenon in classifications in [[mathematics]] of some objects being _[[too simple to be simple]]_ one could say that 1 is "too prime to be prime".

However, historically, some authors did count 1 as a prime number, see e.g. [Roegel 11](#Roegel11).


## Relation to ideals and arithmetic geometry
  {#RelationToIdeals}

A number is prime if and only if it generates a [[maximal ideal]] in the [[rig]] $\mathbb{N}$ of [[natural numbers]].

Prime numbers do *not* quite match the [[prime elements]] of $\mathbb{N}$, since $0$ generates a [[prime ideal]] but not a maximal ideal; instead they match the [[irreducible elements]] ([Wikipedia](http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Irreducible_element)).

From the [[Isbell duality|Isbell-dual]] point of view, where a [[commutative ring]] such as the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is regarded as the [[ring of functions]] on some [[variety]], namely on [[Spec(Z)]], the fact that prime numbers $p$ correspond to [[maximal ideals]] means that they correspond to the _[[closed points]]_ in this variety (see [this Example](Zariski+topology#SpecZ)), one also writes

$$
  (p) \in Spec(\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

This [[Isbell duality|dual]] perspective on [[number theory]] as being the [[geometry]] ([[algebraic geometry]]) over [[Spec(Z)]] is called _[[arithmetic geometry]]_.

## Statement

Classically, the **fundamental theorem of algebra** states that 

* The [[field]] of [[complex number]]s $\mathbb{C}$ is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In other words, every nonconstant [[polynomial function]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{C}$ has a [[root]] in $\mathbb{C}$. 

Since every non-zero polynomial could be made a [[monic polynomial]] by dividing by the leading coefficient, it could also be expressed as

* The [[field]] of [[complex number]]s $\mathbb{C}$ is [[integrally closed field|integrally closed]]. In other words, every [[monic polynomial|monic]] [[polynomial function]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{C}$ has a [[root]] in $\mathbb{C}$. 

Many proofs of this theorem are known (see the [references](#References) below); some use [[complex analysis]] (the reciprocal of a [[polynomial function]] cannot be bounded), some use [[algebraic topology]] (the degree of a map is invariant with respect to homotopy), and some use advanced calculus (polynomial functions on the complex numbers are [[open map|open mappings]]). All of these proofs involve, at some level, the fact that the real numbers are [[Dedekind real number|Dedekind complete]], which has as a consequence the fact that the real numbers are [[archimedean field|archimedean]]. 

## Algebraic proof via real closed fields 

Despite its name, the fundamental theorem of algebra makes reference to a concept from [[analysis]] (the field of complex numbers).  However, the analytic part may be reduced to a minimum: that the field of [[real numbers]] is [[real closed field|real closed]].  This has been known essentially forever, and is easily proved using (for example) the [[intermediate value theorem]].

The rest of the proof is algebraic and, unlike the other proof methods, applies to all [[real closed field]]s, which need not be archimedean. It is due to [[Emil Artin]], and forms a basic chapter in the Artin--Schreier theory of real closed fields.

We recall that a _real closed field_ is an [[ordered field]] such that every positive element has a [[square root]], and every polynomial function of odd degree has a root.  Note that the polynomial function $x^2 + 1$ cannot have any root in a real closed field --- or in fact in any ordered field, since we always have $x^2\ge 0$ and hence $x^2+1 \ge 1$.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem 
If $F$ is real closed, then $K = F[\sqrt{-1}]$ is algebraically closed. 
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We must show that any [[irreducible polynomial]] $p$ of degree greater than $0$ with coefficients in $K$ has a root in $K$. Since $F$ has characteristic $0$, it is a [[perfect field]]. 

Thus the [[splitting field]] of $p$ is a finite [[Galois extension]] $L$ of $F$, with [[Galois group]] $G$. If $G(2)$ is the [Sylow 2-group](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/class+equation#sylow_theorems) of $G$, then the [[fixed field]] $E$ of $G(2)$ is an odd degree extension of $F$. Any $\alpha \in E$ must then have an irreducible polynomial function $q \in F[x]$ of odd degree. But since $F$ is real closed, $q$ has a root in $F$; by irreducibility, $\deg(q) = 1$ and $\alpha \in F$, forcing $E = F$ and $G = G(2)$. We have ${|G|} \gt 1$ since the splitting field contains $K$. 

So $G$ is a $2$-[[primary group]]. But for any [[prime number]] $p$, a nontrivial finite $p$-group has nontrivial [[center]] (see [here](/nlab/show/class+equation#pgroup)), and is therefore [[solvable group|solvable]] by an inductive argument. Therefore the extension $L/F$ arises from a tower of non-trivial [[quadratic extension]]s 

$$F \subseteq L_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq L_n = L$$ 

By the [[quadratic formula]], the first field $L_1$ arises by adjoining roots to $F$ of a polynomial function $x^2 + a x + b$, 

$$\frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2},$$ 

where $a^2 - 4b$ is negative. Since $F$ is real closed, the positive element $4b - a^2$ has a square root in $F$, so that the roots displayed above belong to $K = F[\sqrt{-1}]$. So $L_1 = K$. But $K$ has no nontrivial quadratic extensions by the lemma that follows, so in fact $L_1 = L_n = K$ and the theorem is proved. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_lemma #sqrt}
###### Lemma 
Every element of $K = F[\sqrt{-1}]$ has a square root in $K$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The proof is most easily apprehended by analogy with polar coordinate representations of complex numbers and half-angle formulas, where a square root of $r e^{i\theta}$ is given by $r^{1/2}e^{i\theta /2}$. Let $i$ be a fixed square root of $-1$, and let $a + b i$ be an arbitrary element of $K$, with $a, b \in F$. We must solve $(x + y i)^2 = a + b i$, i.e., find $x, y \in F$ that solve 

$$x^2 - y^2 = a, \qquad 2x y = b$$ 

Since $a^2 + b^2$ has a square root in $F$, we may assume by homogeneity in $x, y$ that $(a, b)$ is on the unit circle: $a^2 + b^2 = 1$. By interchanging $x$ and $y$ if need be, we may assume $0 \leq a \leq 1$; replacing $y$ by $-y$ if need be, we may assume $b \geq 0$. Taking $x, y \geq 0$ such that 

$$x^2 = \frac{1+a}{2}, \qquad y^2 = \frac{1-a}{2},$$ 

we obtain a solution (since $x^2 - y^2 = a$ and $4 x^2 y^2 = b^2$).

## Classical FTA via advanced calculus 

As noted above, many proofs of the fundamental theorem are known. The following proof, ultimately rooted in the fact that [[polynomial mappings]] on $\mathbb{C}$ are [[open mappings]], has the advantage that it requires very little machinery. From what I ([[Todd Trimble]]) understand, it is close to the method used by Argand to give his proof (1814)[^1]. 

[^1]: Despite the credit given to Gauss for his demonstration of 1799, Argand's proof is often credited as the first one that is *fully rigorous*. The proof given here also uses the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, first proven by Bolzano in 1817, making it somewhat contemporaneous. Argand is also widely credited as the one who introduced the cutting-edge idea of viewing complex numbers and their operations *geometrically*, which the proof here also uses (the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ being also known as the Argand plane). 

Let $f\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ be a nonconstant polynomial mapping, and suppose $f$ has no zero. 

1. Let $s$ be the [[infimum]] of values ${|f(z)|}$; choose a [[sequence]] $z_1, z_2, z_3, \ldots$ such that ${|f(z_n)|} \to s$. Since $\lim_{z \to \infty} f(z) = \infty$, the sequence $z_n$ must be bounded; by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem it has a [[sequence|subsequence]] $z_{n_k}$ that converges to some point $z_0$. Then ${|f(z_{n_k})|}$ converges to ${|f(z_0)|}$ by continuity, and converges to $s$ as well, so ${|f(z)|}$ attains an absolute minimum $s$ at $z = z_0$. By supposition, $f(z_0) \neq 0$. 

2. The polynomial function $f$ may be uniquely written in the form 
$$f(z) = f(z_0) + g(z)(z - z_0)^n$$ 
where $g$ is polynomial function and $g(z_0) \neq 0$. Put 
$$F(z) = f(z_0) + g(z_0)(z - z_0)^n$$ 
and choose $\delta \gt 0$ small so that 
$${|z - z_0|} = \delta \Rightarrow {|g(z) - g(z_0)|} \lt {|g(z_0)|}.$$ 

3. $F$ maps the circle $C = \{z : {|z - z_0|} = \delta\}$ _onto_ a circle of radius $r = {|g(z_0)|}\delta^n$ centered at $f(z_0)$. (This uses the fact that any complex number has an $n^{th}$ root, which one can prove using polar coordinate representations. We omit the details.) Choose $z' \in C$ so that $F(z')$ is on the line segment between the origin and $f(z_0)$ (we can always choose $\delta$ so that also $r \lt {|f(z_0)|}$). Then 
$${|F(z')|} = {|f(z_0)|} - r$$
We also have 
$${|f(z') - F(z')|} = {|g(z') - g(z_0)|} {|z' - z_0|^n} \lt {|g(z_0)|} \delta^n = r$$ 
according to how we chose $\delta$ in 2. We conclude by observing the strict inequality 
$${|f(z')|} \leq {|F(z')|} + {|f(z') - F(z')|} \lt {|f(z_0)|} - r + r = {|f(z_0)|},$$ 
which contradicts the fact that ${|f(z)|}$ attains an absolute minimum at $z = z_0$.  


## In weak foundations

Many proofs rely explicitly on the [[double negation]] rule by first supposing that a polynomial function $p$ has no root and deriving a contradiction.  

### In constructive mathematics

In [[constructive mathematics]], [[integral closure]] and [[algebraic closure]] of a [[field]] are not the same, because not every nonconstant polynomial function has a well-defined degree. This is still the case even if we take "nonconstant polynomial function", we mean "[[tight apartness relation|apart from]] every constant polynomial function". In general, every nonconstant polynomial function has a well-defined degree if and only if the field is a [[discrete field]]. 

Thus, the fundamental theorem of algebra is usually expressed in terms of integral closure:

* The [[field]] of [[complex number]]s $\mathbb{C}$ is [[integrally closed field|integrally closed]]. In other words, every [[monic polynomial|monic]] [[polynomial function]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{C}$ has a [[root]] in $\mathbb{C}$. 

A fully choice-free constructive proof by Wim Ruitenberg ([Ruitenberg 1991](#Ruitenberg91)) exists for the [[modulated Cantor real number|modulated Cantor complex numbers]] (which agree with the [[Dedekind real number|Dedekind complex numbers]] by [[weak countable choice]] or the [[limited principle of omniscience]]).

The algebraic proof of other fields of real numbers is problematic in many ways. 

First, one might wish to use the [[inverse function theorem]] to prove that the square root of every non-negative number exists; however, the inverse function theorem only proves that the square root of every positive number exists, since the inverse function theorem leads to continuous inverses, which for the square function is the [[continuous square root]], which is only defined on the positive real numbers. The [[metric square root]], which is defined on the non-negative real numbers, is not continuous at $0$. 

The second problem is Lemma \ref{sqrt}. This may fail in a [[topos]] (such as [[sheaves]] over $\mathbb{C}$), since we may not be able to find a square root of a complex number $x$ (or element of $K[\sqrt{-1}]$ more generally) if we do not know whether or not $x$ is apart from zero, because there is no [[continuous map|continuous]] square-root function unless one assumes [[weak countable choice]]. 

[[Fred Richman]] ([1998](#Richman)) has proposed that, in the absence of $WCC$, the FTA should be interpreted as a statement about sets of roots rather than about individual roots.  He constructs a [[complete metric space]] $\hat{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ which, classically, is the space of $n$-element [[multisets]] of complex numbers (and constructively is the completion of that space) and proves that every complex polynomial function $p$ of degree $n$ may be associated with a point in this space in such a way that the $n$ elements of that point (when viewed as a multiset, if possible, and morally in any case) are the $n$ roots of $p$.

### In RCA_0

Assuming classical logic, but weak foundations, it can be shown that FTA is true in the [[reverse mathematics]] system $RCA_0$ ([Tanaka-Yamazaki 2005](#TY2005)).


## History
 {#History}

The proof was attempted many times before Gauss gave what is accepted as the first proof in his dissertation ([Gauss 1799](#Gauss1799)), although this was not without issues (Gauss 'fixed' this proof almost 50 years later, but the last gap was not filled until the 20th century).

All proofs of this fact (of which there are many) require something analytic, in the sense that ordinary algebra will not suffice: one needs to know that the real numbers (or the complex numbers) 'have no algebraic gaps'. For instance, the rational numbers famously don't contain the square root of $2$. The cleanest proof I know, due to Artin, that isolates this analytic germ, uses the step-ladder result that the real numbers form what is called a [[real closed field]]. This is essentially saying that non-negative real numbers have square roots, and odd degree polynomial functions have roots (anyone who has plotted a cubic can appreciate this fact). Alternatively, one can characterise real closed fields as those for whom the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) holds for polynomial functions. Accepting this result (which does need proof), the FTA follows using pure algebra (although not of the high-school sort).

However, it is of interest, partly theoretical, partly for the sake of finding the bare minimum needed to prove the FTA, to know an elementary proof, namely one that minimises the use of analytic techniques (for instance, the IVT for polynomial functions follows from the IVT for continuous functions, but that is like killing a mosquito with a bazooka). Gauss' second proof ([Gauss 1866](#Gauss1866)) is elementary (and predates Artin's by a long time). Since Gauss lacked modern algebraic techniques, some of his proof is laborious, but ([Taylor 85](#Taylor85)) gives a modern gloss. (With some amusing side notes: as Taylor puts it -- 'Gauss takes the opportunity [to] be rude to his inferior contemporaries'.) Gauss' proof, in modern language, takes up less than a page and a half, but this presupposes familiarity with some of the theory of fields (but which is pure algebra). Artin's proof, by comparison, drawing on major theorems can be given in half a page.

It should be noted, in the context of the last statement, that proofs of the FTA can be given, relying on analytic 'bazooka' theorems, that are one sentence. However, to spell out the proofs of the necessary theorems, one needs a course in analysis, of some variety, so one is merely sweeping a lot under a very small rug.

## Idea

A [[field]] with [[finite set|finitely]] many elements. 

## Structure 

Let $F$ be a finite field. As $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[initial object]] in the category of [[rings]], there is a unique ring [[homomorphism]] $\mathbb{Z} \to F$, whose [[(epi, mono) factorization system|regular epi-mono factorization]] is 

$$\mathbb{Z} \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{Z}/(p) \hookrightarrow F;$$ 

here $p$ is [[prime number|prime]] (irreducible) since any subring of a field has no [[zero divisors]]. Here $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ is a [[prime field]], usually denoted $\mathbb{F}_p$. 

Thus we have an inclusion of fields $\mathbb{F}_p \to F$; in particular $F$ is an $\mathbb{F}_p$-[[module]] or [[vector space]], clearly of finite dimension $n$. It follows that $F$ has $q = p^n$ elements. 

In addition, since the multiplicative group $F^\times$ is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (as shown for example at [[root of unity]]), of order $q - 1$, it follows that $F$ is a [[splitting field]] for the polynomial $x^{q-1} - 1 \in \mathbb{F}_p[x]$. As splitting fields are unique up to isomorphism, it follows that up to isomorphism there is just one field of cardinality $q = p^n$; it is denoted $\mathbb{F}_q$.[^fine]

[^fine]: There is no 'canonical' choice of such a splitting field, just as there is no canonical choice of algebraic closure. So 'morally' there is something wrong with saying '[[the]]' finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, although this word usage can be found in the literature. In the special case $n = 1$ there is no problem: Given fields containing $p$ elements are isomorphic _in a unique way_.

The [[Galois group]] $Gal(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}/\mathbb{F}_p)$ is a cyclic group of order $n$, generated by the [[automorphism]] $\sigma: \mathbb{F}_{p^n} \to \mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ sending $x \mapsto x^p$. (One way to see that $\sigma$ preserves addition is to write ([[binomial theorem]]) 

$$\array{
(x + y)^p & = & \sum_{i=0}^p \binom{p}{i} x^i y^{p-i} \\ 
 & = & x^p + y^p
}$$ 

where the second equation follows from the fact that the integer $p$ divides the numerator of $\frac{p!}{i!(p-i)!}$, but neither factor of the denominator, if $0 \lt i \lt p$. This is true for any [[commutative algebra]] over $\mathbb{F}_p$; see [[freshman's dream]].) 

This $\sigma$ is called the Frobenius (auto)morphism or [[Frobenius map]]. More generally, if $m$ divides $n$, then $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ is the fixed field of the automorphism $\sigma^m: x \mapsto x^{p^m}$, and $Gal(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}/\mathbb{F}_{p^m})$ is a cyclic group of order $n/m$ that is generated by this automorphism, which is also called the Frobenius map (for the field extension $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}/\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$), or just "the Frobenius" for short. 

If $K = \widebar{\mathbb{F}_p}$ is an [[algebraic closure]] of $\mathbb{F}_p$, then $K$ is the union (a [[filtered colimit]]) of the system of such finite field extensions $\mathbb{F}_q$ and inclusions between them. If $q = p^n$, then $\mathbb{F}_q$ may be defined to be the fixed field of the automorphism $\sigma^n: K \to K$. 

The Galois group $Gal(K/\mathbb{F}_p)$ is the inverse limit of the system of finite cyclic groups and projections between them; it is isomorphic to the profinite completion 

$$\widehat{\mathbb{Z}} = \hom(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}) \cong \prod_{primes\; p} \mathbb{Z}_p$$ 

where $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the group of $p$-[[p-adic integers|adic integers]].

A [[topological manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is by definition a [[topological space]] that is locally [[homeomorphic]] to a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$. A choice of such morphism

$$
  \phi : \mathbb{R}^n \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X|_{im(\phi)} \hookrightarrow X
$$

is a **coordinate system** or **coordinate chart** or just **chart** on the [[image]] of $\phi$.

This generalises to other sorts of [[manifolds]].

An [[atlas]] is the collection of coordinate charts defining a manifold structure.

## Definition

For $V$ a [[vector space]] or more generally a $k$-[[module]], then a _quadratic form_ on $V$ is a [[function]]

$$
  q\colon V \to k
$$

which is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree 2 in that for all $v \in V$, $t \in k$

$$
  q(t v) = t^2 q(v)
$$

and such that the _[[polarization identity|polarization]]_ of $q$

$$
  (v,w) \mapsto q(v+w) - q(v) - q(w) 
$$

is a [[bilinear form]].

Written entirely in terms of $q$, the axioms for a quadratic form are:

* $q(t v) = t^2 q(v)$,
* $q(t v + w) + t q(v) + t q(w) = t q(v + w) + t^2 q(v) + q(w)$,
* $q(u + v + w) + q(u) + q(v) + q(w) = q(u + v) + q(u + w) + q(v + w)$.

(Besides the homogeneity, these come from two requirements of a bilinear form to preserve scalar multiplication and addition, respectively.)  So we may alternatively define a __quadratic form__ to be a map $q\colon V \to k$ satisfying these three axioms.

A more general __quadratic map__ (or _homogeneous_ quadratic map to be specific) between vector spaces $V$ and $W$ is a map $q\colon V \to W$ that satisfies the above three conditions.  (Then an _affine_ quadratic map is the sum of a homogeneous quadratic map, a [[linear map]], and a constant, just as an [[affine linear map]] is the sum of a linear map and a constant.)

From the converse point of view, $q$ is a [[quadratic refinement]] of the bilinear form $(-,-)$.  (This always exists uniquely if $2 \in k$ is invertible, but in general the question involves the [[characteristic elements of a bilinear form|characteristic elements]] of $(-u,-)$.  See there for more.)

Quadratic forms with values in the [[real numbers]] $k = \mathbb{R}$ are called _positive definite_ or _negative definite_ if $q(v) \gt 0$ or $q(v) \lt 0$, respectively, for all $v \neq 0$.  See [[definiteness]] for more options.

## Definition

### On an abelian group

For $(G,+)$ an [[abelian group]], then a _norm_ on the group is a [[function]]

$$
  {\vert-\vert} \;\colon\; G \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

to the [[real numbers]], such that 

1. (positivity) $(g \neq 0) \Rightarrow (\vert g\vert \gt 0)$

1. ([[triangle inequality]])  ${\vert g + h\vert}\leq {\vert g\vert} + {\vert h\vert}$ 

1. (linearity) ${\vert k g\vert} = {\vert k\vert} {\vert g\vert}$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Here ${\vert k\vert} \in \mathbb{N}$ denotes the [[absolute value]].

A group with a norm is a _[[normed group]]_, see there for more.

In [[constructive mathematics]], it is common to replace the [[denial inequality]] with a [[tight apartness relation]] in the positivity condition. 

### On a vector space

For $k$ a [[field]] equipped with a [[valuation]] (most usually, a [[local field]] such as $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, or a [[p-adic field|p-adic]] [[complete field|completion]] of a [[number field]]), a **norm** on a $k$-[[vector space]] $V$ is a [[function]] 

$$
  {\vert-\vert} \colon V \to \mathbb{R}
$$ 

such that for all $\lambda \in k$, $v,w \in V$ we have

1.  ${\vert \lambda v \vert} = {\vert \lambda\vert} {\vert v \vert}$ (where $\vert \lambda \vert$ denotes the [[valuation]])

1.  ${\vert v + w\vert } \leq {\vert v \vert } + {\vert w \vert}$ ("[[triangle inequality]]")

1.  if ${\vert v\vert} = 0$ then $v = 0$.

If the third property is not required, one speaks of a **seminorm**.

If the triangle identity is strengthened to 

* ${\vert v + w\vert } \leq max ({\vert v\vert}, {\vert w\vert})$

one speaks of a **[[non-archimedean]]** seminorm, otherwise of an [[archimedean]] one.

A vector space equipped with a norm is a **normed vector space**. A vector of norm 1 is a [[unit vector]].

Each seminorm determines a [[topology]], which is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] precisely if it is a norm.

A [[topological vector space]] is called **(semi-)normed** if its [[topology]] can be induced by a (semi-)norm.

Two seminorms ${\vert - \vert}_1$ and ${\vert - \vert}_2$ are called **equivalent** if there are $0 \lt C, C' \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $v$ we have

$$
  C {\vert v \vert}_1 \leq {\vert v \vert}_2
  \leq C' {\vert v \vert}_1
  \,.
$$

Equivalent seminorms determine the same [[topology]].

The collection of (bounded) multiplicative seminorms on a ([[Banach space|Banach]]) [[ring]] is called its [[analytic spectrum]] (see there for details).


## Examples

### General

* The standard [[absolute value]] is a norm on the [[real numbers]].

* More generally, on any [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ the **Euclidean norm** is given by

   $$
     \vert \vec x\vert
       \;\coloneqq\;
     \sqrt{
     \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum}
       (x_i)^2
     }
     \,.
   $$

1. more generally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $p \in \mathbb{N}$, $p \geq 1$, then the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ carries the _[[p-norm]]_

   $$ 
     {\vert \vec x \vert}_p  \coloneqq \root p {\sum_i {|x_i|^p}} 
   $$

1. The [[p-norm]] generalizes to [[sequence spaces]] and [[Lebesgue spaces]]. 

* [[operator norm]] in [[operator algebra]]/[[functional analysis]]

### Minkowski Functionals

Let $V$ be a vector space and $B \subseteq V$ an [[absorbing]] [[absolutely convex]] subset.  The **Minkowski functional** of $B$ is the function $\mu_B \colon V \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by:

$$
\mu_B(v) = \inf\{t \gt 0 : v \in t B\}
$$

This is a semi-norm on $V$.


## Properties

* [[Hahn-Banach theorem]]

The (open or closed) [[unit ball]] of a seminormed vector space is a [[convex set]], a [[balanced set]] and an [[absorbing set]]. The first two of these properties make the unit ball (or even any ball of positive radius) an [[absolutely convex set]]. 


### Uniqueness {#dreamUnique}

In [[dream mathematics]], a given real [[vector space]] (with no topological structure) can have at most one complete norm, up to topological equivalence ([[homeomorphism]] of the [[identity function]]).  It can have multiple inequivalent complete seminorms and incomplete norms, but their Hausdorff quotients and completions must be different.  For example, the various [[Lebesgue norms]] on a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ for finite $n$ are complete and equivalent; on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, they are inequivalent but incomplete.

As dream mathematics includes [[excluded middle]] and [[dependent choice]], the existence of inequivalent complete norms on a given vector space cannot be proved without a stronger form of the [[axiom of choice]], enough to disprove the [[Baire property]] (which is the only classically false axiom needed in the proof of uniqueness).  In _[[HAF]]_, it is argued that this explains why, in [[applied mathematics]], there tends to be only one norm considered on any particular vector space (after Hausdorff completion).

This theorem applies more generally to [[F-norms]] but not to [[G-norms]] (even on a real vector space).

## Norms valued in another Archimedean integral domain

In [[constructive mathematics]], the notion of "real numbers" bifurcates: the [[Dedekind real numbers]] are different from the [[modulated Cauchy real numbers]], which are different from the [[HoTT book real numbers]], which are different from the [[localic real numbers]], and so on. As a result, there are multiple sets of real numbers in which a metric could be valued in. 

In [[predicative mathematics]], the issue becomes even worse: there is no longer one set of Dedekind real numbers, but a whole hierarchy of Dedekind real numbers, one set for every [[universe]] in the [[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]. As a result, one cannot resort to merely using the [[Dedekind real numbers]] for defining the norm as in impredicative mathematics, one has to define norms and normed spaces more generally. 

Thus, given an [[Archimedean integral domain]] $R$, for $k$ a [[field]] equipped with a [[valuation]], an **$R$-norm** on a $k$-[[vector space]] $V$ is a [[function]] 

$$
  {\vert-\vert} \colon V \to R
$$ 

such that for all $\lambda \in k$, $v,w \in V$ we have

1.  ${\vert \lambda v \vert} = {\vert \lambda\vert} {\vert v \vert}$ (where $\vert \lambda \vert$ denotes the [[valuation]])

1.  ${\vert v + w\vert } \leq {\vert v \vert } + {\vert w \vert}$ ("[[triangle inequality]]")

1.  if ${\vert v\vert} = 0$ then $v = 0$.

One could define $R$-seminorms, non-archimedean $R$-norms, and $R$-normed vector spaces in the same way as above.

# Cross products
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

In general, the term 'cross product' is used for any operation denoted by the symbol '$\times$', such as [[cartesian product]], [[direct product]], [[Tychonoff product]], or (subsuming all of these) [[product|product in a category]].

However, there is another completely different context, used in the elementary analysis of [[vector spaces]], and that is what we discuss here.  Originally isolated from the multiplication operation in [[quaternions]] as a binary operation on $\mathbb{R}^3 \simeq Im(\mathbb{H})$, the cross product now has generalisations to other arities, other dimensions, and other ground fields.


## Definitions

### Classical

The **classical cross product** on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the [[bilinear function]]

$$
  (-) \times (-)\colon \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3
$$

given by

$$ (a,b,c) \times (d,e,f) = (b e - c f, c d - a f, a e - b d) .$$

This operation is invariant under [[orthogonal group|orthogonal transformations]] and there is nothing special here about the [[real numbers]], so given any $3$-dimensional [[orientation|oriented]] [[inner product space]] $V$ over any [[field]], we have a bilinear cross product

$$
  (-) \times (-)\colon V \times V \to V
$$

given, upon choosing any oriented orthonormal basis for $V$, by the formula above.  We can even do this over any [[free module]] of rank $3$ over any [[commutative ring]] (or arguably a non-commutative [[ring]], but not a [[rig]]) equipped (as may always be done) with an inner product that admits an orthonormal basis.


### Binary {#binary}

We have already, trivially, generalized the cross product to other ground fields.  One way to generalise it to other dimensions is to identify characteristic features as a bilinear operation and see what operations in other dimensions have these.

In this vein, a __binary cross product__ on any [[inner product space]] $V$ is a [[bilinear function]]

$$
  (-) \times (-)\colon V \times V \to V
$$

such that for all $x, y\in V$ we have

1. Alternation: $x \times x = 0$.

2. Orthgonality: $x \times y$ is orthogonal to both $x$ and $y$; that is, $x \cdot (x \times y) = (x \times y) \cdot y = 0$.

3. Area: ${\|x \times y\|} = {\|x\|} {\|y\|}$ if $x, y$ are orthogonal.

From these, we can prove a more general formula for ${\|x \times y\|}$:

$$ {\|x \times y\|}^2 = {\|x\|}^2 {\|y\|}^2 - (x \cdot y)^2 ,$$

or equivalently

$$ {\|x \times y\|} = {\|x\|} {\|y\|} {|\sin\angle(x,y)|} .$$

(Using the [[polarization identity]] to express $x \cdot y$ in terms of $\|x\|$, $\|y\|$, and either $\|x + y\|$ or $\|x - y\|$, this is the double of Hero's Formula for the area of a triangle.)

Conversely, using this more general area formula, we can prove both the restricted area formula and alternation, so that only orthogonality is needed as a separate axiom.

We then have over the [[real numbers]]:

* In [[dimension]] $0$ or $1$, there is one binary cross product: $x \times y \coloneqq 0$.

* In dimension $3$, there are two binary cross products, one for each orientation, matching the classical cross product.

* In dimension $7$, there are uncountably many binary cross products.  Even fixing an orthonormal basis and requiring compatibility with this (in that the cross product of any two distinct basis vectors must be another basis vector or its opposite), there are still 480 distinct cross products.

* In any other finite dimension, there are no binary cross products at all.

These cross products exist over any base field, but as far as I know there may be additional cross products over some fields in dimensions greater than $1$.  (The claim that there are uncountably many cross products in $7$ dimensions becomes the claim that the [[algebraic variety]] of these inner products has dimension greater than $0$; even in the real case, it would be worthwhile to describe this variety in more detail.)  If we pick an orthonormal basis and demand compatibility with it, then the classification above is complete over any field (as the problem becomes essentially combinatorial), except that some of these cross products will be identified in characteristic $2$.

Binary cross products are closely related to [[normed division algebras]] (NDAs).  Given a normed division algebra $A$, the imaginary hyperplane $Im(A)$ inherits an inner product from $A$ and gains a cross product as
$$ x \times y \coloneqq Im(x y) = \frac{1}{2}[x,y] = x y + x \cdot y .$$
Conversely, given an inner product space $V$ with a binary cross product, the orthogonal [[direct sum]] $K \oplus V$ becomes a NDA as
$$ (a,x) (b,y) = (a b - x \cdot y, a y + b x + x \times y) ,$$
where $K$ is the ground field.  (Compare the relationship between complex $*$-algebras and [[Jordan--Lie algebras]], where $A$ is $V \oplus V$ instead of $K \oplus V$, which we again think of as consisting of real and imaginary parts and where we again have two multiplication operations on $V$.)

By [[Hurwitz theorem|Hurwitz's theorem]], the only finite-dimensional NDAs over $\mathbb{R}$ are $\mathbb{R}$ itself (the [[real numbers]]), $\mathbb{C}$ (the [[complex numbers]]), $\mathbb{H}$ (the [[quaternions]]), and $\mathbb{O}$ (the [[octonions]]).  Thus the limited possibilities for binary cross products are determined by the limited possibilities for NDA structures.

By one of the deeper strands of mathematics, this classification of something as innocent-looking as cross-products is closely related not just to the existence of [[normed division algebras]] over the [[real numbers]], but also to all of the following: [[parallelizable manifold|parallelizable]] [[n-spheres]], the existence of [[real spin representations]] (see also at _[[supersymmetry and division algebras]]_), and the [[homotopy groups of spheres]] of [[Hopf invariant one]]; see [there](Hopf+invariant+one#RelationToHSpaceStructureAndNormedDivisionAlgebras).


### $(n-1)$-ary {#counary}

Given an [[orientation|oriented]] [[inner product space]] $V$ of finite [[dimension]] $n$, we can define the signed [[volume]] of an $n$-[[tuple]] of vectors.  (See also [[volume form]].)  This allows us to characterise an $(n - 1)$-ary or __co-unary cross product__ of $n - 1$ vectors as a multilinear operation
$$ &#10761;\colon V^{n - 1} \to V $$
such that
$$ v_0 \cdot &#10761;(v_1,\ldots,v_{n-1}) = vol(v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_{n-1}) $$
always.  There is exactly one such cross product on any such $V$ (so two if we start with an unoriented inner product space).

In $3$ dimensions, this also recovers the classical cross product.  In $2$ dimensions, this produces a __unary cross product__ given by ${\times}(a,b) = (b,-a)$; in a counterclockwise-oriented plane, it rotates a vector clockwise through a right angle.  In $1$ dimension, this is a nullary operation (a constant) whose value is the positive normal vector $1$.


### Vector-valued {#vectorvalued}

Generalizing all of the above, let a __vector-valued cross product__ on any [[inner product space]] $V$ be a multilinear function
$$ &#10761;\colon V^k \to V $$
for some [[natural number]] $k$ (called the [[arity]]) such that:

1. Alternation: $&#10761;(v_1,\ldots,v_k) = 0$ if $v_i = v_j$ for some $i \ne j$.

2. Orthgonality: $&#10761;(v_1,\ldots,v_k)$ is orthogonal to each $v_i$.

3. Area: ${\|&#10761;(v_1,\ldots,v_k)\|} = \prod_i {\|v_i\|}$ if the $v_i$ are mutually orthogonal.

We can again extend (3) to get the magnitude of the cross product of any $k$ vectors; its square is the [[determinant]] of the matrix whose $(i,j)$th entry is $v_i \cdot v_j$ (the [[Gram determinant]]), and then (1) again follows.

Then for an inner product space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$ of finite dimension $n$, we have:

* If $k = 0$, then there is one cross product for each [[unit vector]] of $V$: none when $n = 0$, two (one for each orientation) when $n = 1$, and uncountably many when $n \geq 2$ (of which $2n$ are compatible with a given basis).

* If $k = 1$, then there is one cross product for each way of writing $\mathbb{R}^n$ as as $n/2$-fold [[internal direct sum]] of $2$-dimensional subspaces and orienting each subspace: one (always $0$) when $n = 0$, two (one for each orientation) when $n = 2$, uncountably many when $n \geq 4$ is even (of which $2^{n/2}(n-1)!!$ are compatible with a given basis), and none when $n$ is odd.

* If $k = 2$, then the possibilities are as listed [above](#binary) for binary cross products: one (always $0$) when $n = 0, 1$, two (one for each orientation) when $n = 3$, uncountably many (related to the octonions, and of which $480$ are compatible with a given basis) when $n = 7$, and none when $n \ne 0, 1, 3, 7$.

* If $k = 3$, then there is one cross product (always $0$) when $n = 0, 1, 2$, two cross products (one for each orientation) when $n = 4$, uncountably many cross products (related to the octonions) when $n = 8$, and none when $n \ne 0, 1, 2, 4, 8$.

* If $4 \leq k \lt n - 1$, then there are no cross products.

* If $k = n - 1$, then there are two cross products, one for each orientation, as described [above](#counary) for $(n-1)$-ary cross products.

* If $k = n$, then there are no cross products.

* If $k \geq n + 1$, then there is one cross product (always $0$).

Or organized by dimension ($n$) rather than arity ($k$):

* If $n = 0$, then there is no cross product when $k = 0$ and one cross product (always zero) when $k \geq 1$.

* If $n = 1$, then there are two cross products (one for each unit vector, or equivalently for each orientation) when $k = 0$, none when $k = 1$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq 2$.

* If $n = 2$, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which four are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = 1$, none when $k = 2$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq 3$.

* If $n = 3$, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which six are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, none when $k = 1$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = 2$, none when $k = 3$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq 4$.

* If $n = 4$, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which eight are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, uncountably many (four for each $2$-dimensional subspace, and of which twelve are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 1$, none when $k = 2$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = 3$, none when $k = 4$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq 5$.

* If $n = 5$, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which ten are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, none when $k = 1, 2, 3$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = 4$, none when $k = 5$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq 6$.

* If $n = 6$, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which twelve are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, uncountably many (related to the $2$-dimensional decompositions, and of which $120$ are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 1$, none when $k = 2, 3, 4$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = 5$, none when $k = 6$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq 7$.

* If $n = 7$, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which $14$ are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, none when $k = 1$, uncountably many (related to the octonions, and of which $480$ are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 2$, none when $k = 3, 4, 5$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = 6$, none when $k = 7$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq 8$.

* If $n = 8$, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which $16$ are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, uncountably many (related to the $2$-dimensional decompositions, and of which $1680$ are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 1$, none when $k = 2, 3$, uncountably many (related to the octonions) when $k = 4$, none when $k = 5, 6$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = 7$, none when $k = 8$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq 9$.

* If $n \geq 9$ is odd, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which $2n$ are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, none when $1 \leq k \lt n - 1$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = n - 1$, none when $k = n$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq n + 1$.

* If $n \geq 10$ is even, then there are uncountably many cross products (one for each unit vector, of which $2n$ are compatible with a given basis) when $k = 0$, uncountably many (related to the $2$-dimensional decompositions, and of which $2^{n/2}(n-1)!!$ are compatible with a given orientation) when $k = 1$, none when $2 \leq k \lt n - 1$, two (one for each orientation) when $k = n - 1$, none when $k = n$, and one (always zero) when $k \geq n + 1$.


### Tensor-valued {#tensorvalued}

Fixing a field $K$, let [[Vect]] be $Vect_K$, the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of vector spaces over $K$ (with the usual [[tensor product]]), and let $T$ be any [[symmetric monoidal functor]] from $Vect$ to itself.  Note that any inner product $g\colon V \otimes V \to K$ extends to a (possibly degenerate) inner product $T(g)\colon T(V) \otimes T(V) \to K$; similarly, any element $x$ of $V$, thought of as a linear map $x\colon K \to V$, gives rise to an element $T(x)$ of $T(V)$.  The vector-valued cross products [above](#vectorvalued) use the [[identity functor]] for $T$, but other possible choices for $T$ are $V \mapsto V \otimes V$, $V \mapsto \Lambda^2 V$, and the constant functor $V \mapsto K$.  We could also take $Vect$ to be a [[full subcategory]] of $Vect_K$ closed under the tensor product, such as $Fin Vect_K$; this may allow more possibilities for $T$ in exchange for fewer possibilities for $V$.

Given an inner-product space $V$ and a symmetric monoidal functor $T$, a __$T$-valued cross product__ on $V$ is a multilinear function
$$ &#10761;\colon V^k \to T(V) $$
for some natural arity $k$ such that:

1. Alternation: $&#10761;(v_1,\ldots,v_k) = 0$ if $v_i = v_j$ for some $i \ne j$.

2. Orthogonality: $&#10761;(v_1,\ldots,v_k)$ is orthogonal (in $T(V)$) to each $T(v_i)$.

3. Area: ${\|&#10761;(v_1,\ldots,v_k)\|} = \prod_i {\|v_i\|}$ if the $v_i$ are mutually orthogonal (in $V$).

Again it follows that in any case ${\|&#10761;(v_1,\ldots,v_k)\|}$ is a square root of the Gram determinant, and again this implies both (1) and (3).

I do not know a full list of these, but one important example is the __scalar-valued binary cross product__ in $2$ dimensions:
$$ (a, b) \times (c, d) = a d - b c .$$
Actually, this scalar-valued cross product $x \times y$ is simply the dot product $x \cdot {\times}y$, where ${\times}y$ is the [unary](#counary) cross product in $2$ dimensions.

More generally, in any number $n \geq 2$ of dimensions, there is a __multivector-valued binary cross product__ (actually one for each orientation) whose values are $(n-2)$-[[multivector|vectors]]; this includes the scalar-valued cross product when $n = 2$ and the classical cross product when $n = 3$, but gets more complicated for larger values of $n$.  In particular, for $n = 4$, we have a [[bivector]]-valued cross product, which is the [[Hodge dual]] of the [[exterior product]].

Or generalizing the scalar-valued binary cross product in a different way, the [[volume]] form on an $n$-dimensional inner-product space is a __scalar-valued co-nullary cross product__ (so $n$-ary).  Notice that there are two of these, one for each orientation, and each of these is the dot product with one of the vector-valued $(n-1)$-ary cross products.  There are no other scalar-valued cross products, except for the identically zero products of arity $k \gt n$ and the two nullary products given by the unit-norm scalars (so just $1$ and $-1$ over the real numbers) for arbitrary $n$.


## Relationships

### Exterior products

The cross product is also called 'outer product', and both of these terms are sometimes also used for the [[exterior product]].  In its most basic form, the exterior product of two vectors $u,v$ is a [[bivector]] $u \wedge v$.  But note that this is *not* a bivector-valued cross product by the definition [above](#tensorvalued), since it lacks orthogonality (and indeed has nothing to do with the inner product).

In $3$ dimensions, given an inner product and an orientation, we can use the [[Hodge dual]] to turn the exterior product into a vector, and this is the classical cross product once more.  In $2$ dimensions, using the same structure, we can turn the bivector into a [[scalar]]; this recovers the scalar-valued binary cross product [above](#tensorvalued).  In general, this produces the binary $(n-2)$-vector-valued cross product.

Using only the inner product but not the orientation, we get (respectively) a [[pseudovector]] (sometimes called an axial vector) or more generally a [[pseudoscalar]] or other [[pseudotensor]]; this perspective is common in [[geometric algebra]].  In general in dimension $n$, a bivector becomes an $(n-2)$-pseudovector, but this is not usually a simplification.

In classical applications of the cross product, often not all of the structure is needed, and the exterior product is really the fundamental concept.


### Curls

If $M$ is a [[Riemannian manifold]], then the [[tangent space]] at each point is an [[inner product space]], so it may be possible to smoothly assign a $k$-ary cross product to these spaces.  If this is done, then we can take the [[curl]] of a $(k-1)$-[[multivector|vector]] [[vector field|field]] as follows:

*  Use the metric to turn the $(k-1)$-vector field into a $(k-1)$-[[differential form|form]].
*  Take the [[exterior differential]] to get a $k$-form.
*  Use the metric again to get a $k$-vector field.
*  Apply the cross product to get a [[vector field]] (or more generally a [[tensor field]] for a tensor-valued cross product).

This vector field is the __curl__ of the original $(k-1)$-vector field.  This justifies the notation $\Del \times X$ for the curl.

(It\'s important that the cross product is [[alternating form|alternating]] and [[multilinear map|multilinear]], so that it makes sense to apply it to a $k$-vector rather than to $k$ individual vectors.)

When $k = 2$ and $n = 3$, there is one smooth choice of cross product for each [[orientation]] of $M$, and we recover the classical notion of curl.

When $k = 1$ and $n = 2$, we may also consider the scalar-valued curl, using the scalar-valued binary cross product described [above](#tensorvalued).  The scalar-valued curl of a vector field $X$ is the same as the [[divergence]] of the rotated vector field ${\times}X$ (using the [unary](#counary) cross product in $2$ dimensions); that is, $\Del \times X = \Del \cdot {\times}X$.

In modern mathematics, of course, we usually think of the exterior differential of differential forms as the fundamental concept, and only turn these forms into vector fields and the like under certain circumstances.

## Idea

An __affine space__ or __affine linear space__ is a [[vector space]] that has forgotten its origin.  An __affine linear map__ (a morphism of affine spaces) is a linear map (a morphism of vector spaces) that need not preserve the origin.

Note that the 'linear functions' of elementary algebra ---the total functions whose graphs are lines--- are in fact (precisely) *affine* $\mathbb{R}$-linear maps from $\mathbb{R}$ to itself.  (Similarly, the 'linear relations' ---the relations whose graphs are lines--- are precisely the *[[projective space|projective]]* $\mathbb{R}$-linear maps.) 

Alternatively, in [[algebraic geometry]], the terminology "$n$-dimensional affine space" $\mathbb{A}^n k$ (affine line, affine plane, etc.) over a [[field]] $k$ refers to, depending on context, the set $k^n$, or the set of maximal ideals of the [[polynomial algebra]] $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ -- these definitions coinciding if $k$ is an [[algebraically closed field]] -- and typically considered as equipped with relevant extra structure such as a [[Zariski topology]] or, going even further, the [[locally ringed space]] structure adhering to the [[affine variety]] or [[affine scheme]] corresponding to the polynomial algebra $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$. Whatever the precise sense chosen, the idea is that an affine space $\mathbb{A}^n k$ is a setting in which the study of loci of polynomial equations, i.e. definable sets in the theory of [[commutative algebras]] over $k$, is carried out. 

Most of this article concerns affine spaces in the sense of vector spaces that have forgotten their origins or identities; the algebraic geometry sense is very briefly touched upon in the section *Affine spaces as model spaces*. 


## Definitions

### Summary

The definition of affine space can be made precise in various (equivalent) ways.  We give a name to some of the definitions for later reference.

*  An affine space is simply a vector space, but with different morphisms; an affine linear map is a function that is the difference between a linear map and a [[constant function]].

*  An affine space is a [[set]] equipped with an equivalence class of vector space structures, where two vector space structures are considered equivalent if the [[identity function]] is affine linear as a map from one structure to the other; whether a map between affine spaces is affine linear is independent of the representative vector space structures.

*  An affine space is a set $A$ together with a vector space $V$ and an [[action]] of (the additive group or _[[translation group]]_ of) $V$ on $A$ that makes $A$ into a $V$-[[torsor]] (over the point); an affine linear map is a $V$-equivariant map. For this point of view, see also [[zoranskoda:affine space]].

*  An affine space is a [[heap]] whose [[automorphism group]] is equipped with structure making it the additive group of a vector space; an affine linear map is a heap morphism.

*  An affine space is an [[inhabited set]] $A$ together with a vector space $V$ and a function $\Lambda\colon A \times A \to V$ (thought of $\Lambda(x,y) \coloneqq x - y$) that satisfies some equations; an affine linear map $A \to A'$ is a function equipped with a linear map $V \to V'$ relative to which it preserves subtraction (the "vector-valued difference" definition).

*  An affine space over the [[ground field]] $k$ is an [[inhabited set]] $A$ together with functions $\mu\colon A \times A \times A \to A$ (thought of as $\mu(x,y,z) \coloneqq x - y + z$) and $\Lambda_*\colon k \times A \times A \to A$ (thought of as $\Lambda_r(x,y) \coloneqq x - r x + r y$) that satisfy some equations; an affine linear map is a function that preserves these operations (the "two ternary operations" definition).

*  An affine space over $k$ is an inhabited set $A$ together with a function $\mu_*\colon k\times A\times A\times A\to A$ (thought of as $\mu_r(x,y,z) \coloneqq r x - r y + z$) that satisfies some equations; an affine linear map is a function that preserves this operation (the "one quaternary operation") definition.

*  Assuming that $2$ is invertible in the field $k$ (i.e. the [[characteristic]] of $k$ is not $2$), an affine space over $k$ is an inhabited set $A$ together with a function $\Lambda_*\colon k \times A \times A \to A$ that satisfies some equations; an affine linear map is a function that preserves this operation (the "one ternary operation" definition).

*  An affine space over the field $k$ is an inhabited set $A$ together with, for every [[natural number]] $n \geq 0$ and every $(n+1)$-tuple $(r_0,\dots,r_n)$ of elements of $k$ such that $r_0 + \dots + r_n = 1$, a function $\gamma_{r_0,\ldots,r_n}\colon A^{n+1}\to A$ (thought of as $\gamma_{r_0,\ldots,r_n}(x_0,\ldots,x_n) \coloneqq r_0 x_0 + \cdots + r_n x_n$), satisfying some equations; an affine linear map is a function that preserves these operations (the "[[unbiased]]" definition).

* An affine space over the field $k$ is a vector space $A'$ together with a surjective linear map $\pi:A'\to k$ (the "slice of $Vect$" definition).  The affine space itself (the set being regarded as equipped with affine-space structure) is the fiber $\pi^{-1}(1)$.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I think there should also be a definition of the form "an affine space is a [[projective space]]" with a distinguished line called "infinity", which should also be equivalent to a "synthetic" description involving points and lines and incidence axioms.  This definition would not fix the field $k$ at the outset, but rather recover it synthetically using cross-ratios.  Accordingly, it ought to define an equivalent groupoid to the groupoid of pairs $(k,A)$ where $k$ is a field and $A$ is an affine space over $A$.  I don't know how one could recover the non-invertible affine transformations from it directly.

There should be another characterisation, which I don\'t quite see how to phrase, at least when $k = \mathbb{R}$, which is that an affine space is a manifold (perhaps Riemannian) that is sufficiently flat and unbounded in some sense.  ---Toby

[[Mike Shulman]]: It'd have to be at least Riemannian, otherwise you don't have enough structure.  I don't suppose it's enough to say that a (finitely generated) affine space is a Riemannian manifold isometric to some $\mathbb{R}^n$?

_Toby_:  I intended 'that is [...] in some sense' to include the possibility of structure that should be preserved by the morphisms.  Note that a Riemannian manifold is *too much* structure, although it allows a definition like the first one above.  (A Riemannian manifold isometric to some $\mathbb{R}^n$ is precisely a [[Euclidean space]].)  But really, I\'m hoping for some phrasing such that &#8249;isomorphic to some $\mathbb{R}^n$&#8250; actually becomes a (not too obvious) *theorem*.  I\'ll keep thinking about it.

[[Mike Shulman]]: Shouldn't a Riemannian manifold isometric to some $\mathbb{R}^n$ be a "Euclidean affine space" (a torsor over a Euclidean space)?  Seems that a Euclidean space would be a Riemannian manifold _equipped with_ an isometry to some $\mathbb{R}^n$.  It does seem like there should be a natural way to say this, but I don't know what it is.

_Toby_:  I guess that this depends on what you think 'Euclidean space' means; I\'ve known people to define it to *be* $\mathbb{R}^n$, but that seems quite ahistorical to me; I like that Urs calls such a thing [[Cartesian space]] instead.  Euclid did not have coordinates; he did not even have an origin, so a Euclidean space should be a heap rather than a group.  For my comment above, I would define a [[Euclidean space]] to be an affine inner product space; FWIW [Wikipedia agrees](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/affine_space).  (However, Wikipedia doesn\'t go as far as I do when I claim that the inner product should be valued in an $\mathbb{R}$-line rather than in $\mathbb{R}$ itself; then again, I ignored that subtlety myself in my previous comment.)
=--

Clearly every vector space has an underlying affine space (and every linear map is affine linear), giving a [[forgetful functor]] $U:Vect \to Aff$.  Conversely, any affine space gives rise to a canonical vector space, sometimes called its space of _displacements_.  This is obvious from the definitions that involve a vector space as part of the structure, but a vector space can also be reconstructed from the other definitions as well, analogously to how a group can be reconstructed from a [[heap]].  This gives a functor $D:Aff\to Vect$ in the other direction.  One can verify that $D(U(V))\cong V$ and $U(D(A))\cong A$; the first isomorphism is [[natural isomorphism|natural]], but the second is not (otherwise $Vect$ and $Aff$ would be [[equivalent categories]], which they are not).

The category of affine spaces is almost a [[variety of algebras]], as can be seen from the last few definitions, except for the requirement that an affine space be inhabited.  To rectify this, sometimes one allows the [[empty set]] to be an affine space, although it does not have any particular vector space of displacements.  (See [heap#empty](heap#empty) for discussion.)

Note that there are a few different ways to think about the operations involved in the final three definitions (those not explicitly involving a vector space).  The operation $\mu\colon x,y,z \mapsto x - y + z$ is the same as the [[Mal'cev operation]] (i.e. [[heap]] structure) of the [[translation group|additive group]] of a vector space.  It can be viewed as the point completing a parallelogram with given vertices $x,y,z$, or equivalently as the result of adding $x$ and $z$, relative to a choice of $y$ as the origin.  The operation $\Lambda_*\colon r,x,y \mapsto x - r x + r y$ can be viewed as either a weighted average of $x$ and $y$ (i.e. as $(1-r)x + r y$) or as the result of multiplying the "displacement vector" $y-x$ by $r$, relative to the origin $x$ (i.e. as $x + r(y-x)$).


### Details and comparisons

The first few definitions, which explicitly involve a vector space, make no especial use of the fact that the vector space is a vector space rather than merely an abelian [[group]].  Thus, they are valid (and equivalent) in the more general context of [[torsors]] and [[heaps]].  They are also mostly complete as stated, except for the final one.


#### Vector-valued differences

In this definition, an affine space over a vector space $V$ is a set $A$ together with a "subtraction" function $\Lambda\colon A\times A\to V$, written $\Lambda\colon x,y \mapsto x-y$, such that:

* $\Lambda(x,x) = 0$, or $x-x = 0$, for any $x$ in $A$.
* $\Lambda(x,y) + \Lambda(y,z) = \Lambda(x,z)$, or $(x-y) + (y-z) = (x-z)$, for any $x,y,z$ in $A$.
* For any $x$ in $A$ and $v$ in $V$ there exists a unique $y$ in $A$ such that $\Lambda(y,x) = v$, or $y - x = v$.

If $y - x = v$, then we write $y = x + v$, which we can regard as an operation on $x$ and $v$ by the third axiom.  Hence we have $(x + v) - x = v$ and (by uniqueness) $x + (y - x) = y$, and also $x + 0 = x$ and $(x + v) + w = x + (v + w)$ by the first two axioms.  Thus, these axioms suffice to make $A$ into a [[torsor]] over the additive group of $V$ with the action $+$, which is one of the previous definitions given.

Note again that this would makes sense if $V$ is any group, not just the additive group of a vector space.


#### Two ternary operations

This definition is an affine version of the usual definition of a vector space in terms of addition and scalar multiplication.  However, in each case the affine operation needs to take an extra parameter.  In reading the following axioms it helps to think of $\mu(x,y,z)$ as "the sum of $x$ and $z$ relative to the basepoint $y$" and likewise $\Lambda_r(x,y)$ as "the product $r\cdot y$ relative to the basepoint $x$".

* $\mu(x,x,y) = y$ (identity for addition)
* $\mu(x,y,\mu(z,w,v)) = \mu(\mu(x,y,z),w,v)$ (associativity of addition)
* $\mu(x,y,z) = \mu(z,y,x)$ (commutativity of addition)
* $\Lambda_{r s}(x,y) = \Lambda_r(x, \Lambda_s(x,y))$ (associativity of scalar multiplication)
* $\Lambda_1(x,y) = y$ (identity for scalar multiplication)
* $\Lambda_0(x,y) = x$ (left zero for scalar multiplication)
* $\Lambda_{r+s}(x,y) = \mu(\Lambda_r(x,y), x, \Lambda_s(x,y))$ (left distributivity of scalar multiplication)
* $\Lambda_r(w, \mu(x,y,z)) = \mu(\Lambda_r(w,x), \Lambda_r(w,y), \Lambda_r(w,z))$ (right distributivity of scalar multiplication)

_Joost_: Could it be that there is an axiom missing here ? One can go from Vector spaces to the 2 ternary operations definition and back, but I can't see that by starting with the two ternary operations definition, going to vectorspaces and back, you get the same $\Lambda$. I guess you need an extra axiom as $\mu(x,y,\Lambda_r(y,z))=\Lambda_r(x,\mu(x,y,z))$.

_Toby_:  Conceptually, there is something missing, which I\'ve inserted as the left zero property of scalar multiplication.  (The right zero property $\Lambda_r(x,x) = x$ follows from this using associativity of scalar multiplication with $s = 0$, same as with vector spaces.)  But I have to leave, and I haven\'t yet derived your axiom, even with this aid.

=--

#### One quaternary operation

This definition is an affine version of the less standard definition of a vector space in terms of a single operation $r,x,y\mapsto r\cdot x + y$.  Here an affine space over $k$ is a set $A$ together with a single operation $\mu\colon k\times A\times A\times A\to A$, written as $(r,x,y,z)\mapsto \mu_r(x,y,z)$ and thought of as the sum "$r\cdot x + z$ relative to the basepoint $y$," such that:

* $\mu_1(x,y,y) = x$
* $\mu_r(x,x,y) = y$
* $\mu_1(x,y,z) = \mu_1(z,y,x)$
* $\mu_r(\mu_s(x,y,z),w,v) = \mu_{r s}(x,y,\mu_r(z,w,v))$
* $\mu_{r+s}(x,y,z) = \mu_r(x,y,\mu_s(x,y,z))$


#### One ternary operation

In the affine case (in contrast to the vector space case), it turns out that if $2$ is invertible the "addition" $(x,y,z)\mapsto x-y+z$ can be recovered from the "scalar multiplication" $(r,x,y)\mapsto r x + (1-r)y$ by $\mu(x,y,z) = \Lambda_2(y,\Lambda_{1/2}(x,z))$.  Thus, in this case we can define an affine space over $k$ to be a set $A$ together with a single operation $\Lambda\colon k\times A\times A\to A$ such that the axioms for the two-ternary-operations definition are satisfied with this definition of $\mu$.

However, we can also simplify the requisite axioms in this presentation.  The following axioms are easier to state if we write $\Lambda_r(x,y)$ as $(1-r) x + r y$, or equivalently as $r x + s y$, where we require $r+s=1$ for the expression to be defined.

* Idempotence: $r x + s x = x$ whenever $r+s=1$.
* Commutativity: $r x + s y = s y + r x$ whenever $r+s=1$.
* Associativity: whenever $r+s+t=1$, whichever of the following three expressions are defined are equal:
  $$
  \array{
  r x + (1-r)\left(\frac{s}{1-r} y + \frac{t}{1-r} z\right)\\
  (1-s)\left(\frac{r}{1-s} x + \frac{t}{1-s} z\right) + s y\\
  (1-t)\left(\frac{r}{1-t} x + \frac{s}{1-t} y\right) + t z
  }
  $$
  The first is defined whenever $r\neq 1$, the second whenever $s\neq 1$, and the third whenever $t\neq 1$.  Since $k$ has characteristic $\neq 2$, we cannot have $r=s=t=1$ and $r+s+t=1$ at the same time, so at least one of these expressions is always defined.  We write $r x + s y + t z$ for the common value of whichever of them are defined.
* Cancellation: for any $r\in k$ and $x,y\in A$, we have $x + r y - r y = x$.


#### Unbiased definition

Let $Th_{vect}$ denote the [[Lawvere theory]] of $k$-vector spaces.  For any $n$, its $n$-ary operations are $n$-tuples $(r_1,\dots,r_n)\in k^n$ representing the [[linear combination]] operation $(x_1,\dots,x_n)\mapsto r_1 x_1 +\dots+ r_n x_n$.  Composition of operations is by substitution in the obvious way, and the identity operation is $(1)$.  A model of this theory is simply a vector space.  With this 'unbiased' definition, a vector space comes equipped with, for every integer $n\ge 0$ and $n$-tuple $(r_1,\dots,r_n)$ of elements of $k$, a function $V^n\to V$ (thought of as $(v_1,\dots,v_n)\mapsto r_1 v_1+\dots r_n v_n$), satisfying some axioms.

Let $Th_{aff}$ denote the subtheory of $Th_{vect}$ containing only those operations $(r_1,\dots,r_n)$ such that $r_1+\dots+r_n=1$; an **affine space** is a nonempty model of $Th_{aff}$.  (We have to observe that these are closed under the theory operations and thus define a subtheory.  Note that this excludes all zero-ary operations, so an affine space has no distinguished constants, and it also excludes all nonidentity unary operations.)  The basic operations $r_0x_0+\dots+r_n x_n$, when $r_0+\dots+r_n=1$, are called __affine (linear) combinations__ of elements of $A$.

The axioms for the unbiased definition are most straightforward to see by writing out the operations of $Th_{aff}$.  In particular, this includes "substitution" axioms of the form
$$
r_0(s_{00} x_{00} + \dots + s_{0m_0} x_{0m_0}) + \dots + r_n (s_{n0} x_{n0} + \dots + s_{n m_n} x_{n m_n}) = r_0 s_{00} x_{00} + \dots + r_n s_{n m_n} x_{n m_n}.
$$
However, it also includes "permutation" axioms of the form
$$
r_0 x_0 + \dots + r_n x_n = r_{\sigma 0} x_{\sigma 0} + \dots + r_{\sigma n} x_{\sigma n}
$$
and also "duplication" and "omission" axioms.  This Lawvere theory can be defined concisely as follows.  The Lawvere theory of vector spaces is the opposite of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces; its operations are all [[linear combinations]].  The Lawvere theory for affine spaces is the sub-theory of this consisting of only the affine combinations.  (The Lawvere theory of vector spaces also has other interesting sub-theories, such as that consisting of _[[convex combinations]]_ whose algebras are abstract [[convex space]]s in one sense of the term.)  Note that the empty set is a model (algebra) of this Lawvere theory; an affine space is an *inhabited* model.

Given the unbiased definition in terms of a Lawvere theory, the previous three "biased" vector-space-free definitions can then be recovered by finding particular generating operations for the theory.  In particular, this Lawvere theory is generated by $2$-ary operations if $char(k)\neq 2$, and by $3$-ary ones if $char(k)=2$.  To wit, suppose given $(r_0,\dots,r_n)\in k^{n+1}$ with $n\ge 3$ such that $r_0+\dots+r_n=1$.  Suppose for the moment that the $r_i$ are not all $1$, and WLOG suppose that $r_0\neq 1$.  (Note that here we use the invariance under permutations.)  Then we have
$$
r_0 x_0 + \dots + r_n x_n = r_0 x_0 + (1-r_0)\left(\frac{1}{1-r_0} r_1 x_1 + \dots + \frac{1}{1-r_0}r_n x_n\right)
$$
so we have expressed the given $(n+1)$-ary operation in terms of a $2$-ary one and an $n$-ary one.  By induction, in this way we can express any $(n+1)$-ary operation in terms of $2$-ary ones (note that there is only one $1$-ary operation, namely the identity, and no $0$-ary ones) --- as long as we never hit a tuple where every $r_i=1$.  But since we always have the requirement $r_0+\dots+r_n=1$, this badness can only happen if the characteristic of $k$ is $n$.  Moreover, we still have
$$
x_0 + \dots + x_n = x_0 - x_1 + (2x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n)
$$
so we can still write this $(n+1)$-ary operation in terms of a $3$-ary one and an $n$-ary one.  So only if $n+1=3$ (i.e. $n=char(k)=2$) are we prevented from getting down to $2$-ary operations only, and in this case we can still get down to $3$-ary ones.  Finally, we observe that any $3$-ary operation can be written in terms of $2$-ary ones and the particular $3$-ary operation $x_0 - x_1 + x_2$:
$$
r_0 x_0 + r_1 x_1 + r_2 x_2 = \big(r_0 x_0 + (1-r_0) x_2\big) - x_2 + \big(r_1 x_1 + (1-r_1) x_2\big).
$$

#### Slice of $Vect$

Given an affine space $A$ (with any other definition), the corresponding $\pi:A'\to k$ is constructed as follows.  Let $A' = 1 \sqcup A$, where $\sqcup$ is the coproduct in affine spaces (akin to a simplicial [[join]]), $1$ is the [[terminal object|terminal]] affine space, and $\pi$ is the composite of $1 \sqcup !: 1 \sqcup A \to 1 \sqcup 1$ with a natural identification $\mu: 1 \sqcup 1 \cong k$.  Both $1 \sqcup !$ and $\mu$ which are morphisms of $Aff$ may be regarded as morphisms of $1 \downarrow Aff \simeq Vect$ (pointed affine spaces are vector spaces) if we let the first inclusion $i_0: 1 \to 1 \sqcup 1$ be the pointing of $1 \sqcup 1$ and $0: 1 \to k$ the pointing of $k$ and define $\mu$ by $\mu \circ i_0 = 0$, $\mu \circ i_1 = 1$ (the element $1 \in k$). (So $\mu$ is like two ends of a meter stick used to set up coordinates on the line $k$.)

Conversely, given $\pi:A'\to k$, the fiber $\pi^{-1}(1)$ naturally acquires a "vector-valued difference" affine space structure by simple subtraction in the vector space $A'$, where the vector space of displacements is $V = \pi^{-1}(0)$.

Note that this definition embeds the category $Aff$ of (inhabited) affine spaces fully-faithfully in the [[slice category]] $Vect/k$.  The objects of $Vect/k$ not in $Aff$ are those of the form $0:V\to k$, which form a category equivalent to $Vect$ itself.  Moreover, there are no morphisms from objects of $Aff$ to objects not in $Aff$; while by the above construction, a morphism from $0:V\to k$ to an affine space $\pi:A'\to k$ is just a map from $V$ to the vector space of displacements of $A$.  Hence, $Vect/k$ is equivalent to the (dual) [[cograph of a functor|cograph]] of $D:Aff\to Vect$.


### Closed monoidal structure 

If we allow affine spaces to be empty, then they are the models of an [[algebraic theory]] $Th_{Aff}$.  Moreover, like $Th_{Vect}$, the theory $Th_{Aff}$ is a [[commutative theory]]. It follows that if $A, B$ are affine spaces, then the set $\hom(A, B)$ is closed under all affine space operations pointwise defined on the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$. This gives $Aff$ a [[closed category]] structure; on general grounds, it is in fact a [[symmetric monoidal closed category]]. The unit of this structure is the terminal or one-pointed affine space $1$, via the natural isomorphism $\hom(1, B) \cong B$. Thus $Aff$ is a closed [[semicartesian monoidal category]]. 

Analogous to the case of $Vect$, every affine space is a coproduct of copies of the monoidal unit: an affine space $A$ of dimension $n$ admits an affine basis, which amounts to an isomorphism $1 \sqcup 1 \sqcup \ldots \sqcup 1 \cong A$, represented by $n+1$ [*sic*] points of $A$. Such basis representations allow one to coordinatize spaces of maps $\hom(A, B) \cong B^{n+1}$, with dimension $(n+1)\dim(B)$. If one uses the first of the affine basis elements to give a pointing of the affine space (equivalent to a vector space structure), then the remaining affine basis elements provide a vector space basis, and in those coordinates every element $f \in \hom(A, B)$ may be written in matrix-vector form $f(x) = M x + b$, where again the space of such $(M, b)$ has dimension $m n + m$ if $m$ is the dimension of $B$. (There are also more 'unbiased' coordinate descriptions, not biased in favor of the first basis element playing the role of the origin.) 

Similarly, we can coordinatize affine tensor products $A \otimes B$: the tensor distributes over coproducts (as it does in any symmetric monoidal closed category) and so 

$$(\bigsqcup_{n+1} 1) \otimes (\bigsqcup_{m+1} 1) \cong \bigsqcup_{(m+1)(n+1)} 1 \otimes 1 \cong \bigsqcup_{(m+1)(n+1)} 1$$ 

with dimension $m n + m + n$. In other words, if $a_1, \ldots, a_{n+1}$ is an affine basis of $n$-dimensional $A$ and $b_1, \ldots, b_{m+1}$ a basis of $m$-dimensional $B$, then $A \otimes B$ has an affine basis consisting of the $m n + m + n + 1$ many elements $a_i \otimes b_j$. 

The embedding $Aff \to Vect/k$ described in the previous subsection, sending $A$ to $1 \sqcup !: 1 \sqcup A \to 1 \sqcup 1$, is a [[strong monoidal functor]] (preserves the tensor product up to coherent isomorphism) if $Vect/k$ is endowed with the obvious tensor product acquired from $Vect$. Note that $Vect/k$ is the coreflection of $Vect$ from monoidal categories to [[semicartesian monoidal categories]]; the embedding $Aff \to Vect/k$ was in fact discovered by one of us in conjunction with this fact, and is the same as the functor induced by universality from the strong monoidal functor $Aff \to Vect$ given by $A \mapsto 1 \sqcup A$. 

## Further Remarks

Every finitely-generated affine space is isomorphic to the $n$-fold [[direct sum]] $k^n$, where $k$ is the [[base field]] and $n$ is a [[natural number]] (possibly $0$).  In [[algebraic geometry]], an $n$-dimensional affine space is often denoted $\mathbb{A}^n$ and identified with $k^n$.  If one accepts the empty set as an affine space, then this is considered to have dimension $-1$ by convention (so $k^{-1} = \empty$).

The notion of affine space may be generalised to __affine module__ by replacing the vector space above by a [[module]] and the base field $k$ by a [[commutative ring]].  Then an affine module over the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integer]]s is precisely a commutative [[heap]], just like a module over $\mathbb{Z}$ is an [[abelian group]].  Note that the definition involving only one "scalar multiplication" operation works if and only if $2$ is invertible in $k$; it\'s not enough that $2 \ne 0$ in $k$.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I haven't thought much about affine modules, but it seems likely to me that the "biased" module-free definitions won't be right any more, since the Lawvere theory needn't be generated by 2-ary or 3-ary operations (as far as I can see).  More explicitly, I don't immediately see how to write an operation like
$$(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3) \mapsto 4x_0 - 6x_1 - 2x_2 + 5x_3$$
in terms of $A^3\to A$ and $\mathbb{Z}\times A^2\to A$, but it seems to me that this operation should still exist in an affine $\mathbb{Z}$-module.

[[Mike Shulman]]: Well that's rubbish isn't it.  The operation $A^3\to A$ is enough to give you a heap, hence an additive group, and then $\mathbb{Z}\times A^2\to A$ gives you the scalar multiplication.  And so
$$4x_0 - 6x_1 - 2x_2 + 5x_3 = \big((4x_0 - 3y) - y + (-6x_1+7y)\big) - y + \big((-2x_2+3y) - y + (5x_3 - 4y)\big)$$
for any $y$ at all.

_Toby_:  Right.  But I find an affine module of a *rig* to be a trickier concept.

[[Mike Shulman]]: Quite so.  Perhaps first one should look for a version of a [[heap]] corresponding to a [[monoid]]?

_Toby_:  Yes, that would be an affine $\mathbb{N}$-module.

## Affine spaces as model spaces

Affine spaces typically serve as local models for more general kinds of spaces. 

For instance a [[manifold]] is a [[topological space]] that is locally isomorphic to an affine space over the [[real numbers]].  

Similarly, in [[algebraic geometry]] a [[scheme]] is locally isomorphic to an [[affine scheme]].

Therefore there are attempts to axiomatize properties of categories of affine spaces for the purpose of using these as model spaces for more complicated geometries. One such axiomatization is the notion of [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]]. and in particular that of [pregeometry](/nlab/show/geometry+(for+structured+(infinity%2C1%29-toposes%29#Pregeometry).

## Idea 

A _real number_ is a [[number]] that may be [[Dedekind completion|approximated]] by [[rational numbers]].  Equipped with the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] induced from the rational numbers, real numbers form a _[[field]]_, commonly denoted _$\mathbb{R}$_. The underlying set is the _[[Dedekind completion|completion]]_ of the [[ordered field]] $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers: the result of adjoining to $\mathbb{Q}$ [[suprema]] for every [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[bounded set|bounded subset]] with respect to the natural [[order|ordering]] of rational numbers.

The [[set]] of real numbers also carries naturally the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of a [[topological space]] and as such $\mathbb{R}$ is called the  _[[real line]]_ also known as _[[continuum|the continuum]]_. Equipped with both the topology and the field structure, $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[topological field]] and as such is the [[complete space|uniform completion]] of $\mathbb{Q}$ equipped with the [[absolute value]] [[metric space|metric]].

Together with its [[cartesian products]] -- the [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ for [[natural numbers]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ -- the real line $\mathbb{R}$ is a standard formalization of the idea of _continuous space_.  The more general concept of ([[smooth manifold|smooth]]) _[[manifold]]_ is modeled on these Cartesian spaces. These, in turn are standard models for the notion of [[space]] in particular in [[physics]] (see _[[spacetime]]_), or at least in [[classical physics]]. See at _[[geometry of physics]]_ for more on this.


## History

The original idea of a real number came from [[geometry]]; one thinks of a real number as specifying a _point on a line_, with _[[line]]_ understood as the abstract idea of the object that a pencil and a ruler draw on a piece of paper.  (More precisely, given two distinct points on the line, called $0$ and $1$, you get a [[bijection]] between the points and the real numbers.)

[[Euclid]] (citing [[Eudoxus]]) dealt with ratios of geometric magnitudes, which give positive real numbers; an arbitrary real number is then a difference of ratios of magnitudes.  However, the Greeks did not think of such ratios as [[number]]s; that appears to have been an insight of the Arabs.  See more at [[Eudoxus real number]]. 

A big project of the 19th century (at least in hindsight) was the 'arithmetisation of analysis': showing how real numbers could be defined completely in terms of rational numbers (and the desired classes of functions on them could be defined in terms of the general point-set notion of [[function]]).  Two successful approaches were developed in 1872, [[Richard Dedekind]]\'s definition of real numbers as certain sets of rational numbers (called _[[Dedekind cuts]]_) and [[Georg Cantor]]\'s definition as certain sequences of rational numbers (called _[[Cauchy sequences]]_).

A more modern approach is instead to characterise the properties that the set of real numbers must have and to prove that this is [[generalized the|categorical]] (unique up to a unique bijection preserving those properties).  Then the important result of the 19th-century programme is simply that this is consistent (that there exists at least one such set).  One can even use [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]\'s or [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]\'s axioms for geometry to do this characterisation, coming full circle back to geometry.

Exactly how to define or characterise real numbers is still important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[topos theory]] with its [[internal logic]].  For more on this, see [[real numbers object]] and the examples below.


## Definitions and characterizations

There are two basic approaches possible: to define what a __real number__ is as a mathematical object, or to define the __real line__ as a specific object in some previously known [[category]].

### Dedekind cuts {#Dedekind}

Consider two [[inhabited set|inhabited]] subsets, $L$ and $U$, of a [[countable set|countable]] unbounded [[dense linear order]], such as $\mathbb{Q}$ (the set of [[rational numbers]]) or  $\mathbb{Z}[1/10]$ (the set of [[decimal fractions]]), such that:

*  If $a \in L$, then $b \in L$ for some $b \gt a$.
*  If $b \in U$, then $a \in U$ for some $a \lt b$.
*  If $a \lt b$ are rational numbers, then $a \in L$ or $b \in U$.  (\*)
*  If $a \in L$ and $b \in U$, then $a \lt b$.

We may define a __Dedekind real number__ to be such a pair, which is also called a __[[Dedekind cut]]__.

If $x \coloneqq (L,U)$ is a Dedekind cut, then we write $a \lt x$ to mean that $a \in L$ and $x \lt b$ to mean that $b \in U$.

We may approximate a Dedekind cut $x$ as closely as we like by applying (\*) as often as necessary.  This will be only finitely often, for any fixed positive level of approximation, given initial upper and lower bounds (which exist since $L$ and $U$ are inhabited).

See [[Dedekind completion]] for more.

### Cauchy sequences

Classically, a real number can be given by an [[infinite sequence|infinite]] [[Cauchy sequence]] of [[decimal fractions]] $\mathbb{Z}[1/10]$, each of which is a decimal fraction that approximates the real number to a given number of decimal places. However, many real numbers have several representations, i.e. 

  $$1/10 = 0.099999... = 0.10000...$$

so we need to specify an [[equivalence relation]] on the Cauchy sequences.  Thus, $\mathbb{R}$ is constructed as a [[subquotient]] of the [[function set]] $\mathbb{Z}[1/10]^{\mathbb{N}}$.

We can generalise this to any [[Cauchy sequence]] of rational numbers, and $\mathbb{R}$ is constructed as a [[subquotient]] of the [[function set]] $\mathbb{Q}^{\mathbb{N}}$.

This construction is equivalent to the construction by Dedekind cuts, at least assuming [[weak countable choice]] (which also follows from [[excluded middle]]).  Thus it is popular in both [[classical mathematics]] and traditional [[constructive mathematics]] (which accepts [[countable choice]]).  However, in stricter forms of constructive mathematics, including those used as [[internal languages]] in [[topos theory]], the Cauchy reals and Dedekind reals are not equivalent.  (On the other hand, by generalising to Cauchy [[nets]], we recover the Dedekind reals again.)

See [[Cauchy real number]] and [[generalized Cauchy real number]] for more.

### The initial sequentially modulated Cauchy complete archimedean field

There is an algebraic (more or less) characterisation of the real line as the 'initial sequentially modulated Cauchy complete archimedean field'.  This can be interpreted as follows:

*  A __field__ is well known in algebra; if it matters, we mean a [[Heyting field]].
*  An __ordered field__ means a *[[linear order|linearly]]* ordered field.
*  An __archimedean field__ is an ordered field satisfying the [[archimedean property]].
*  An archimedean field is __[[sequentially modulated Cauchy complete]]__ if all [[Cauchy sequences]] in the field with a $\mathbb{N}$-[[modulus of convergence]] [[converge]].
*  A sequentially modulated Cauchy complete archimedean field is __initial__ if it is an [[initial object]] in the category of sequentially modulated Cauchy complete archimedean fields.

The initial sequentially modulated Cauchy complete ordered field results in the [[HoTT book real numbers]]. 

### The Dedekind complete ordered field

There is a well-known algebraic (more or less) characterisation of the real line as the 'Dedekind complete ordered field', or sometimes the 'Dedekind complete archimedean field'.  This can be interpreted as follows:

*  A __field__ is well known in algebra; if it matters, we mean a [[Heyting field]].
*  An __ordered field__ means a *[[linear order|linearly]]* ordered field.
*  An __archimedean field__ is an ordered field satisfying the [[archimedean property]].
*  An ordered field is __Dedekind complete__ if it is [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]]:

1. For all elements $a \in F$, the upwards unbounded [[open interval]] $(a,\infty)$ is inhabited. 
2. For all elements $a \in F$, the downwards unbounded [[open interval]] $(-\infty,a)$ is inhabited.
3. For all elements $a \in F$ and $b \in F$, $a \lt b$ if and only if $(b,\infty)$ is a subinterval of $(a,\infty)$
4. For all elements $a \in F$ and $b \in F$, $b \lt a$ if and only if $(-\infty,b)$ is a subinterval of $(-\infty,a)$
5. For all elements $a \in F$ and $b \in F$, if $a \lt b$, then $F$ is a subinterval of the union of $(a, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, b)$
6. For all elements $a \in F$ and $b \in F$, the intersection of $(a,\infty)$ and $(-\infty,b)$ is a subinterval of $(a,b)$

In impredicative mathematics, we speak of [[the]] such field because it is unique up to unique [[isomorphism]].

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

Assuming impredicative foundations, there is an archimedean field $\mathbb{R}$ which is Dedekind-complete, and into which every archimedean field embeds.  Furthermore, every Dedekind-complete ordered field is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$, and uniquely so. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Construct $\mathbb{R}$ using, say, Dedekind cuts of rational numbers.  Then it is well known how to prove these facts about $\mathbb{R}$, so we omit the proof for now.
=--

However, we note that the proof is valid in weak [[foundations]], in particular internal to any [[topos]] with a [[natural numbers object]].  One can actually work in even weaker foundations than that; see the constructions at [[real numbers object]].  

Even weaker foundations are possible if one allows the [[underlying set]] of $\mathbb{R}$ to be [[proper class|large]]. 

However, if we are working in [[predicative mathematics]] with multiple [[universes]] in the foundation, the Dedekind real numbers would no longer be unique up to unique isomorphism, but rather there would be a set of Dedekind real numbers for each universe. 

### The Cauchy complete ordered field

There is a well-known algebraic (more or less) characterisation of the real line as the 'Cauchy complete ordered field', or sometimes the 'Cauchy complete archimedean field'.  This can be interpreted as follows:

*  A __field__ is well known in algebra; if it matters, we mean a [[Heyting field]].
*  An __ordered field__ means a *[[linear order|linearly]]* ordered field.
*  An __archimedean field__ is an ordered field satisfying the [[archimedean property]].
*  An ordered field is __[[complete space|Cauchy complete]]__ if every [[Cauchy net]] in the field [[converges]].

In impredicative mathematics, we speak of [[the]] such field because it is unique up to unique [[isomorphism]].

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

Assuming impredicative foundations, there is an archimedean field $\mathbb{R}$ which is Cauchy-complete, and into which every archimedean field embeds.  Furthermore, every Cauchy-complete ordered field is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$, and uniquely so.

However, if we are working in [[predicative mathematics]] with multiple [[universes]] in the foundation, the Cauchy real numbers would no longer be unique up to unique isomorphism, but rather there would be a set of Cauchy real numbers for each universe. 

### The terminal archimedean field

There is a well-known algebraic (more or less) characterisation of the real line as the 'terminal archimedean field' in a [[universe]].  This can be interpreted as follows:

*  A __field__ is well known in algebra; if it matters, we mean a [[Heyting field]].
*  An __ordered field__ means a *[[linear order|linearly]]* ordered field.
*  An __archimedean field__ is an ordered field satisfying the [[archimedean property]].
*  An archimedean field is __terminal in a universe__ if it is a [[terminal object]] in the category of archimedean fields of that universe.

In impredicative mathematics, we speak of [[the]] such field because it is unique up to unique [[isomorphism]] in a universe.

However, if we are working in [[predicative mathematics]] with multiple [[universes]] in the foundation, there is only a terminal archimedean field in a universe if there is a maximal universe term inside the universe into which all the other universe terms in that universe [[embedding|embed]] into. 

### As an archimedean Tarski group

There is a characterisation of the real line as the 'complete archimedean Tarski group' due to Alfred Tarski. This can be interpreted as follows:

*  An __abelian group__ is well known in algebra.
*  An __linearly ordered abelian group__ is an [[abelian group]] with a [[linear order]].
*  A __densely linearly ordered abelian group__ is an linearly ordered abelian group that is also a [[dense linear order]]. 
*  A __Tarski group__ is a densely linearly ordered abelian group with a point $1$ such that $1 \lt 1 + 1$.  
*  An __archimedean Tarski group__ is a [[Tarski group]] satisfying the [[archimedean property]].
*  An archimedean Tarski group is __complete__ if it is [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]]. 

See [[Tarski's axiomatization of the real numbers]] for more information. 

### The locale of real numbers

Consider [[binary relations]] $\sim$ on a [[countable]] [[inhabited]] [[dense linear order]] without endpoints, such as the [[rational numbers]], satisfying these four properties:

*  If $a \geq b$, then $a \sim b$.
*  If $a \geq b \sim c \geq d$, then $a \sim d$.
*  If $a \sim b \gt c \sim d$, then $a \sim d$.
*  If $b \sim c$ whenever $a \lt b$ and $c \lt d$, then $a \sim d$.

The collection of all such relations form a [[frame]], which we may interpret (by definition) as the __[[locale of real numbers]]__.  It can also be defined as the [[localic completion]] of the rational numbers.

We may then define a __localic real number__ to be a [[point of a locale|point]] of this locale.

This agrees with the notion of Dedekind real number, even in very weak ([[predicative mathematics|predicative]] and [[constructive mathematics|constructive]]) [[foundations]].

See [[locale of real numbers]] for more.

### Unit intervals

The [[coalgebra of the real interval|unit interval]] of the real numbers $[0,1]$ could be constructed as a [[terminal coalgebra of an endofunctor]] in the [[category]] of [[intervals]]. Let $(\mathbb{R},0,+,-,1,\cdot,\lt)$ be an [[ordered field]] where $0 \lt 1$, with a [[monotone]] $f:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$. The set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers is the initial such ordered field. 

See also: [[dyadic interval coalgebra]], [[decimal interval coalgebra]], [[rational interval coalgebra]]. 

### $\mathbb{R}^+$ as a terminal coalgebra

The positive real line $\mathbb{R}^+$ may be characterized as the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[coalgebra for an endofunctor]]

Let [[Pos]] be the [[category]] of [[poset]]s with a [[forgetful functor]]

$$ 
  U\colon Pos \to Set
$$

Consider the endofunctor

$$
  F_1\colon Pos \to Pos
$$

defined as the [[ordinal product]]

$$
  F_1\colon X \mapsto \omega \cdot X,
$$ 
for $\omega \in Pos$, where $\omega \cdot X$ is the [[cartesian product]] $U(\omega) \times U(X)$ with the [[lexicographic order]]. 

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The terminal coalgebra of $F_1$ is order isomorphic to the non-negative real line $\mathbb{R}^+$, with its standard order.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is theorem 5.1 in ([Pavlovic–Pratt 1999](#PavlovicPratt)).

There are many ways of setting up this description of $\mathbb{R}^+$, depending on the coalgebra structure $\mathbb{R}^+ \to \omega \cdot \mathbb{R}^+$ chosen. Here is one: there are evident poset isomorphisms $\mathbb{R}^+ \cong [1, \infty)$ and $\omega \cong \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2} = \{n \in \mathbb{N}: n \geq 2\}$. Define a map 

$$(\alpha, \beta): [1, \infty) \to \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2} \cdot [1, \infty)$$ 

where $\alpha(x)$ is the smallest integer strictly greater than $x$, and $\beta(x) = 1/(\alpha(x) - x)$. The stream of integers $a_n = \alpha(\beta^n(x))$ gives a [[continued fraction]] representation of $x$ in the form

$$x = a_0 - \frac1{a_1 - \frac1{a_2 - \ldots}},$$ 

and the resulting bijection $[1, \infty) \to \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2} \times \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2} \times \ldots$, sending $x$ to $(a_0, a_1, \ldots)$, is in fact a poset isomorphism if we endow the right-hand side with the lexicographic order. 
=-- 

Another way, which circumvents the use of isomorphisms $\mathbb{R}^+ \cong [1, \infty)$ and $\omega \cong \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$, is to define 

$$(\alpha, \beta): \mathbb{R}^+ \to \omega \cdot \mathbb{R}^+$$ 

where $\alpha(x)$ is the floor of $x$, and $\beta(x) = 1/(1 - x + \alpha(x)) - 1$. Then $a_n = \alpha(\beta^n(x))$ gives a [[continued fraction]] representation of $x$ in the form 

$$x = a_0 + \frac1{1 + \frac1{a_1 + \frac1{1 + \frac1{a_2 + \ldots}}}},$$ 
and the resulting [[bijection]] $\mathbb{R}_+ \to \omega \times \omega \times \ldots$, sending $x$ to $(a_0, a_1, \ldots)$, is again a poset isomorphism if we endow the right-hand side with the lexicographic order.

There are more and similar characterizations along these lines. 

### Smooth real numbers

The **smooth real numbers** (say in a [[smooth topos]]) are only an [[ordered local ring]] rather than an [[ordered field]], because there might be non-zero non-invertible [[nilpotent]] [[infinitesimals]] in the smooth real numbers. Nevertheless, the quotient of the smooth real numbers by the [[ideal]] of non-invertible elements is one of the ordered field of real numbers as defined above. 

### Other definitions

* [[Eudoxus real number]]
* [[prealgebra real number]]

## Topologies
{#Topologies}

There are alternative topologies on $\mathbb{R}$ sometimes considered:

* the [[discrete topology]] (not very interesting),
* the [[order topology]] or [[absolute-value topology]] (the usual topology of a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric space]]),
* the [[upper-interval topology]] or the [[lower-interval topology]],
* the [[lower semicontinuous topology]] or the [[upper semicontinuous topology]],
* the [[K-topology]].

Another variant of $\mathbb{R}$ as a topological space is the

* [[long line]].


## Generalisations

The term 'real number' was originally introduced to indicate that one is *not* considering the generalistion to [[complex numbers]] or other kinds of [[hypercomplex numbers]].  Accordingly, that term 'real' may sometimes be used for another generalisation of real numbers to indicate again that one is not considering a complexification.

The [[extended real number]]s include $\pm\infty$ as well as the real numbers; one may speak of _finite numbers_ or _bounded numbers_ to indicate that one is not considering this extension.  [[lower real|Lower reals]], [[upper reals]], and [[MacNeille real number|MacNeille reals]] are related generalisations studied in [[constructive mathematics]], although with [[excluded middle]] they are (at least if bounded) the same as ordinary real numbers; one may speak of _located numbers_ to indicate that one is not considering such extensions.

[[surreal number|Surreal numbers]] and the [[hyperreal number]]s of [[nonstandard analysis]] are two ways to include [[infinite number|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal number|infinitesimal]] versions of real numbers (besides the trivial case of $\pm\infty$); one may speak of _standard numbers_ to indicate that one is not considering such extensions (although the precise meaning of 'standard' depends on the [[universe]] that one is working in).

In [[descriptive set theory]], one often says 'real number' for an element of [[Baire space of irrational numbers|Baire space]] $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$.  This is not really a generalisation; by the [[Schroeder-Bernstein theorem]], the underlying sets of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ are [[bijection|isomorphic]].  Constructively, $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ can still be thought of as the set of [[irrational numbers]], so this use of the term may actually be a *restriction*.

[[floating-point number|Floating-point numbers]] are often used in computer programming to represent real numbers, but they do not behave very well; one may speak of _infinite-precision numbers_ to indicate that one\'s programming environment models '[*real* real numbers](http://math.fau.edu/richman/html/mm2.htm)'.

As mentioned above, the $p$-[[adic number|adic numbers]] for various [[prime numbers]] $p$ are variations on the theme of real numbers; real numbers may be thought of as _$0$-adic numbers_.  Similarly, the real numbers are _characteristic-$0$ numbers_ since they are based on the [[prime field]] $\mathbb{Q}$; one could also start the construction with a different [[characteristic]] (although it makes more sense to get analogues of complex numbers than of real numbers).

Finally, one can consider points on a [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative]] line instead of the usual _commutative numbers_.

So in summary, this page is about the _real, finite, located, standard, analytic, infinite-precision, $0$-adic, characteristic-$0$, commutative numbers_.

## In the sense of order theory

An **order** on a set $S$ is (usually) a binary [[relation]] that is, at the very least, [[transitive relation|transitive]].

Actually, there are several different notions of order that are each useful in their own ways:

* [[direction]]
* [[linear order]]
* [[partial order]]
* [[preorder]]
* [[quasiorder]]
* [[total order]]
* [[well-order]]

The closely related notion of a [[cyclic order]] is not actually a binary relation but a ternary relation.

The study of orders is [[order theory]].

## In the sense of group theory

A mostly unrelated notion from [[group theory]] is _[[order of a group]]_, meaning the [[cardinality]] $|G|$ of the [[underlying set]] of a [[group]] $G$, especially when this is [[finite set|finite]].  

By extension, one speaks of the [[order of an element]] $x \in G$, as the order of the [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] $\langle x\rangle$ generated by the element.  For example, the order of a [[permutation]] $\pi \in S_n$ is the least integer $1 \le k\le n$ such that $\pi^k = id$.

Sometimes one thinks of an [[infinite set|infinite]] group as having order [[zero]].  The orders then have the natural order relation of [[divisibility]].

## Other meanings

The term 'order' can also be used fairly generically as a synonym of 'degree' or 'rank', as in [[first-order logic]], the order of a [[differential equation]], etc.  Of course, these various orders form a [[well-order]], so this is not entirely unrelated either.

## Definition

### Order of a group
 {#OrderOfAGroup}

For $G$ a [[discrete group]], its **order** is the [[cardinality]] of the underlying [[set]].

Hence for $G$ a [[finite group]], its order $\vert G\vert \in \mathbb{N}$ is a [[natural number]], the number of its group elements.

### Order of an element of a group
 {#OrderOfAnElementOfAGroup}

For $G$ a [[group]] and $g \in G$ an [[element]], the **order** of $g$ is the smallest [[natural number]] $n$ such that the $n$-fold group product of $g$ with itself is the [[neutral element]]:

$$
  order(g) \coloneqq min \{ n \in \mathbb{N} | g^n = e\}
  \,.
$$

The _[[exponent of a group]]_ is the [[least common multiple]] of the order of all elements of the group.

### Order of a group scheme

Sometimes the term ''order'' refers to the [[height of a group scheme|height]] of a ([[group scheme|group]]) [[scheme]] $X$ over a [[field]] (of [[characteristic]] $p$) which is defined to be the dimension of the associated ring of functions $O(X)$ as a $k$-[[vector space]]. Another term for this notion is ''rank''. If this group scheme is moreover [[p-divisible group|p-divisible]] - which means that is is in fact a codirected diagram of [[group scheme|group schemes]] of order $p^{v h}$; in this case $h$ is called the order or height of $X$.

## Properties

For $G$ a [[finite group]] and $g \in G$ an element, there is a close relation between 

1. the order $\vert G\vert$ of $G$ in the sense [above](#OrderOfAGroup);

1. the order $order(g)$ of $g$ the sense [above](#OrderOfAnElementOfAGroup)


### Orders of cyclic subgroups

The element $g$ [[generators and relations|generates]] a [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] $C_g \subset G$. Evidently, the order of the element $g$ equals the order $\vert C_g \vert$ of this cyclic subgroup that it generates:

\[
  \label{OrderOfElementIsOrderOfGeneratedCyclicGroup}
  order(g) =\vert C_g\vert
  \,.
\]

### Lagrange's theorem

By [[Lagrange's theorem]], if $G$ a [[finite group]] and $H \subset G$ a [[subgroup]], then the order $\vert G\vert$ of $G$ is divisible by the order $\vert H\vert$ of $H$. The multiple is called the [[index of a subgroup|subgroup index]] $[G : H] \in \mathbb{N}$:

$$
  {\vert G\vert}
  \;=\;
  [G : H] \, {\vert H\vert}
  \,.
$$

Hence with (eq:OrderOfElementIsOrderOfGeneratedCyclicGroup) it follows that with $g \in G$ any element, the order of $g$ divides the order of $G$:

$$
  {\vert G\vert}/ order(g)
  \;=\;
  [G : C_g]

## In the sense of order theory

An **order** on a set $S$ is (usually) a binary [[relation]] that is, at the very least, [[transitive relation|transitive]].

Actually, there are several different notions of order that are each useful in their own ways:

* [[direction]]
* [[linear order]]
* [[partial order]]
* [[preorder]]
* [[quasiorder]]
* [[total order]]
* [[well-order]]

The closely related notion of a [[cyclic order]] is not actually a binary relation but a ternary relation.

The study of orders is [[order theory]].

## In the sense of group theory

A mostly unrelated notion from [[group theory]] is _[[order of a group]]_, meaning the [[cardinality]] $|G|$ of the [[underlying set]] of a [[group]] $G$, especially when this is [[finite set|finite]].  

By extension, one speaks of the [[order of an element]] $x \in G$, as the order of the [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] $\langle x\rangle$ generated by the element.  For example, the order of a [[permutation]] $\pi \in S_n$ is the least integer $1 \le k\le n$ such that $\pi^k = id$.

Sometimes one thinks of an [[infinite set|infinite]] group as having order [[zero]].  The orders then have the natural order relation of [[divisibility]].

## Other meanings

The term 'order' can also be used fairly generically as a synonym of 'degree' or 'rank', as in [[first-order logic]], the order of a [[differential equation]], etc.  Of course, these various orders form a [[well-order]], so this is not entirely unrelated either.

## Idea

A _limit_ of a [[sequence]] (or [[net]]) of points $(x_i)$ in a [[topological space]] (or other [[convergence space]]) $X$ is a point $x$ such that the sequence eventually gets arbitrarily close to $x$.  We can also speak of a limit of a [[filter]] on $X$.

The notion is of particular and historical importance in [[analysis]], where it serves to define for instance the notion of [[derivative]].


## Definitions

The precise definition depends on what sort of space $X$ is.

+-- {: .num_defn #topological}
###### Definition

If $X$ a [[topological space]] and $I$ the set of [[natural numbers]] (or more generally any [[directed set]]) and $\nu = (x_i)_{i\in I}\colon I \to X$ is a [[sequence]] (or a [[net]]) of points in $X$, one says that a point $x \in X$ is a **limit** of $\nu$ or that $\nu$ **converges** to $x$ if for each [[neighbourhood]] $U$ in $X$ of $x$ there exists an $n \in I$ such that $x_i \in U$ for each $i \geq n$.
=--

An important special case (the original) is:

+-- {: .num_defn #real}
###### Definition

If $X$ the [[real line]] and $I$ the set of [[natural numbers]] (or more generally any [[directed set]]) and $\nu = (x_i)_{i\in I}\colon I \to X$ is a [[sequence]] (or a [[net]]) of [[real numbers]], one says that a point $x \in X$ is a **limit** of $\nu$ or that $\nu$ **converges** to $x$ if for each [[positive number]] $\epsilon$ there exists an $n \in I$ such that ${|x_i - x|} \lt \epsilon$ for each $i \geq n$.
=--

An important generalization (possibly the most general) is:

+-- {: .num_defn #convergence}
###### Definition

If $X$ a [[convergence space]] and $I$ the set of [[natural numbers]] (or more generally any [[directed set]]) and $\nu = (x_i)_{i\in I}\colon I \to X$ is a [[sequence]] (or a [[net]]) of points in $X$, one says that a point $x \in X$ is a **limit** of $\nu$ or that $\nu$ **converges** to $x$ if the [[eventuality filter]] of $\nu$ converges to $x$ (which is a primitive concept in convergence spaces).
=--

Other types of [[space]] for which we might put in definitions (or which might have definitions on their own pages) are ([[extended metric space|extended]]) ([[quasimetric space|quasi]])-([[pseudometric space|pseudo]])-[[metric spaces]], [[premetric spaces]], ([[quasiuniform space|quasi]])-[[uniform spaces]], [[pretopological spaces]], and (quasi)-[[uniform convergence spaces]].


### Notation

When one of the conditions above holds, we may write any of the following, where '$\to$' is read as 'converges to':

* $\nu \to x$,
* $x_i \to_i x$,
* $x_i \to x$ (suppressing the index $i$ by abuse of notation).


Or we may write any of the following, were $\lim$ is read as 'the set of limits of':

* $x \in \lim \nu$,
* $x \in \lim_i x_i$,
* $x \in \lim x_i$ (suppressing the index $i$ by abuse of notation).

Of course, the right-hand side has a meaning by itself, as the set of limits itself (a [[subset]] of the [[underlying set]] of $X$, or a [[subspace]] of $X$ itself).


If $X$ is a [[Hausdorff space]], then there is at most one point $x$ with the property that the sequence (or net) $\nu$ converges to $x$.  Then we may write any of the following, were now $\lim$ is read as 'the limit of':

* $x = \lim \nu$,
* $x = \lim_i x_i$,
* $x = \lim x_i$ (suppressing the index $i$ by abuse of notation).

Now the right-hand side by itself is the possibly undefined [[term]] for the limit itself (if it exists).


### Limits of filters

More generally than [[sequences]], and equivalently to [[nets]], we may speak of limits of [[filters]] on $X$.  This concept is axiomatized directly in the concept of [[convergence space]]. In the case of a [[topological space]] $X$, a filter of subsets of $X$ converges to a point $x$ if every neighbourhood of $x$ is contained in the filter.

In the definitions above, equivalent nets (those with equal [[eventuality filters]]) always converge to the same point.  As every [[proper filter]] is the eventuality filter of some net, a proper filter converges to $x$ if any of these nets converges to $x$; the [[improper filter]] converges to every point.  (In [[constructive mathematics]], we may cover all filters by saying: $F$ converges to $x$ if, on the assumption that $F$ is proper, any of its nets converges to $x$.)

## Properties

### Relation to limits in the sense of category theory
 {#RelationToLimitsInCategoryTheory}

The [[limits]] of [[category theory]] are a great generalization of an analogy with the limits discussed here.  It turns out, however, that limits in [[topological spaces]] (at least) can be viewed as category-theoretic limits. For now, see [this math.sx answer](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/62800).

# Limit points

## Idea

Given a [[space]] $S$, a [[subspace]] $A$ of $S$, and a [[concrete point]] $x$ in $S$, $x$ is a _limit point_ of $A$ if $x$ can be approximated by the contents of $A$.

There are several variations on this idea, and the term 'limit point' itself is ambiguous (sometimes meaning Definition \ref{adherent}, sometimes Definition \ref{accumulation}.


## Definitions

The classical definitions apply when $S$ is a [[topological space]].  Then $A$ may be thought of as a [[subset]] of (the [[underlying set]] of) $S$, and $x$ as an [[element]].  In order to apply the definitions in [[constructive mathematics]], there needs to be an [[inequality relation]] $\ne$ on the points of $S$; in [[classical mathematics]], this is taken to be the [[denial inequality]], as usual.  (We need not assume that $\ne$ is an [[apartness relation]] nor any compatibility between $\ne$ and the topology, at least for the definitions; although it\'s quite possible that some classical theorems will require such assumptions.)

For the most general definitions, let $\kappa$ be a collection of [[cardinal numbers]].  (We might want $\kappa$ to have some closure properties akin to those of an [[arity class]], but the definition there is not quite what we want.)  Recall that a _$\kappa$-[[arity|ary]] [[indexed subset]]_ of $S$ is a [[function]] $B\colon I \to S$ such that the [[cardinality]] of $I$ belongs to the class $\kappa$; a point $y$ is _in_ $B$ (as an indexed subset) if $y$ belongs to the [[range]] of $B$ (as a function), and $y$ is _out_ of $B$ if $y$ is inequal ($\ne$) to every point in $B$.

+-- {: .num_defn #general}
###### Definitions

The point $x$ is a __$\kappa$-adherent point__ of the subspace $A$ if, for each [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $x$, for each $\kappa$-ary indexed subset $B$ of the [[intersection]] $U \cap A$, there is an element $y$ of $U \cap A$ that is out of $B$.  Slightly more strongly, $x$ is a __$\kappa$-accumulation point__ (or __$\kappa$-cluster point__)  of $A$ if, for each neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, for each $\kappa$-ary indexed subset $B$ of $U \cap A$, there is an element $y \ne x$ of $U \cap A$ that is out of $B$.  (Alternatively, take $U$ to be a [[punctured neighborhood]], but that won\'t work constructively in general.)
=--

Every $\kappa$-accumulation point is a $\kappa$-adherent point; the converse holds if every $k \in \kappa$ satisfies $k + 1 \in \kappa$ (and then one usually says 'accumulation' rather than 'adherent').  Also, if $\kappa \subseteq \lambda$, then every $\lambda$-(adherent/accumulation) point is a $\kappa$-(adherent/accumulation) point.

It immediately follows that the following classical special cases are in order of increasing strength:

*  Using $\kappa = 1 = \{0\}$:

   +-- {: .num_defn #adherent}
   ###### Definition

   The point $x$ is an __adherent point__ of the subspace $A$ if, for every neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, the intersection $U \cap A$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]] (nonempty).
   =--

*  Using $\kappa = 1$ again:

   +-- {: .num_defn #accumulation}
   ###### Definition

   The point $x$ is an __accumulation point__ of the subspace $A$ if, for every punctured neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, the intersection $U \cap A$ is inhabited.
   =--

*  Using $\kappa = \omega = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$:

   +-- {: .num_defn #omega}
   ###### Definition

   The point $x$ is an __$\omega$-accumulation point__ (or __$\infty$-accumulation point__) of the subspace $A$ if, for every neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, the intersection $U \cap A$ is [[infinite set|infinite]].
   =--

*  Using $\kappa = \omega_1 = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, \aleph_0\}$:

   +-- {: .num_defn #condensation}
   ###### Definition

   The point $x$ is a __condensation point__ of the subspace $A$ if, for every neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, the intersection $U \cap A$ is [[uncountable set|uncountable]].
   =--


## Properties

The subspace $A$ is [[closed subspace|closed]] iff every adherent point of $A$ belongs to $A$ and iff every accumulation point of $A$ belongs to $A$.  (Thus one may say that $A$ is closed iff every limit point of $A$ belongs to $A$ without ambiguity.)

More generally, the [[topological closure|closure]] of $A$ is the set of all adherent points of $A$.  This justifies using 'limit point' to mean an adherent point: the adherent points of $A$ are precisely those that are limits of [[nets]] of points in $A$.  Classically (using [[excluded middle]], or more generally if $S$ has [[decidable equality]]), the closure of $A$ is the [[union]] of $A$ and its set of accumulation points.

The set of accumulation points of $A$ is also called the _[[derived set]]_ of $A$, denoted $A'$.  The study of derived sets is of great historical importance in [[Georg Cantor]]\'s development of [[set theory]], even though closure sets are more important in modern mathematics.  Note that while $Cl(Cl(A)) = Cl(A)$, no similar relationship holds between $A'$ and $A''$, $A'''$, etc; one can even continue this into transfinite [[ordinal numbers]] (possibly their earliest application).

Classically, a point in $A$ that is not an accumulation point of $A$ is precisely an [[isolated point]] of $A$.  (Constructively, each of these is stronger than the negation of the other, but the two conditions may be taken to be [[antithesis interpretation|antitheses]].)

A justification for the terminology 'limit point' for an accumulation point is that the concept of [[limit of a function]] approaching a point really only makes sense approaching an accumulation point.  (This is for essentially the same reason that every function is continuous at an isolated point.)  Indeed, every answer whatsoever satisfies the naive definition of $\lim_c f$ if $c$ is an isolated point of $dom f$ (because the [[improper filter]] converges everywhere).

## Idea

In [[category theory]] a limit of a [[diagram]] $F : D \to C$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[object]] $lim F$ of $C$ equipped with morphisms to the objects $F(d)$ for all $d \in D$, such that everything in sight commutes. Moreover, the limit $lim F$ is the _universal_ object with this property, i.e. the "most optimized solution" to the problem of finding such an object.

The limit construction has a wealth of applications throughout category theory and mathematics in general.  In practice, it is possibly best thought of in the context of [[representable functor]]s as a [[classifying space]] for maps into a diagram. So in some sense the limit object $lim F$ "subsumes" the entire diagram $F(D)$ into a single object, as far as morphisms _into_ it are concerned.
The corresponding universal object for morphisms _out_ of the diagram is the [[colimit]]. 

An intuitive general idea is that a limit of a diagram is the locus or solution set of a bunch of equations, where each of the coordinates is parametrized by one of the objects of the diagram, and where the equations are prescribed by the morphisms of the diagram. This idea is explained more formally [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/limits+and+colimits+by+example#limitsintermsofotherops). 

Often, the general theory of limits (but not colimits!) works better if the source of $F$ is taken to be the [[opposite category]] $D^op$ (or equivalently, if $F$ is taken to be a [[contravariant functor]]).  This is what we do below.  In any given situation, of course, you use whatever categories and functors you\'re interested in.

In some cases the category-theoretic notion of limit does reproduce notions of limit as known from analysis. See the examples below.

### Global versus local 

In correspondence to the _local_ definition of [[adjoint functor]]s (as discussed there), there is a _local_ definition of limits (in terms of cones), that defines a limit (if it exists) for each individual diagram, and there is a _global_ definition, which defines the limit for _all_ diagrams (in terms of an [[adjoint functor|adjoint]]).

If all limits over the given shape of diagrams exist in a category, then both definitions are equivalent.

See also the analogous discussion at [[homotopy limit]].


## Terminology and notation 

A limit is taken over a [[functor]] $F : D^{op} \to C$ and since the functor comes equipped with the information about what its domain is, one can just write $\lim F$ for its limit. But often it is helpful to indicate how the functor is evaluated on objects, in which case the limit is written $\lim_{d \in D} F(d)$; this is used particularly when $F$ is given by a formula (as with other notation with bound variables.)

In some schools of mathematics, limits are called _projective limits_, while colimits are called _inductive limits_.  Also seen are (respectively) _inverse limits_ and _direct limits_.  Both these systems of terminology are alternatives to using 'co-' when distinguishing limits and colimits.  The first system also appears in [[pro-object]] and [[ind-object]].

Correspondingly, the symbols $\underset{\leftarrow}lim$ and $\underset{\rightarrow}\lim$ are used instead of $\lim$ and $\colim$.

Confusingly, many authors restrict the meanings of these alternative terms to (co)limits whose sources are [[direction|directed set]]s; see [[directed limit]].  In fact, this is the original meaning; projective and inductive limits in this sense were studied in algebra before the general category-theoretic notion of (co)limit.

## Definition

### Local definition in terms of representable functors 

There is a general abstract definition of limits
in terms of representable functors, which we 
describe now. This reproduces the more concrete
and maybe more familiar description in terms of
universal cones, which is described further below.

Let in the following $D$ be a [[small category]] and [[Set]] the category of sets (possibly realized as the category $U Set$ of $U$-small sets with respect to a given [[Grothendieck universe]].) 

#### Limit of a Set-valued functor

The **limit of a Set-valued functor** $F : D^{op} \to Set$ is the [[hom-set]] 
$$
  lim F \coloneqq Hom_{[D^{op}, Set]}(pt, F)
  \in Set
$$
in the [[functor category]] $[D^{op}, Set]$ (the [[presheaf]] category), where

$$
  pt : D^{op} \to Set
$$
$$
  pt : d \mapsto \{*\}
$$
is the functor constant on the [[point]], i.e. the [[terminal object|terminal]] diagram.

The set $lim F$ is equivalently called 

* the set of _global sections_ of $F$;

* the set of [[generalized element]]s of $F$.

The set $lim F$ can be equivalently expressed as an [[equalizer]] of a [[product]], explicitly:

$$
  lim F \simeq
  \left\lbrace
    (x_d)_{d \in D}
    \in
    \prod_{d \in D}
    F(d)
    |
    \forall (d_i \stackrel{\alpha}{\to} d_j) \in D :
    F(\alpha)(x_{d_j}) = x_{d_i}
  \right\rbrace
$$

In particular, the limit of a set-valued functor always exists. 

Notice the important triviality that the covariant [[hom-functor]] commutes with set-valued limits: for every set $S$ we have a bijection of sets

$$
  Hom_{Set}(S, lim F)
  \simeq
  \lim Hom_{Set}(S, F(-))
  \,,
$$

where $Hom(S, F(-)) : D^{op} \to Set$.


#### Limit of a functor with values in an arbitrary category 

The above formula generalizes straightforwardly to
a notion of limit for 
functors $F : D^{op} \to C$ for $C$
an arbitrary category if we construct a certain [[presheaf]] on $C$ which we will call $\hat \lim F$. The actual limit $lim F$ is then, if it exists, the object of $C$ [[representable functor|representing]] this presheaf.

More precisely, using the [[Yoneda embedding]] $y: C \to [C^{op}, Set]$ define for $F : D^{op} \to C$ the [[presheaf]] $\hat \lim F \in [C^{op}, Set]$ by

$$
  (\hat \lim F)(c)\coloneqq Hom_{Set^{D^{op}}}(pt,Hom_C(c,F(-)))
$$

for all $c \in C$, or suppressing the subscripts for readability:

$$
  (\hat lim F)(c) = 
  Hom(pt , Hom(c,F(-)))
  \,.
$$

The [[presheaf]]-valued limit always exists; iff this presheaf is [[representable functor|representable]] by an object $\lim F$ of $C$, then this is the **limit** of $F$:

$$
  Hom(c, \lim F)
  \simeq
  Hom(pt, Hom(c,F(-)))
  \,.
$$

#### Generalization to weighted limits 

In the above formulation, there is an evident
generalization to [[weighted limit]]s:

replace in the above the constant terminal functor
$pt : D^{op} \to Set$ with _any_ functor
$W : D^{op} \to Set$ -- then called the _weight_ --,
then the $W$-weighted limit of $F$ 

$$
  \lim_W F
$$

often written

$$
  \{W,F\}
$$

is, if it exists, the
object representing the presheaf
$$
 c \mapsto
    Hom_{[D^{op}, Set]}(W , Hom_C(c,F(-)))
  \,,
$$

i.e. such that

$$
  Hom(c, \lim_W F)
  \simeq
  Hom(W, Hom(c,F(-)))
  \,
$$

naturally in $c \in C$.

#### Relation to continuous functors 

The very definition of limit as above asserts
that the covariant [[hom-functor]] 
$Hom(c,-) : C \to Set$
commutes with
forming limits. Indeed, the definition is equivalent
to saying that the [[hom-functor]] is a 
[[continuous functor]].


### Definition in terms of universal cones 

Unwrapping the above abstract definition of limits
yields the following more hands-on description  in terms
of universal cones.

#### Unwrapping 

Let $F : D^{op} \to C$ be a functor.

Notice that for every object $c \in C$ an element
$$
  * \to Hom(pt, Hom(c, F(-)))
$$ 
is to be identified with a collection of morphisms
$$
  c \to F(d)
$$
for all $d \in D$, such that all triangles
$$
  \array{
     && c
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     F(d_i)
     && \stackrel{F(f)}{\to}
     &&
     F(d_j)
  }
$$
commute. Such a collection of morphisms is called a **cone** over $F$, for the obvious reason. 

If the limit 
$\lim F \in C$ of $F$ exist, then it
singles out a special cone given by
the composite morphism
$$
  *
  \stackrel{* \mapsto Id_{\lim F}}{\to}
  Hom_C(\lim F, \lim F)
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  
  Hom(pt, Hom(\lim F, F(-)))
  \,,
$$
where the first morphism picks the [[identity morphism]]
on $\lim F$ and the second one is the defining
bijection of a limit as above.

The cone
$$
  \array{
     && \lim F
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     F(d_i)
     && \stackrel{F(f)}{\to}
     &&
     F(d_j)
  }
$$
is called the **universal cone** over $F$, because,
again by the defining property of limit as above,
every other cone $\{c \to F(d)\}_{d \in D}$ as 
above is bijectively related to a morphism
$c \to  \lim F$ 

$$
  *
  \stackrel{\{c \to F(d)\}_{d \in D}}{\to}
  Hom(pt, Hom(c, F(-)))
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  
  Hom(c, \lim F)
  \,.
$$

By inspection one finds that, indeed, the morphism
$c \to \lim F$ is the morphism which exhibits the
factorization of the cone $\{c \to F(d)\}_{d \in D}$
through the universal limit cone

$$
  \array{
     && c
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     F(d_i)
     && \stackrel{F(f)}{\to}
     &&
     F(d_j)
  }
  =
  \array{
     && c
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && \lim F
     \\

  \,.
$$
An illustrative example is the following: a limit of the [[identity functor]] $Id_c:C\to C$ is, if it exists, an [[initial object]] of $C$.


### Global Definition in terms of adjoint of the constant diagram functor 

Given categories $D$ and $C$, limits over functors $D^{op} \to C$ may exist for some functors, but not for all. If it does exist for all functors, then the above _local definition_ of limits is equivalent to the following _global definition_.

For $D$ a [[small category]] and $C$ any category, the [[functor category]] $[D^{op},C]$ is the category of $D$-[[diagram]]s in $C$.  Pullback along the functor $D^{op} \to pt$ to the [[terminal object|terminal]] category $pt = \{\bullet\}$ induces a functor
$$
  const :  C \to [D^{op},C]
$$
which sends every object of $C$ to the diagram functor constant on this object.

The [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]]
$$
  colim_D : [D^{op},C] \to C
$$
of this functor is, if it exists, the functor
which sends every diagram to its [[colimit]] and the [[adjoint functor|right adjoint]] is, if it exists, the functor
$$
  lim_D : [D^{op},C] \to C
$$
which sends every diagram to its [[limit]]. The Hom-isomorphisms of these [[adjunction]]s state precisely the universal property of [[limit]] and [[colimit]] given above.

Concretely this means that for all $c \in C$ we have a bijection
$$
  Hom_C(c, \lim F)
  \simeq
  Hom_{[D^{op},C]}(const_c, F)
  \,.
$$


From this perspective, a limit is a special case of a [[Kan extension]], as described there, namely a Kan extension to the [[point]].

### Generalizations 

The notion of limit, being fundamental to 
[[category theory]], generalizes to many other situations.  Examples include the following.

* In [[enriched category theory]] one has the notion of [[weighted limit]].  This makes sense in ordinary category theory as well, but it turns out that in that case all weighted limits reduce to ordinary "conical" ones.
* Weighted limits generalize further to the notion of limit in a [[2-category equipped with proarrows]], or to a [[Yoneda structure]].
* In [[2-category theory]] one has the notion of a [[2-limit]].
* Similarly, in [[(infinity,1)-category]] theory there is a notion of a limit.  Using quasicategories as a model for $(\infty,1)$-categories, the definition is a straightforward extension of the one as a terminal cone: it is simply a [[terminal object in a quasi-category|quasi-categorical terminal object]] in the quasicategory of cones.  See [[limit in quasi-categories]].
* One expects that similarly, all sorts of [[higher categories]] have their own appropriate notions of limit and colimit.  


## Examples

The central point about examples of limits is:

_Categorical limits are ubiquitous_. 

To a fair extent, [[category theory]] is all about limits and the other [[universal construction]]s: [[Kan extension]]s, [[adjoint functor]]s, [[representable functor]]s, which are all special cases of limits -- and limits are special cases of these.

Listing examples of limits in [[category theory]] is much like listing examples of [[integral]]s in [[analysis]]: one can and does fill books with these. (In fact, that analogy has more to it than meets the casual eye: see [[coend]] for more).


Keeping that in mind, we do list some special cases and special classes of examples that are useful to know. But any list is necessarily wildly incomplete.

### General

* For a pedagogical list of examples see [[limits and colimits by example]].

Here are some important examples of limits, classified by the shape of the [[diagram]]:

* A limit of the [[empty set|empty diagram]] is a [[terminal object]].
* A limit of a diagram consisting of two (or more) objects and no nontrivial morphisms is their [[product]].
* A limit of a [[cospan]] is a [[pullback]].
* A limit of a pair (or more) of [[parallel morphisms]] is an [[equalizer]].
* A limit over a [[finite category]] is a [[finite limit]].
* Another important "shape" of limits are those that give rise to [[end]]s.

### Limits in analysis

The concept of [[limit of a sequence]] in [[topological spaces]] is a special case of category theoretic limits, see [there](limit+of+a+sequence#RelationToLimitsInCategoryTheory).

## Properties

### Existence: construction from products and equalizers
 {#ConstructionFromProductsAndEqualizers}

Frequently some limits can be computed in terms of other limits.  This makes things easier since we only have to assume that categories have, or functors preserve, some easier-to-verify class of limits in order to obtain results about a larger one.

The most common example of this is the computation of limits in terms of products and equalizers.  Specifically, if the limit of $F : D^{op} \to C$ and the [[products]] $\prod_{d\in Obj(D)} F(d)$ and $\prod_{f\in Mor{d}} F(s(f))$ all exist, then $lim F$ is a [[subobject]] of $\prod_{d\in Obj(D)} F(d)$, namely the [[equalizer]] of

$$
  \prod_{d \in Obj(D)}
  F(d)
  \stackrel{\prod_{f \in Mor(d)} (F(f) \circ p_{s(f)}) }{\to}  
  \prod_{f \in Mor(D)}
  F(s(f))
$$

and

$$
  \prod_{d \in Obj(D)}
  F(d)
  \stackrel{\prod_{f \in Mor(d)} (p_{t(f)}) }{\to}  
  \prod_{f \in Mor(D)}
  F(s(f))  
  \,.
$$

Conversely, if both of these products exist and so does the equalizer of this pair of maps, then that equalizer is a limit of $F$.  In particular, therefore, a category has all limits as soon as it has all products and equalizers, and a functor defined on such a category [[preserved limit|preserves]] all limits as soon as it preserves products and equalizers.

(More precisely, it suffices only to consider equalizers of [[reflexive pairs]].)

Another example is that all [[finite limits]] can be computed in terms of [[pullbacks]] and a [[terminal object]].

### Interaction with $Hom$-functor

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
**([[hom-functor preserves limits]])**

For $C$ a [[locally small]] category,
for $F : D^{op} \to C$ a functor and writing $C(c, F(-)) : D^{op} \to Set$, we have
$$
  C(c, lim F) \simeq lim C(c, F(-))
  \,.
$$
=--

Depending on how one introduces limits this holds by definition or is an easy consequence.




### In $Set$

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Limits in Set are hom-sets

For $F : D^{op} \to Set$ any functor and $const_{*} : D^{op} \to Set$ the functor constant on the [[point]], the limit of $F$ is the [[hom-set]]
$$
  lim F \simeq [D^{op}, Set](const_{*}, F)
$$
in the [[functor category]], i.e. the set of [[natural transformation]]s from the constant functor into $F$.
=--

### In functor categories

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition
**(limits in functor categories are computed pointwise)

Let $D$ be a small category and let $D'$ be any category. Let $C$ be a category which admits limits of shape $D$. Write $[D',C]$ for the [[functor category]]. Then

* $[D',C]$ admits $D$-shaped limits;
* these limits are computed objectwise ("pointwise") in $C$: for $F : D^{op} \to [D',C]$ a functor we have for all $d' \in D'$ that $(lim F)(d') \simeq lim (F(-)(d'))$. Here the limit on the right is in $C$.
=--

### Compatibility with universal constructions
 {#CompatibilityAmongUniversalConstructions}

+-- {: .num_prop #RightAdjointsPreserveLimits}
###### Proposition
**([[right adjoints preserve limits]])

Let $R \;\colon\; C \to C'$ be a [[functor]] that is [[right adjoint]] to some functor $L : C' \to C$. Let $D$ be a [[small category]] such that $C$ admits [[limits]] of shape $D$. Then $R$ [[preserved limit|commutes with]] $D$-shaped limits in $C$ in that

for $F : D^{op} \to C$ some diagram, we have

$$
  R(lim F) \simeq lim (R \circ F)
  \,.
$$
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof

Using the adjunction isomorphism and the above fact that [[hom-functor preserves limits]], one obtains for every $c' \in C'$

$$
\begin{aligned}
  C'(c', R (lim F)) & \simeq C(L(c'), lim F)
  \\
  & \simeq lim C(L(c'), F) 
  \\
  & \simeq lim C'(c', R\circ F)
  \\
  & \simeq C'(c', lim (R \circ F)) 
  \,.
\end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Since this holds naturally for every $c'$, the [[Yoneda lemma|Yoneda lemma, corollary II]] on uniqueness of representing objects implies that $R (lim F) \simeq lim (R \circ F)$.

=--



+-- {: .num_prop #LimitsCommuteWithLimits}
###### Proposition
**([[limits commute with limits]])**

Let $D$ and $D'$ be [[small categories]] and let $C$ be
a category which admits [[limits]] of shape $D$ as well as
[[limits]] of shape $D'$. Then these limits commute with each other, in that 
for $F : D^{op} \times {D'}^{op} \to C$ a [[functor]] , with corresponding induced functors $F_D : {D'}^{op} \to [D^{op},C]$ and $F_{D'} : {D}^{op} \to [{D'}^{op},C]$, then the canonical comparison morphism 

\[
  \label{ComparisonMorphismForCommutingLimits}
  lim F \simeq lim_{D}  (lim_{D'} F_D )
  \simeq
   lim_{D'}  (lim_{D} F_{D'} )
\]

is an [[isomorphism]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof

Since the [[limit]]-construction is the [[right adjoint]] functor to the [[constant functor|constant]] [[diagram]]-functor, this is a special case of _[[right adjoints preserve limits]]_ (Prop. \ref{RightAdjointsPreserveLimits}).

=--

See [[limits and colimits by example]] for what formula (eq:ComparisonMorphismForCommutingLimits) says for instance for the special case $C =$ [[Set]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(general non-commutativity of limits with colimits)**

In general limits do _not_ commute with [[colimits]]. But under a number of special conditions of interest they do. Special cases and concrete examples are discussed at _[[commutativity of limits and colimits]]_.

# The intermediate value theorem
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

The _intermediate value theorem_ (IVT) is a fundamental principle of [[analysis]] which allows one to find a desired value by [[interpolation]].  It says that a [[continuous function]] $f \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ from an [[interval]] to the [[real numbers]] (all with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[topological space|topology]]) takes all values in between $f(0)$ and $f(1)$.

The IVT in its general form was not used by [[Euclid]].  Although it is hard to doubt that Euclid believed that, for any given angle, there was an angle with one-third the measure, this angle cannot be constructed by the methods available to Euclid, so he would never refer to it (see at _[[Euclidean geometry]]_).  In contrast, [[Archimedes]] made general arguments in which a quantity is approached from above and below, allowing him not only to trisect the angle but also to calculate [[pi|π]].

As normally stated, the IVT is not valid in [[constructive mathematics]], although there are constructively valid versions. These versions either weaken the conclusion to an *approximate* zero, or to strengthen the hypothesis to require the functions satisfy additional properties or have other structures, such as locally nonconstancy and lifting to locators in functions in the given example below. Even interpreted classically, these are prima facie weaker results.

## Statements and Proofs

### Classical IVT

+-- {: .num_theorem #classical}
###### Theorem
(classical IVT, assuming [[excluded middle]])

Let $f\colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a [[continuous function]] from a [[compact space|compact]] [[closed interval]] to the [[real line]], and suppose that $f(a) \lt 0$ while $f(b) \gt 0$. Then there exists a point $c$ in the unit interval such that $f(c) = 0$.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined as $g(x) \coloneqq (b - a) x + a$. Then there exists a function $h:[1,0] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f = g \circ h$. 

By [this example](connected+topological+space) the interval $[0,1]$ is a [[connected topological space]] (this is where [[excluded middle]] is used).

By [this prop.](connected+topological+space) also its [[image]] $f([0,1]) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is connected. By [this example](connected+topological+space) that image is itself an interval. This implies the claim is true for $h$. Since linear functions preserve the properties of an interval being compact and closed, if the claim is true for $h$, it is true for $f$.

### Constructive IVT with weakened conclusion

+-- {: .num_theorem #conclusion}
###### Theorem
(constructive IVT with weakened conclusion)

For real numbers $a$ and $b$, let $f\colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a [[pointwise continuous function]] from the [[closed interval]] $[a, b]$ to the [[real line]], and supposed that $f(a) \lt 0$ and $f(b) \gt 0$. Then for every positive number $\epsilon$ there exists a point $c_\epsilon$ in the unit interval such that ${|f(c_\epsilon)|} \lt \epsilon$.
=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of Theorem \ref{conclusion}&#8288;

This proof originally appeared in [Frank 2020](#Frank20). 

Let us inductively define the following [[sequences]]:

$$a_0 \coloneqq a$$ 
$$b_0 \coloneqq b$$ 
$$c_n \coloneqq \frac{a_n + b_n}{2}$$
$$d_n \coloneqq \max\left(0, \min\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{f(c_\epsilon)}{\epsilon}, 1\right)\right)$$
$$a_{n + 1} = c_n - \frac{d_n (b - a)}{2^{n + 1}}$$
$$a_{n + 1} = b_n - \frac{d_n (b - a)}{2^{n + 1}}$$

Then 
$$b_n - a_n = \frac{b - a}{2^n}$$

and the sequence $c_n$ is a [[Cauchy sequence]], because for [[natural numbers]] $m \lt n$, 

$$\vert c_m - c_n \vert \leq \frac{b - a}{2^m}$$

Lemma: For every natural number $m$, either 1. there exists a $j \leq m$ such that $\vert f(c_j) \lt \epsilon$, or 2. $f(a_m) \lt 0$ and $f(b_m) \gt 0$. This could be proved by induction on natural numbers: 

When $m = 0$, $f(a_0) = f(a) \lt 0$ and $f(b_0) = f(b) \gt 0$. 

Now, assume that the above lemma is true for a particular $m$. If there exists a $j \leq m$ such that $\vert f(c_j) \lt \epsilon$, then there exists a $j \leq m + 1$ such that $\vert f(c_j) \lt \epsilon$. Otherwise, either $2 f(c_m) \lt -\epsilon$, $2 f(c_m) \gt \epsilon$, or $\vert f(c_m) \vert \gt \epsilon$. 

* If $2 f(c_m) \lt -\epsilon$, then we define 
$$d_m \coloneqq 1$$
$$a_{m + 1} \coloneqq a_m$$
$$b_{m + 1} \coloneqq c_m$$
so that $a_{m + 1} \lt 0$ and $b_{m + 1} \gt 0$. 

* If $2 f(c_m) \gt \epsilon$, then we define 
$$d_m \coloneqq 1$$
$$a_{m + 1} \coloneqq c_m$$
$$b_{m + 1} \coloneqq b_m$$
so that $a_{m + 1} \lt 0$ and $b_{m + 1} \gt 0$. 

* If $\vert f(c_m) \vert \gt \epsilon$, then there exists a $j \leq m + 1$ such that $\vert f(c_j) \lt \epsilon$. 

Thus, the above lemma is true. 

Now, by pointwise continuity at $c$, let $\delta$ be such that $\vert x - y \vert \lt \delta$ implies $\vert f(x) - f(y)\vert  \lt \epsilon$. Choose a natural number $m$ such that 

$$\vert c - c_m \vert \lt \frac{\delta}{2}$$ 
$$\frac{\vert b - a \vert}{2^{m + 1}} \lt \frac{\delta}{2}$$ 

If there exists a $j \leq m$ such that $\vert f(c_j) \lt \epsilon$, then the intermediate value is true. Otherwise, $f(a_m) \lt 0$ and $f(b_m) \gt 0$, and so

$$\vert c - c_m \vert \lt \vert c - c_m \vert + \vert c_m - a_m \vert \lt \delta$$
$$\vert c - c_m \vert \lt \vert c - c_m \vert + \vert c_m - b_m \vert \lt \delta$$

and so that means that 

$$\vert f(c) - f(a_m) \vert \lt \epsilon$$
$$\vert f(c) - f(b_m) \vert \lt \epsilon$$

which means that $\vert f(c) \vert \lt \epsilon$. 

=--

If [[excluded middle]] is true, then the classical IVT follows from the above theorem:

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of Theorem \ref{classical}&#8288;

By way of contradiction (applying the [[double negation]] law of [[classical logic]]), suppose that ${|f(c)|} \gt 0$ for every $c$ in $[0,1]$.  Then the extra hypothesis of Theorem \ref{hypothesis} is certainly satisfied, so there exists some $c$ such that $f(c) = 0$ after all.  (Constructively, this is enough to show that the classical theorem has no counterexample.)

# Differentiable maps
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

A [[function]] (map) is *differentiable* at some point if it can be well approximated by a [[linear map]] near that point.  The approximating linear maps at different points together form the *derivative* of the map.

One may then ask whether the derivative itself is differentiable, and so on.  This leads to a hierarchy of ever more differentiable maps, starting with [[continuous maps]] and progressing through maps that are $n$ times (continuously) differentiable to those that are infinitely differentiable, and finally to those that are [[analytic map|analytic]].  Infinitely differentiable maps are sometimes called *smooth*.

Differentiability is first defined directly for maps between (open subsets of) a [[Cartesian space]].  These differentiable maps can then be used to define the notion of [[differentiable manifold]], and then a more general notion of differentiable map *between* differentiable manifolds, forming a [[category]] called [[Diff]].  We have a parallel hierarchy of ever more differentiable manifolds and ever more differentiable maps between them.  Since every more differentiable manifold has an [[underlying]] less differentiable manifold, we may always consider maps that are less differentiable than the manifolds between which they run.


## Definitions

In all of the following $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the [[real numbers]] and $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ 
their $n$-fold [[Cartesian product]]. For $i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}$ we write

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^n &\overset{pr_i}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \vec v = (v_1, \cdots, v_n) &\mapsto& v_i
  }
$$

for the [[projection]] map onto the $i$th factor.

When considering [[convergence]] of [[sequences]] of elements of these
sets we regard them as [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric spaces]] with the [[Euclidean norm]]

$$
  {\Vert -\Vert} \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow [0,\infty) \subset \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$ 

The [[open subsets]] of the corresponding [[metric topology]] are the [[unions]] of [[open balls]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

### In the real numbers

#### Epsilon-delta definition

A function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is **differentiable** if it comes with a function $\frac{d f}{d x}:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and a function $M_f:\mathbb{Q}_+ \to \mathbb{Q}_+$ in the positive rational numbers, such that 

* for every positive rational number $\epsilon \in \mathbb{Q}_+$, for every real number $h \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $0 \lt | h | \lt M_f(\epsilon)$, and for every real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$, 
$$\left|f(x + h) - \frac{d f}{d x}(x)\right| \lt \epsilon |h|$$

#### Infinitesimal definition

Given a predicate $P$ on the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, let $I$ denote the set of all elements in $\mathbb{R}$ for which $P$ holds. A [[partial function]] $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is equivalently a function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ for any such predicate $P$ and set $I$. 

A function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ is **differentiable at a subset** $S \subseteq I$ with injection $j:S \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if it has a function $\frac{d f}{d x}:S \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all Archimedean ordered Artinian local $K$-algebras $A$ with ring homomorphism $h:K \to A$ and [[nilradical]] $D$ such that for all $\epsilon \in D$, $\epsilon^2 = 0$, for all nilpotent elements $\epsilon \in D$,
$$f_A(h(j(a)) + \epsilon) = h(j(a)) + h\left(\frac{d f}{d x}(a)\right) \epsilon$$ 

A function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ is **differentiable at an element** $a \in I$ if it is differentiable at the [[singleton subset]] $\{a\}$, and a function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ is **differentiable** if it is differentiable at the [[improper subset]] of $I$. 

### From a Cartesian space to the real numbers

+-- {: .num_defn #DerivativeOfFunctionFromRnToR}
###### Definition
**(differentiation of real-valued functions on Cartesian space)**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be an [[open subset]].

Then a [[function]] $f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called  **differentiable** at $x\in U$ 
if there exists a [[linear map]] $d f_x : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the following [[limit of a sequence|limit]]
exists as $h$ approaches zero "from all directions at once":

$$ 
  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} = 0. 
$$

This means that for all $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$ there exists an [[open subset]] $V\subseteq U$ containing $x$ such that whenever $x+h\in V$ we have $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} \lt \epsilon$.

We say that $f$ is __differentiable on__ a [[subset]] $I$ of $U$ if $f$ is differentiable at every $x\in I$, and __differentiable__ (tout court) if $f$ is differentiable on all of $U$. We say that $f$ is **continuously differentiable** if it is differentiable and 
$d f$ is a [[continuous function]].

The map $d f_x$ is called the **derivative** or **differential of $f$ at $x$**.

###### Remark
**(Notation and Terminology)**

If $n=1$, as in classical one-variable calculus, then $d f_x$ in def. \ref{DerivativeOfFunctionFromRnToR} may be identified 
with a [[real number]], and that number is also called the derivative of $f$ at $x$ and often written $f'(x)$.  (In that case, the notation $d f$ is generally still reserved for the corresponding linear map, with its input denoted by $d x$, so that we have $d f = f'(x) d x$.)

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(equivalent formulation)**

An equivalent way to state def. \ref{DerivativeOfFunctionFromRnToR} is to say that
$$ f(x+h) = f(x) + d f_x(h) + E(h){\Vert h\Vert} $$
where $E$ is a function such that $\lim_{h\to 0}E(h) = 0$.  This is easy to see; just let $E(h) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert}$.

Another equivalent way to say it is that
$$ f(x+h) = f(x) + d f_x(h) + E_1(h) h_1 + \cdots + E_n(h) h_n $$
where $E_i$ are functions such that $\lim_{h\to 0}E_i(h) = 0$.  For if this is true, then $E(h) = \frac{1}{\Vert h\Vert}(E_1(h) h_1 + \cdots + E_n(h) h_n)$ satisfies the previous definition.  Conversely, if the previous definition holds, then defining $E_i(h) = \frac{h_i}{\Vert h \Vert} E(h)$ satisfies this definition.

### Partial and directional derivatives



A weaker notion of differentiability is the following: 

+-- {: .num_defn #DirectionalDerivative}
###### Definition
**([[partial derivative|directional derivative]])**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n $ an [[open subset]].

Then a [[function]] $f \colon U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is said to have **directional derivative**
in the direction of $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ at $x\in U$ if the [[limit of a sequence|limit]]

$$ 
  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h v)- f(x)}{h}
$$


exists. Here $h$ is just a real number.  

=--

Historically, the term 'directional derivative' was reserved for when $v$ is a [[unit vector]] (or divide the derivative above by $\|v\|$), but the general concept involves less structure and is more important but has no other established name.  If $v$ is a standard basis vector $e_i$, then the directional derivative is called a **[[partial derivative]]** with respect to the corresponding coordinate, and often written $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}$ or $f_{x_i}$.

If $f$ is differentiable at $x$ in the sense of def. \ref{DerivativeOfFunctionFromRnToR}, then $d f_x(v)$ is its directional derivative along $v$.  In particular, the coordinates of $d f_x$ are the partial derivatives of $f$.

In general, $f$ may have all partial derivatives, and even all directional derivatives, without being differentiable; 
see the examples [below](#DifferentiabilityOpposedToPartialDifferentiability).  However, if $f$ has all partial derivatives and they are *continuous* as functions of $x$, then in fact $f$ is differentiable (and indeed continuously differentiable).

###### Definition
**(differentiation of functions between Cartesian spaces)**

Let $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ be an [[open subset]]. 

Then a [[function]] $f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ is _differentiable_

is differentiable in the sense of def. \ref{DerivativeOfFunctionFromRnToR}.  

In this case, the derivatives $d f_i \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ of the $f_i$ assemble into a linear map

## Higher differentiability

### Iterated differentiability

For $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ an [[open subset]] and  $f \;\colon\; U\to \mathbb{R}^m$ a differentiable function (def. \ref{DerivativeOfFunctionFromRnToR}), we may regard its differential $d f$ as a function from a subset of $U$ (the points where $f$ is differentiable) to the space $L(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m)$ of [[linear maps]].  Since $L(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m) \cong \mathbb{R}^{n m}$ is again a Cartesian space, we may then ask whether $d f$ is differentiable.

We can then iterate, obtaining the following hierarchy of differentiability.  Because iterated differentiability by itself is not very useful, and a differentiable map is necessarily continuous, one generally includes continuity of the last assumed derivatives.

* The map $f$ is __continuous__ or __$C^0$__ if it is a [[continuous map]] between underlying [[topological spaces]].  We begin with this since a differentiable map is necessarily continuous.

* The map $f$ is __continuously differentiable__ or __$C^1$__ on $U$ if it is differentiable at all points of $U$ and the resulting map $d f$ is [[continuous map|continuous]].  (At this point, if we generalize to infinite-dimensional spaces, we get a variety of notions of when the differential is 'continuous'; see [[continuously differentiable map]] for discussion.)

* The map $f$ is __twice differentiable__ if it is differentiable and its derivative $d f$ is differentiable.  A twice differentiable map must be continuously differentiable.  Similarly, $f$ is __twice continuously differentiable__ or __$C^2$__ if it is twice differentiable and the second derivative $d d f$ is continuous.

* By [[recursion]], $f$ is __$n + 1$ times differentiable__ if $f$ is $n$ times differentiable and the $n$th derivative of $f$ is differentiable.  Similarly, $f$ is __$n$ times continuously differentiable__ or __$C^n$__ if $f$ is $n$ times differentiable and the $n$th derivative of $f$ is continuous.

* The map $f$ is __[[smooth map|smooth]]__ or __infinitely differentiable__ or __$C^\infty$__ if it is $n$ times differentiable for all $n$, or equivalently if it is $C^n$ for all $n$.  (There is no difference between infinite differentiability and infinite continuous differentiability.)  One may also define this notion [[coinductive definition|coinductively]]: $f$ is infinitely differentiable if it is differentiable and its derivative $d f$ is infinitely differentiable.

* One step higher, we may ask whether $f$ is [[analytic function|analytic]] or $C^\omega$.


### Uniform differentiability

Note that $f$ is differentiable on a set $U$ iff there is a function $f'$ on $U$ (necessarily unique, assuming that $U$ has no [[isolated points]]) such that

$$ \forall\, \epsilon \gt 0,\; \forall\, x \in U,\; \exists\, \delta \gt 0,\; \forall\, y \in U,\; {|{y - x}|} \lt \delta \;\Rightarrow\; {|{f(y) - f(x) - f'(x)(y - x)}|} \lt \epsilon \,{|{y - x}|} .$$

Reverse quantifiers, and $f$ is __uniformly differentiable__ on $U$ iff there is a function $f'$ on $U$ such that

$$ \forall\, \epsilon \gt 0,\; \exists\, \delta \gt 0,\; \forall\, x \in U,\; \forall\, y \in U,\; {|{y - x}|} \lt \delta \;\Rightarrow\; {|{f(y) - f(x) - f'(x)(y - x)}|} \lt \epsilon \,{|{y - x}|}.$$

In [[classical mathematics]], $f$ is uniformly differentiable if and only if $f$ is differentiable and its derivative $f'$ is [[uniformly continuous map|uniformly continuous]]; in other words, $f$ is uniformly differentiable iff $f$ is _uniformly-continuously differentiable_.  The same is true in [[constructive mathematics]] as long as one assumes [[dependent choice]]. In the absence of dependent choice, however, the argument only goes one way, and uniform differentiability is stronger.  Furthermore, just as pointwise continuity is not as well behaved constructively as uniform continuity, so pointwise differentiability is not as well behaved constructively as uniform differentiability.  For this reason, uniform differentiability is particularly important in constructive mathematics.

In addition, one could talk about **locally uniform differentiablilty**, which is a continuously differentiable function on a set $U$ which is uniformly differentiable on every closed and bounded subset $V \subseteq U$. 

### Symmetry of higher derivatives {#symmetry}

If $f:U\to \mathbb{R}^m$ is twice differentiable with $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, its second derivative
$$d(d f) : U \to L(\mathbb{R}^n,L(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m)) \cong Bilin(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^m)$$
is a function from $U$ into the space of [[bilinear maps]] from $\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$.

+-- {: .num_theorem #symmetrythm}
###### Theorem
**(Symmetry of higher derivatives)**.
If $f:U\to \mathbb{R}^m$ is twice differentiable, then its second derivative $d(d f)$ lands in the space of *symmetric* bilinear maps, i.e. for any $x\in U$ and $v,w\in \mathbb{R}^n$ we have
$$ d(d f)_x(v,w) = d(d f)_x(w,v). $$
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
It suffices to assume $m=1$; otherwise we just consider it componentwise.  Define a function $g:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ by
$$ g(\xi) = f(x+\xi v+w) - f(x+\xi v). $$
Then by the chain rule, $g$ is differentiable and
$$
\begin{aligned}
  g'(\xi) &= d f_{x+\xi v+w}(v) -  d f_{x+\xi v}(v)\\
  &= \Big(d f_{x+\xi v+w}(v) - d f_{x}(v)\Big) - \Big(d f_{x+\xi v}(v) - d f_x(v)\Big)\\
  &= d(d f)_{x}(v,\xi v + w) + E_1 |v|\,|\xi v + w| - d(d f)_x(v,\xi v) - E_2 |v|\,|\xi v|\\
  &= d(d f)_x(v,w) + E |v|\, (|v|+|w|)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $E_1, E_2, E \to 0$ as $(v,w)\to 0$.  Now the [[mean value theorem]] tells us that for some $\xi\in(0,1)$ we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
  f(x+v+w) - f(x+v) - f(x+w) + f(x)
  &= g(1) - g(0)\\
  &= g'(\xi)\\
  &= d(d f)_x(v,w) + E (|v|+|w|)^2.
\end{aligned}
$$
But the "second-order difference" $f(x+v+w) - f(x+v) - f(x+w) + f(x)$ is manifestly symmetric in $v$ and $w$, so we have
$$ d(d f)_x(v,w) - d(d f)_x(w,v) = E (|v|+|w|)^2 $$
where $\lim_{(v,w)\to 0} E = 0$.  But bilinearity of the LHS then implies that it is identically zero.
=--

The components of the bilinear map $d(d f)$ are the second-order partial derivatives $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}$ of $f$.  Thus, this theorem says that if $f$ is twice differentiable, then the *mixed partials* are equal,
$$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j \partial x_i}.$$

The second-order partial derivatives may *exist* without the mixed partials being equal; see below for a counterexample.  However, the theorem shows that if we require $f$ to actually be twice differentiable rather than merely having second-order partial derivatives, then this cannot happen.

In particular, we have the following corollary, which is more commonly found in textbooks.

+-- {: .num_cor #symmetrycontcor}
###### Corollary
**(Symmetry of continuous higher derivatives)**.
If $f$ has first and second-order partial derivatives, and the latter are continuous in a neighborhood of $x$, then the mixed partial derivatives are equal,
$$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j \partial x_i}.$$
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Continuity of the second-order partials implies that the first-order partials are differentiable, and hence so is the differential $d f$.

### A direct definition of the second derivative

Note that the proof of the theorem implies that if $f$ is twice differentiable at $x$, then there exists a bilinear map $\partial^2 f_x : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ such that

$$f(x+v+w) - f(x+v) - f(x+w) + f(x) = \partial^2 f_x(v,w) + E(v,w) ({|v|+|w|})^2 $$

where $\lim_{v,w\to 0} E(v,w) = 0$.  This is a condition that makes sense as a condition on an arbitrary $f$ without assuming differentiability. and if it holds, then the bilinear map $\partial^2 f_x$ must be symmetric.

Moreover, as explained [here](http://mathoverflow.net/a/165733/49), if $f$ is differentiable in a neighborhood of $x$ and satisfies this condition at $x$, then it is in fact twice differentiable at $x$.  To see this, it suffices to show that each coordinate of $d f$ is differentiable, so let $w=\delta e_i$, with $e_i$ a unit basis vector and $\delta$ a real number $\neq 0$.  Then we have

$$ E(v,\delta e_i) = \frac{f(x+v+\delta e_i) - f(x+v) - f(x+\delta e_i) + f(x) - \partial^2 f_x(v,\delta w)}{{|v|}{\delta}}$$

Taking the limit as $\delta\to 0$ and using differentiability of $f$ at $x$ and $x+v$ (for sufficiently small $v$), we get

$$ \lim_{\delta \to 0} E(v,\delta e_i) = \frac{d f_{x+v}(e_i) - d f_x(e_i) - \partial^2 f_x(v,e_i)}{{|v|}}. $$

Now take the limit as $v\to 0$; on the left we get $0$ by assumption, so the function $y\mapsto d f_y(e_i)$ is differentiable at $x$ with derivative $\partial^2 f_x(-,e_i)$.  Thus, $d f$ is differentiable at $x$.

On the other hand, this condition by itself does not even imply that $f$ is continuous.  For instance, if $f$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-linear map $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$, then the second-order difference $f(x+v+w) - f(x+v) - f(x+w) + f(x)$ is identically zero.


### Higher differentiability on tangent spaces and the chain rule

Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable.  Instead of asking whether $d f : U \to L(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R})$ is differentiable, we can ask whether its exponential transpose $d f : U\times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable.  (Note that $U\times \mathbb{R}^n$ is the [[tangent bundle]] of $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$.)  This amounts to asking that for $x\in U$ and $v\in \mathbb{R}^n$, we have
$$ d f_{x+w}(v+h) - d f_x(v) = d^2 f_{(x,v)}(w,h) + E(|w|+|h|) $$
for a linear map $d^2 f_{(x,v)}:\mathbb{R}^{2n} \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\lim_{(w,h)\to 0} E = 0$.  Setting $h=0$, we see that this implies that $d f : U \to L(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R})$ is differentiable, with differential $d(d f)_x = d^2 f_{(x,v)}(w,0)$ for any $v$.  And setting $w=0$, we obtain $d f_x(h) = d^2 f_{(x,v)}(0,h)$ for any $v$.  Thus, we can write
$$ d^2 f_{(x,v)}(w,h) = \partial^2 f_x(v,w) + d f_x(h) $$
where $\partial^2 f_x$ is the symmetric bilinear map from the previous section.  Conversely, if $f$ is twice differentiable, then using linearity and continuity of $d f$ it is easy to see that the above condition holds.

Therefore, these two kinds of twice-differentiability of $f$ are equivalent as *conditions* on $f$, but the resulting *second differential* is different.  In the second case, we get

$$d^2f = \partial^2 f + d f = \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} d x_i \, d x_j + \sum_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} d^2 x_i. $$

rather than merely the first term $\sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} d x_i \, d x_j$.  There are two advantages to the second approach (asking that $d f : U\times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable).

Firstly, we can reformulate it in terms of $f$ by asking that there exists a linear map $d f_x : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ and a bilinear map $\partial^2 f_x : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ such that

$$f(x+v+w+h) - f(x+v) - f(x+w) + f(x) = \partial^2 f_x(v,w) + d f_x(h) + E(v,w,h) \sqrt{{|v|}^2{|w|}^2 + {|h|}^2}.$$

where $\lim_{v,w,h \to 0} E(v,w,h) = 0$.  This holds if $f$ is twice differentiable, for then we can write
$$
\begin{aligned}
  f(x+v+w+h) &= f(x+v+w) + d f_{x+v+w}(h) + E {|h|}\\
  &= f(x+v+w) + d f_x(h) + d(d f)_x(v+w,h) + E {|v+w|}{|h|} + E{|h|}
\end{aligned}
$$
and $d(d f)_x(v+w,h)$ can also be incorporated into the error term.  Of course, setting $h=0$ we obtain the characterization of twice-differentiability from the previous section.  But setting $v=w=0$, we find that $f$ is differentiable at $x$ with derivative $d f_x$.  So here we have a direct characterization of the second derivative which also implies that the first derivative exists (although it seems that it doesn't imply differentiability in a neighborhood of $x$, so that the resulting "second derivative" may not actually be the derivative of the first derivative).

Secondly, the virtue of a second differential incorporating the first derivatives is that like the first differential $d f$, but unlike the bilinear map $\partial^2 f$, it satisfies [[Cauchy's invariant rule]].  This means that we can express the [[chain rule]] for second differentials of composite maps simply by substitution: if $y = f(u)$ and $u = g(x)$, then finding $d^2 y$ in terms of $d u$ and $d^2 u$, and $d u$ and $d^2 u$ in terms of $d x$ and $d^2 x$, and substituting, gives the correct expression for $d^2 y$ in terms of $d x$ and $d^2 x$.

In fact, this can be proven using the above direct characterization of the second differential, in essentially exactly the same way that we prove the ordinary chain rule for first derivatives.  We sketch the proof, omitting the explicit error terms.  We can write

$$g(f(x+v+w+h)) - g(f(x+v)) - g(f(x+w)) + g(f(x)) $$

as

$$ g(f(x) + v' + w' + h') - g(f(x) + v') - g(f(x) + w') + g(f(x)) $$

where $v' = f(x+v) - f(x)$ and $w' = f(x+w) - f(x)$ and $h' = f(x+v+w+h) - f(x+v) - f(x+w) + f(x)$.  Now by extra-strong twice differentiability of $g$, this is approximately equal to

$$ \partial^2 g_{f(x)}(v',w') + d g_{f(x)}(h'). $$

But by differentiability of $f$, we have $v' \approx d f_x(v)$ and $w' \approx d f_x(w)$, while by extra-strong twice differentiability of $f$ we have $h' \approx \partial^2 f_x(v,w) + d f_x(h)$.  Thus, we obtain approximately

$$ \partial^2 g_{f(x)}(d f_x(v), d f_x(w)) + d g_{f(x)}(\partial^2 f_x(v,w) + d f_x(h)) $$

which is exactly what we would get by substitution.


### For maps between manifolds

If $X$ and $Y$ are $C^k$-[[differentiable manifolds]], then we may define what it means for a map $f:X\to Y$ to be $n$ times differentiable, or $C^n$, for any $n\le k$, by asking that it yield such a map when restricted to any charts.  The most common case is when $X$ and $Y$ are smooth (infinitely differentiable) manifolds, so that we can define $C^n$ functions between them for all $n\le \infty$.  (Analytic manifolds, which are necessary in order to define analyticity of $f$, are somewhat rarer.)

A differentiable map between manifolds induces a map between their [[tangent bundles]] $d f : T X \to T Y$; this operation extends to a [[functor]] from $C^{k+1}$ manifolds and $C^{k+1}$ maps to $C^k$ manifolds and $C^k$ maps.  See [[differentiation]] for more.


## Examples and non-examples

### Differentiability versus partial differentiability
 {#DifferentiabilityOpposedToPartialDifferentiability}

The function $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by

$$ f(x,y) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{y^3}{x^2+y^2} &\quad (x,y) \neq (0,0)\\
  0 &\quad (x,y) = (0,0)
\end{cases}
$$

is continuous everywhere, and has directional derivatives (def. \ref{DirectionalDerivative}) at $(0,0)$ in all directions, but is not differentiable at $(0,0)$ in the sense of def. \ref{DerivativeOfFunctionFromRnToR}.  Note that the (unnormalized) directional derivative along the vector $(a,b)$ is $\frac{b^3}{a^2+b^2}$, which is not linear.

One may wonder whether existence of a linear map $d f_x$ is enough, but this is also not the case.  The function $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by

$$ f(x,y) = \begin{cases} \frac{y^3}{x} &\quad x\neq 0\\ 0 &\quad x=0 \end{cases} $$

has all directional derivatives at $(0,0)$ equaling $0$, so that in particular there is a linear map $d f_{(0,0)}$ whose values are the directional derivatives.  But it is not differentiable at $(0,0)$; in fact, it is not even continuous at $(0,0)$.  (Thus it also provides an example of a discontinuous function which has all directional derivatives.)

The discontinuity kind of gives this last one away; maybe a continuous function with all directional derivatives must be differentiable?  But no, because if $W$ is a [[Weierstrass function]] (continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere) from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with [[periodic function|period]] $2\pi$, and $\operatorname{atan2}$ is a $2$-argument [[arctangent]] function from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$ (so that $\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \,\sin\,\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = y$ and $\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \,\cos\,\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = x$ for all $x$ and $y$), then set

$$ f(x,y) = (x^2 + y^2) W(\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)) .$$

Then $f$ is, like $W$, continuous everywhere and differentiable nowhere, yet the directional derivatives through the origin are all $0$.  There are further examples (including one that is analytic except at the origin) at [Math StackExchange question 1497043](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1497043/is-there-a-function-thats-continuous-and-has-all-directional-derivatives-as-a-l).


### Differentiability versus continuous and higher differentiability

Let $k$ be a [[natural number]], and consider the function
$$ f_k(x) \coloneqq x^k \sin(1/x) $$
from the [[real line]] to itself, with $f(0) \coloneqq 0$.  Away from $0$, $f_k$ is smooth (even analytic); but at $0$, $f_0$ is not continuous, $f_1$ is continuous but not differentiable, $f_2$ is differentiable but not continuously differentiable, and so on:

*  If $k = 2 n$ is even, then $f_k$ is differentiable $n$ times but not continuously differentiable $n$ times;
*  If $k = 2 n + 1$ is odd, then $f_k$ is continuously differentiable $n$ times but not differentiable $n + 1$ times.

Similarly, in two dimensions we can consider functions such as
$$ f(x,y) = (x^2+y^2)\sin(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}).$$
together with $f(0,0) = 0$.  This is smooth away from $0$, and once differentiable at $0$, even in the strong sense that it is well-approximated by a linear function near $0$.  However, its derivative is not continuous at $0$.  In particular, this shows that the converse of the theorem "if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous at a point, then the function is differentiable there" fails, even in higher dimensions.

Uniform differentiability is stronger than continuous differentiability but independent of twice differentiability.  For an example that is uniformly differentiable but not twice differentiable, use $f_3$ again.  For an example that that is twice differentiable (and hence continuously differentiable) but not uniformly differentiable, use $x \mapsto x^3$.  However, on a [[compact set|compact]] domain, any continuously differentiable function (and a fortiori any twice differentiable function) must be uniformly continuous (at least in [[classical mathematics|classical]] and [[intuitionistic mathematics]]).


### Symmetry of the second partial derivatives

The function $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by

$$ f(x,y) = \frac{x y (x^2-y^2)}{x^2+y^2}$$

plus $f(0,0) = 0$, has partial derivatives $\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x \partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y \partial x}$ that both exist but are not equal at $(0,0)$ (nor are they continuous at $(0,0)$).  Therefore, by the theorem proven above, it is not twice differentiable at $(0,0)$.


### Twice differentiability versus quadratic approximation

While differentiability means approximability by a linear function, twice differentiability does *not* mean approximability by a quadratic function.  For example, the function

$$ f(x) = x^3 \sin(1/x) $$

(with $f(0) =0$, to make it continuous there) is not twice differentiable at $x=0$, but it is well-approximated by the quadratic polynomial $p(x) = 0$ in the sense that their difference is $o(x^2)$ as $x\to 0$.  Even worse, the function

$$ f(x) = e^{-1/x^2} \sin(e^{1/x^2}) $$

is not twice differentiable at $x=0$, but it is well-approximated by a polynomial of *any* finite degree $n$ (namely, the zero polynomial), in the sense that their difference is $o(x^n)$ as $x\to 0$.

In some contexts, it is useful to say that functions such as these have "pointwise second derivatives".  More precisely, we say that a function $f$ has a **pointwise $k^{th}$ derivative** at $a$ if it is continuous at $a$ and there exists a polynomial $p$ of degree $k$ such that

$$ \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x) - p(x)}{(x-a)^k} = 0. $$

(We have to state continuity explicitly in order to match the usual notion of differentiability when $k = 1$, since nothing in this limit constrains the value of $f(a)$.)  In this case, the pointwise $k^{th}$ derivative is $f^{(k)}_{pt}(a) = p^{(k)}(a)$ (and it follows that all lower-order pointwise derivatives match as well).  Thus we would say that while $f(x) = x^3 \sin(1/x)$ does not have a second derivative at $0$, it does have a *pointwise* second derivative at $0$, and $f_{pt}''(0) = 0$.  Similarly, $e^{-1/x^2} \sin(e^{1/x^2})$ is pointwise smooth.  See e.g. [this MSE answer](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/160383/91608).

The polynomial $p$ may be thought of as the $k$th-order [[Taylor polynomial]] of $f$ at $a$, and the limit above is Taylor's theorem with the Peano remainder.  (Thus the subscript $pt$ can be thought of as standing for &#8216;Peano--Taylor&#8217; as well as for &#8216;pointwise&#8217;.)  Note that while $k$-times pointwise differentiability is weaker than $k$-times differentiability for $k \gt 1$ and equivalent for $k = 1$, it is stronger for $k = 0$ (since even $0$-times pointwise differentiability requires continuity).


### The second derivative as a quadratic form

In the definition of strong twice-differentiability, we cannot replace the symmetric [[bilinear map]] $\partial^2 f_x(v,w)$ by the corresponding [[quadratic form]] $Q_x(v) = \partial^2f_x(v,v)$.  In other words, if we suppose that

$$f(x+2v) - 2 f(x+v) + f(x) = Q_x(v) + E(v) {|v|}^2 $$

where $\lim_{v\to 0} E(v) = 0$, for some quadratic form $Q_x$, it does not follow that $f$ is twice differentiable at $x$, even in one dimension.  The same old counterexample

$$ f(x) = x^3 \sin(1/x) $$

(with $f(0)=0$) works: we have

$$f(0+2v) - 2 f(0+v) + f(0)= 2v^3(4\sin(\frac{1}{2v}) - \sin(\frac{1}{v}))$$

so $E(v) = v (4\sin(\frac{1}{2v}) - \sin(\frac{1}{v})) \to 0$.

# The Mean Value Theorem
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea {#idea}

The motivating idea of the [[derivative]] in [[differential calculus]] is that it is approximated by a [[ratio]] of differences.  We may also say that an instantaneous rate of change is approximated by an average rate of change.  The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) reverses this, and says that any average rate of change is equal to some instantaneous rate of change, if certain differentiability conditions are met.

The name comes from the fact that, due to the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], an average rate of change over an [[interval]] may be viewed as an average (or [[mean]]) of the instantaneous rates of change along the interval.  Thus, the theorem states that the mean value of the derivative on an interval is attained somewhere in that interval.


## Statements {#statement}

There are traditionally three versions of increasing generality, although even the most general version is implicit in the most specific version (requiring only a linear coordinate transformation).

+-- {: .num_theorem #rolle}
###### Rolle\'s Theorem

Suppose that $a \lt b$ are [[real numbers]] and $f$ is a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[function]] on $[a,b]$.  If $f$ is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on the [[interior]] $]{a,b}[$, and if $f(a) = f(b)$, then for some $c \in {]{a,b}[}$,
$$ f'(c) = 0 .$$
=--

###### Lagrange\'s Theorem

Suppose that $a \lt b$ are [[real numbers]] and $f$ is a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[function]] on $[a,b]$.  If $f$ is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on the [[interior]] $]{a,b}[$, then for some $c \in {]{a,b}[}$,
$$ f'(c) = \frac {f(b) - f(a)} {b - a} ,$$
or equivalently
$$ f'(c) (b - a) = f(b) - f(a) .$$
=--

+-- {: .num_theorem #cauchy}
###### Cauchy\'s Theorem

Suppose that $a \lt b$ are [[real numbers]] and $f$ and $g$ are [[continuous map|continuous]] real-valued [[functions]] on $[a,b]$.  If $f$ and $g$ are [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on the interior $]{a,b}[$, then for some $c \in {]{a,b}[}$,
$$ f'(c) (g(b) - g(a)) = g'(c) (f(b) - f(a)) ;$$
assuming that $f'$ and $g'$ are never simultaneously zero in $]{a,b}[$ and that $(f(a),g(a)) \neq (f(b),g(b))$, then for some $c \in {]{a,b}[}$,
$$ \frac {f'(c)} {g'(c)} = \frac {f(b) - f(a)} {g(b) - g(a)} ,$$
where either side of this equation is allowed to be interpreted as $\infty$ in case it is division by zero (necessarily with a nonzero dividend under these conditions); or perhaps better, an equality of [[ratio]]s:
$$ f'(c) : g'(c) :: f(b) - f(a) : g(b) - g(a) .$$
=--

If we write $u$ for $f(x)$ and $v$ for $g(x)$, then this last version states that
$$ \left.{\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}v}}\right|_{x=c} = \left.{\frac{\Delta{u}}{\Delta{v}}}\right|_{x=a}^b .$$
Compare this to the definition
$$ \left.{\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}v}}\right|_{x=a} \coloneqq \lim_{b\to{a}} \left.{\frac{\Delta{u}}{\Delta{v}}}\right|_{x=a}^b $$
(although this is really only a *definition* when $v$ is $x$, which reduces Cauchy\'s theorem to Lagrange\'s).


## Naming

Rolle\'s theorem is usually called just 'Rolle\'s' theorem, being the only result attributed today to [[Michel Rolle]]; but Lagrange\'s and Cauchy\'s theorems must be called 'mean value' theorems, as [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] and [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] did far more.  By default, the term 'Mean Value Theorem' usually refers to Lagrange\'s theorem.  (But neither Rolle nor Lagrange proved their theorem in the general case; the first proofs of all of them are due to Cauchy in 1823, a decade after Lagrange\'s death and more than a century after Rolle\'s death.)


## Mean-value inequalities

One consequence of these mean-value theorems if that if the relevant derivatives (or ratios of derivatives) are bounded, then the corresponding differences (or ratios of differences) will also be bounded.  We state this for Lagrange\'s theorem, although there are versions that correspond more to Rolle\'s or Cauchy\'s.

+-- {: .num_theorem #inequality}
###### The Mean-Value Inequality aka the Law of Bounded Change

Suppose that $a \lt b$ are [[real numbers]] and $f$ is a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[function]] on $[a,b]$.  If $f$ is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on the [[interior]] $]{a,b}[$, and we have $m \leq f' \leq M$ on $]{a,b}[$ for some constants $m$ and $M$, then
$$ m \leq \frac {f(b) - f(a)} {b - a} \leq M .$$
A slightly weaker statement is
$$ {|{f(b) - f(a)}|} \leq {|{b - a}|} \, \sup_{]{a,b}[} {|{f'}|} ,$$
which is true even if the derivative is unbounded (in which case the right-hand side is [[infinity|infinite]]).
=--

In [[constructive mathematics]], the mean-value theorems generally cannot be proved, since it may be impossible to find the value $c$ (although some variations with stronger hypotheses or weaker conclusions can often be proved, similarly to the [[Intermediate-Value Theorem]]).  However, the mean-value inequality is true in constructive mathematics, as long as $f$ is [[uniformly differentiable map|uniformly differentiable]] on every closed subinterval of $]{a,b}[$ (as is typical).

The second form of the mean-value inequality shows the relationship of differentiability to [[Lipschitz continuity]]: a continuous function on an interval with bounded derivative on the interior of the interval is Lipschitz continuous on that interval (and the [[supremum]] of the [[absolute value]] of the [[derivative]] is the [[Lipschitz constant]]).

## Definition

### As partial functions on a field

If $k$ is a [[field]], given the [[polynomial ring]] $k[x]$, there is a canonical [[ring homomorphism]] $j:k[x] \to (k \to k)$ which sends [[constant function|constant]] [[polynomials]] in $k[x]$ to [[constant functions]] in $k \to k$, and the [[generator]] $x \in k[x]$ to the [[identity function]] $id_k$, where $k \to k$ is the [[function algebra]] on $k$. 

There is a function 
$$i:k(x) \to \{A \in Ob(Part(k)) \vert Hom(A, k)\}$$
from the field of [[rational expression]] to the set of all [[partial functions]] in the [[category of partial functions]] $Part(k)$, where the [[function algebra]] $k \to k$ is the [[endomorphism]] $k$-algebra on the [[improper subset]] $k$. The function $i$ is defined as follows: given two polynomials $p, q \in k[x]$ where $q \neq 0$, for all $x \in \{a \in k | q(a) \neq 0\}$
$$i\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)(x) \coloneqq \frac{j(p)(x)}{j(q)(x)}$$
where for $x \in k$ and $y \in k$
$$\frac{x}{y}$$
is the [[division]] of $x$ by $y$ in $k$, and for $r \in k(x)$ and $s \in k(x)$, 
$$\frac{r}{s}$$
is the [[division]] of $r$ by $s$ in $k(x)$. A **rational function** $f$ is an [[element]] of the [[image]] of $i$, $f \in \im(i)$. 

### As functions on the projective line

It is perhaps more illuminating to think of this partial function (with domain $D$) as coming from a (total) function $[p/q]: \mathbb{P}^1(k) \to \mathbb{P}^1(k)$ on the [[projective line]], where we have inclusion functions $i: k \to \mathbb{P}^1(k)$ and the partial function is given by the pair of projection maps in the [[pullback]] 

$$\array{
D & \to & k \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow_\mathrlap{i} \\ 
k & \underset{[p/q] \circ i}{\to} & \mathbb{P}^1(k) 
}$$ 

It should also be noticed that such endofunctions $[p/q]$ on $\mathbb{P}^1(k)$ are closed under composition (except that special provision must be made for the constant function valued at $\infty$, which corresponds to the "fraction" $1/0$). 

## Properties

### Rational functions on a field do not form a field

This comes from the fact that the reciprocal function is not a multiplicative inverse of the identity function $f(x) = \frac{x}{x} \neq 1$, due to the fact that $f(x)$ is undefined at $0$, and thus has a different domain than the constant function $1$, which is the multiplicative unit.

# Logarithms
* table of contents

## Idea

Classically, a logarithm is a [[partial function|partially-defined]] [[smooth map|smooth]] [[homomorphism]] from a multiplicative [[group]] of [[number]]s to an additive group of numbers.  As such, it is a [[local section]] of an [[exponential map]].  As exponential maps can be generalised to [[Lie groups]], so can logarithms.


## Definitions

### Logarithms of real numbers

Consider the [[field]] of [[real numbers]]; these numbers form a [[Lie group]] under addition (which we will call simply $\mathbb{R}$), while the nonzero numbers form a Lie group under multiplication (which we will call $\mathbb{R}^*$).  The multiplicative group has two [[connected components]]; we will focus attention on the [[identity component]] (which we will call $\mathbb{R}^+$), consisting of the positive numbers.

The Lie groups $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^+$ are in fact [[isomorphic]].  In fact, there is one isomorphism for each positive real number $b$ other than $1$; this number $b$ is called the __base__.  Fixing a base, the map from $\mathbb{R}^+$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is called the __real logarithm with base $b$__, written $x \mapsto \log_b x$; the map from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^+$ is the __real [[exponential map]] with base $b$__, written $x \mapsto b^x$.

The real logarithms are handily defined using the [[Riemann integral]] of the [[reciprocal]] as follows:
\[ \label{integrals} \array {
   \ln x & \coloneqq \int_1^x \frac{1}{t} \,\mathrm{d}t ;\\
   \log_b x & \coloneqq \frac{\ln x}{\ln b} .\\
} \]
Note that $\ln$ is itself a logarithm, the __natural logarithm__, whose base is $\mathrm{e} = 2.71828182845\ldots$.  (The exponential map may similarly be defined as an infinite series, but I\'ll leave that for its own article.)


### Logarithms of complex numbers

Now consider the [[field]] of [[complex numbers]]; these also form a [[Lie group]] under addition (which we call $\mathbb{C}$), while the nonzero numbers form a Lie group under multiplication (which we call $\mathbb{C}^*$).  Now the multiplicative group is [[connected space|connected]], so we would like to use all of it.

However, $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C}^*$ are *not* [[isomorphic]]. Indeed, the multiplication map 

$$\mathbb{R}^* \times S^1 \to \mathbb{C}^*$$ 

exhibits $\mathbb{C}^*$ as a [[biproduct]] of $\mathbb{R}^*$ and the [[circle group]] $S^1$, so that homomorphisms $\mathbb{C}^* \to \mathbb{C}$ are given by pairs of homomorphisms $f \colon \mathbb{R}^* \to \mathbb{C}$, $g \colon S^1 \to \mathbb{C}$. But every homomorphisms $g \colon S^1 \to \mathbb{C}$ is trivial: the restriction of $g$ to the [[torsion subgroup]] of $S^1$ is trivial since $\mathbb{C}$ is torsionfree, and since the torsion subgroup is dense in $S^1$, any Lie group homomorphism $S^1 \to \mathbb{C}$ must also be trivial. Therefore, every homomorphism $h \colon \mathbb{C}^* \to \mathbb{C}$ factors through the projection $\mathbb{C}^* \to \mathbb{R}^*$. It quickly follows that no such $h$ can be injective, nor can such $h$ be surjective. 

Taking advantage of biproduct representations $\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R} \oplus \mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}^* \cong \mathbb{R}^* \oplus S^1$, we can classify homomorphisms from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{C}^*$. Each is given by a 4-tuple of real numbers $(a, b, c, d)$: 

$$\phi_{a, b, c, d}(x + i y) = e^{a x} e^{i b x} e^{c y} e^{i d y}.$$ 

The cases where $a = d$, $b = -c$ correspond to those homomorphisms that are [[holomorphic functions]] (i.e., that satisfy the [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]]). Putting $w = a + b i$, we have 

$$\phi_{a, b, -b, a}(z) = e^{w z}$$ 

with one such homomorphism for each complex number $w$, and these homomorphisms are [[surjections]] whenever $w \ne 0$. (N.B.: these homomorphisms are not uniquely determined by their values at $z = 1$, since we have $e^w = e^{w'}$ whenever $w - w'$ is an integer multiple of $2 \pi i$, and yet the homomorphisms $z \mapsto e^{w z}$ and $z \mapsto e^{w' z}$ will be different unless $w = w'$.) 

So we have these surjections (the __complex [[exponential map]]__ $z \mapsto e^{w z}$, for $w \ne 0$), which are [[regular epimorphisms]] but not [[split epimorphisms]].  However, while they have no [[sections]] (being not split), they have quite a few [[local sections]], and the [[domains]] of the [[maximal local sections]] are precisely the [[connected space|connected]] [[simply connected space|simply connected]] [[open subspace|open]] [[dense subspace|dense]] subspaces $R$ of $\mathbb{C}^*$.  A __complex logarithm with exponential base $w$ on $R$__ is this $R$-defined section of the complex exponential map $z \mapsto e^{w z}$. Supposing $R$ given, we denote this by $\log_{[w]}$ (but please note that in the context of real logarithms, this would ordinarily be denoted $\log_b$ where $b = e^w$). 

If $1 \in R$, then a complex natural logarithm on $R$ may be defined using the [[contour integral]] with the same formula (eq:integrals) as for the real natural logarithm.  We merely insist that the integral be done along a contour within the region $R$.  (Since $R$ is connected, there is such a contour; since $R$ is simply connected and $t \mapsto 1/t$ is [[holomorphic map|holomorphic]], the result is unique.)  Note that if $x \in \mathbb{R}^+ \subseteq R$, then the real and complex natural logarithms of $x$ will be equal. 

The natural exponential map is [[periodic function|periodic]] (with period $2 \pi \mathrm{i}$), and it is possible to add any multiple of this period to the natural logarithm of any $x \ne 1$ by suitably changing the region $R$.  We then obtain the most general notion of maximally-defined complex logarithm with any base by using the formulas
$$ \array {
   \ln x & \coloneqq C + \int_{\mathrm{e}^C}^x \frac{1}{t} \,\mathrm{d}t,\\
   \log_{[w]} x & \coloneqq \frac{\ln x}{w} .\\
} $$


### Logarithms and Lie groups

In the classical examples, the multiplicative groups $\mathbb{R}^+$ and $\mathbb{C}^*$ both [[Lie groups]].  The additive groups $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are also Lie groups, but they are more than this: they are [[Lie algebras]].  (The additive group of a Lie algebra is always a Lie group.  Actually, since these are [[abelian Lie algebras]], their Lie-algebra structure is easy to miss, but of course they are [[vector spaces]].)  And what\'s more, each additive group is *the* Lie algebra of the corresponding Lie group.

This generalises.  Given any [[Lie group]] $G$, let $\mathfrak{g}$ be its [[Lie algebra]].  Then we have an [[exponential map]] $\exp\colon \mathfrak{g} \to G$, which is [[surjection|surjective]] under certain conditions (most famously when $G$ is [[connected space|connected]] and [[compact space|compact]], but also in the classical cases, even though $G$ is not compact).  More generally, given any [[automorphism]] $\phi$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, we have a map $x \mapsto \exp(\phi(x))$, which is a [[homomorphism]] of Lie groups.  Any [[local section]] of this map may be called a __logarithm base $\phi$__ on $G$ (denoted $\log_{[\phi]}$ with the bracket as in the previous section); any local section of $\exp$ itself may be called a __natural logarithm__ on $G$.

$$
we get, for $n \in \mathbb{N}_+$:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{d^n}{d x^n} 
  ln(1 + x)
  &
  \;=\;
  \frac{d^{n-1}}{d x^{n-1}}
  \left(
    \frac{1}{1 + x}
  \right)
  \\
  &
  \;=\;
  (n-1)! \cdot (-1)^{n-1}
  \frac{1}{(1 + x)^{n-1}}
  \\
  &
  \;\xrightarrow{ x \to 0 }\; 
  (n-1)! \cdot (-1)^{n+1}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$
Plugging this into the defining equation on the left of (eq:MercatorTaylorSeriesForNaturalLogarithm) and using 
$$
  \frac{(n-1)!}{n!} = \frac{1}{n}
$$
yields the claim.

## Idea

The notion of _power object_ generalizes the notion of [[power set]] from the [[category]] [[Set]] to an arbitrary category with [[finite limit]]s.

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with [[finitely complete category|finite limits]]. A **power object** of an object $c \in C$ is 

* an [[object]] $\Omega^c$ 

* a [[monomorphism]] $\in_c \hookrightarrow c \times \Omega^c$

such that

* for every other object $d$ and every [[monomorphism]] $r \hookrightarrow c \times d$ there is a unique morphism
$\chi_r : d \to \Omega^c$ such that $r$ is the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    r &\to& \in_c
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    c \times d
    &\stackrel{Id_c \times \chi_r}{\to}&
    c \times \Omega^c
  }
$$

If $C$ may lack some finite limits, then we may weaken that condition as follows:

*  If $C$ has all [[pullbacks]] (but may lack products), then equip each of $\in_c$ and $r$ with a jointly monic pair of morphisms, one to $c$ and one to $\Omega^c$ or $d$, in place of the single monomorphism to the product of these targets; $r$ must then be the joint pullback

   $$ \array {
   & c          & \leftarrow    & r & \rightarrow & d &  \\
   Id_c & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & \chi_r \\
   & c          & \leftarrow      & \in_c      & \rightarrow       & \Omega^c & \\
   } $$

*  If $C$ may lack some pullbacks, then we simply require that the pullback that $r$ is to equal must exist.  But arguably we should require, if $\Omega^c$ is to be a power object, that this pullback exists for any given map $\chi: d \to \Omega^c$.

## Examples

* If $1$ is a [[terminal object]], then $\Omega^1$ is precisely a [[subobject classifier]].

* A power object in [[Set]] is precisely a [[power set]].

* A category with finite [[limits]] and power objects for all objects is precisely a [[topos]]. The power object $P A $ of any object $A$ in the topos is the [[exponential object]] $P A = \Omega^A$ into the [[subobject classifier]]. 

* See [[Trimble on ETCS I]] for the axiom of power sets in the elementary theory of the category of sets.

## Idea 

A _trigonometric function_ is one derived from the basic [[functions]] of [[trigonometry]], $\cos$, $\sin$ ([[cosine]] and [[sine]]), which themselves are the standard [[coordinate functions]] (equivalently: [[Cartesian product|product projections]] $pr_i$) of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^2$, [[restriction|restricted]] to the unit [[circle]]:

$$
  \array{
    & 
    && \mathbb{R}
    \\
    &
    &
    {}^{\mathllap{cos}}\nearrow
    & \big\uparrow{}^{ \mathrlap{pr_1} }
    \\
    \mathbb{R}
    \overset{exp}{\longrightarrow}
    &
    S^1 
    &\hookrightarrow&
    \mathbb{R}^2 
    &\simeq&
    \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}
    \\
    &
    & {}_{\mathllap{sin}}\searrow & \big\downarrow{}^{ \mathrlap{pr_2} }
    \\
    &
    && \mathbb{R}
  }
  \,,
$$

or rather the result of [[composition|composing]] these restrictions with an [[arc length]] parametrization $\mathbb{R} \overset{\exp}{\to} S^1$. They are also called _circular functions_. 

In elementary [[mathematics]], there are six traditional trigonometric functions; 

1. [[sine]] $\;$ $sin$

1. [[cosine]] $\;$ $cos$

1. [[tan|tangent]] $\;$ $\tan = \frac{\sin}{\cos}$, 

1. [[cotan|cotangent]] $\;$ $\cot = \frac{\cos}{\sin}$, 

1. [[secant]] $\;$ $\sec = \frac1{\cos}$, 

1. [[cosecant]] $\;$ $\csc = \frac1{\sin}$.

The early view was that these functions measured the six possible [[ratios]] of side [[lengths]] of right [[triangles]] (as a basic case in terms of which other triangles can be analyzed; "trigonometry" = "triangle measure"). 

These six functions figure prominently in [[Euclidean geometry]] where the angles of a triangle sum to [[arc length]] $\pi$. 

There are more elaborate offshoots such as [[spherical trigonometry]] (see [[elliptic geometry]]) which was historically important for terrestrial navigation. Moreover, there are the related [[hyperbolic functions]] (see [[hyperbolic geometry]]) which result from a projective change of [[conic section]] (from a circle to a [[hyperbola]]). 

## Definition 

The most useful modern approach to [[cos]] and [[sin]] comes from taking [[Euler's formula]] as a working definition:

Let 

$$
  \exp 
  \;\colon\; 
  \mathbb{C} 
    \longrightarrow 
   \mathbb{C}^\ast
$$ 

be the [[complex number|complex]] [[exponential function]], defined by the [[exponential]] [[power series]] formula 

$$
  \exp(z) 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{z^n}{n!}
  \,.
$$ 

These satisfy the following fundamental exponential identities: 

* $\exp(z+w) = \exp(z) \cdot \exp(w)$ ([[homomorphism]] from an additive [[group]] to a multiplicative group), 

* $\widebar{\exp(z)} = \exp(\widebar{z})$ (because [[complex conjugation]] $\widebar{(-)}$ is a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[field]] [[automorphism]]). 

As a result, if $z + \widebar{z} = 0$ (i.e., if $z$ is [[imaginary number|purely imaginary]]: $z = i t$ for some $t \in \mathbb{R}$), we have 

$$\exp(z) \cdot \widebar{\exp(z)} = 1$$ 

so that $w = \exp(z)$ lies on the unit circle defined by $w\widebar{w} = 1$. 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
The _cosine function_ $\cos: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by $\cos(t) = Re(\exp(i t))$ ([[real part]]); the _sine function_ $\sin: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by $\sin(t) = Im(\exp(i t))$ ([[imaginary part]]). In other words: $\exp(i t) = \cos(t) + i\sin(t)$ (Euler). 
=-- 

This implies that $\cos(t) = \frac1{2}(\exp(i t) + \exp(-i t))$ and $\sin(t) = \frac1{2 i}(\exp(i t) - \exp(-i t))$; these equations suggest the simple [[analytic continuation]] of $\cos$ and $\sin$ to functions $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ on the entire complex plane. 

## Properties 

More or less immediate consequences of the definition include 

* $(\cos t)^2 + (\sin t)^2 = 1$ ("[[Pythagorean theorem]]"), since $\exp(i t)$ lies on the unit circle. This is traditionally written as $\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1$; 

* $\cos(x + y) = \cos(x)\cos(y) - \sin(x)\sin(y)$ and $\sin(x + y) = \sin(x)\cos(y) + \cos(x)\sin(y)$ ("addition formulas"), by taking real and imaginary parts of the identity that says $\exp$ is a homomorphism; 

* $(\sin)' = \cos$ and $(\cos)' = -\sin$ (by [[differentiation|differentiating]] $\exp(i t)$); the connection with the arc length parametrization of the unit circle is that the derivative of the position vector $p'(t) = (\exp(i t))'$ is a velocity vector $i\exp(i t)$ of unit length; 

* $\cos(x + 2\pi) = \cos(x)$ and $\sin(x+2\pi) = \sin(x)$ ("[[periodicity]]"), according to the modern definition of [[pi]]; 

* $\cos(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0} (-1)^n \frac{x^{2 n}}{(2 n)!}$ and $\sin(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0} (-1)^n \frac{x^{2 n + 1}}{(2 n + 1)!}$, by exploiting the power series representation of the exponential function. 

These name but a few of many [[trigonometric identities]], facility in which can serve as a modern-day shibboleth or barrier of passage in high school or lower-level undergraduate courses in mathematics. They seem also to be popular in mathematics education in India and appear regularly in entrance examinations there. But the ones listed above are the most fundamental. 

There is no question that the trigonometric functions are rich in significance; for example; various representations of the tangent, cotangent, secant, etc. appear in [[enumerative combinatorics]] (as in the problem of counting alternating [[permutations]]), representations of [[Bernoulli numbers]], and so on.

## Idea

An inverse trigonometric function is a [[right inverse]] to one of the six standard [[trigonometric functions]], or more precisely a [[continuous function|continuous]] right inverse to the [[epimorphism]] part of the [[(epi, mono) factorization]] of a trigonometric function. 

Inverse functions are often named using the prefix "arc", so that for example "[[arcsine]]" is another name for the inverse [[sine]]. This naming arises because the values of an inverse trigonometric function are considered as [[arc lengths]], just as trigonometric functions themselves are defined in terms of arc length parametrizations. Another possible reason for using the *arc-* prefix is to avoid a notational confusion, where for example $\cos^{-1}$ might easily be confused with the [[reciprocal]] of the [[cosine]] function, inasmuch as the notation $\cos^n$ is commonly used to denote an $n^{th}$ power of the cosine. 

Since many such right inverses are possible, the choice of right inverse is a matter of convention. For the [[arcsine]] and [[arctangent]], the choice is dictated by having $0$ as a [[fixed point]]. This leads to convenient [[power series]] representations in [[neighborhoods]] of the origin, for example 

$$\arctan(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \ldots$$ 

For other inverse trigonometric functions, the choice is dictated by convenient formulas such as 

$$\arccos(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(x), \qquad \arccot(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan(x)$$ 

while we also have 

$$\arcsec(x) = \arccos(\frac1{x}), \qquad \arccsc(x) = \arcsin(\frac1{x}).$$

## Definition

In [[analysis]], _uniform convergence_ refers to a type of [[convergence]] of [[sequences]] $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of [[functions]] $f_n \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$  into the [[real numbers]]. In terms of [[epsilontic analysis]] such a sequence converges uniformly to some function $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ if for each [[positive real number]] $\epsilon \gt 0$ there exists a [[natural number]] $N_\epsilon \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(\epsilon)$ then for _all_ points $x \in X$ the difference (in [[absolute value]]) between the value of $f_n$ at that point and that of $f$ at that point is smaller than $\epsilon$:

$$
  \underset{\epsilon \gt 0}{\forall} 
   \;
  \underset{N(\epsilon) \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
   \;
  \underset{n \geq N(\epsilon)}{\forall}
   \;
  \underset{x \in X}{\forall}  
   \;
  \,
  \vert f_n(x) - f(x) \vert \lt \epsilon
  \,.
$$

What us _uniform_ about this convergence is that the bound $N(\epsilon)$ is required to work for all $x \in X$ (hence uniformly over $x$). This is in contrast to [[pointwise convergence]] where one allows a different bound $N$ to exist for each $\epsilon$ and each point $x \in X$ separately. Since for non-[[finite set|finite]] $X$ the [[maximum]] of all such local choices of $N$ in general does not exist, uniform convergence is a stronger condition than [[pointwise convergence]].

## Examples

+-- {: .num_prop #FunctionsUniformCauchySequence}
###### Proposition

Let 

1. $X$ be a [[set]];

1. $Y$ a [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]].

Consider the set $F(X,Y)$ of [[functions]] $X \to Y$ as a [[metric space]] via the [[supremum norm]]. Then this is again [[complete space|complete]]: every [[Cauchy sequence]] of functions converges uniformly.

If $X$ is equipped with the structure of a [[topological space]] and if the Cauchy sequence of functions consist of [[continuous functions]], then also the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] function is continuous.

# Radius of convergence
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

The radius of convergence of a [[power series]] tells how far out the series will [[convergence|converge]].


## Definition

Let $a = (a_0, a_1, \ldots)$ be an [[infinite sequence]] of [[complex numbers]], let $\zeta$ be a particular complex number, and consider the [[power series]]
\[ \sum_n a_n (z - \zeta)^n .\label{series}\]
The __radius of convergence__ is the [[supremum]] of the [[positive numbers]] $\epsilon$ such that (eq:series) converges for ${|z - \zeta|} \lt \epsilon$.  (This supremum is a nonnegative [[lower real]] in $[0,\infty]$.)

The phrasing above is ambiguous.  If $\epsilon$ is less than the radius of convergence, does this mean that (eq:series) converges for *every* $z$ with ${|z - \zeta|} \leq \epsilon$ or for *some* such $z$?  It doesn\'t matter:

+-- {: .num_theorem #radii}
###### Theorem
If (eq:series) converges for some $z$ with ${|z - \zeta|} = \epsilon$, then (eq:series) converges for every $z$ with ${|z - \zeta|} \lt \epsilon$.
=--
(We do *not* say that (eq:series) converges for $z$ with ${|z = \zeta|} = \epsilon$, but this has no effect on the supremum.)


## Properties

The radius of convergence is clearly independent of $\zeta$.  It can be calculated quite easily from the coefficients $a_i$:

+-- {: .num_theorem #Hadamard}
###### Theorem (Cauchy&#8211;Hadamard)
The radius of converge of (eq:series) is
$$ R = \liminf_n {|a_n|}^{-1/n} .$$
=--

For ${|z - \zeta|} \lt R$, (eq:series) is (pretty much by definition) an [[analytic function]] of $z$.  There is a partial converse:

+-- {: .num_theorem #analytic}
###### Theorem
If a function $f$ is analytic at all $z$ with ${|z - \zeta|} \lt R$, then there is a power series (eq:series) that converges to $f(z)$ for all $z$ with ${|z - \zeta|} \lt R$.
=--
(Specifically, $a_n = f^{(n)}(\zeta)/n!$.)


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Over the [[real numbers]], Theorem&#160;\ref{analytic} fails.  I\'m sure (says one of this pages authors) that there are interesting things to say about series in [[adic numbers]], [[matrices]], and things like that, but I don\'t know them.

## Definitions

A [[function]] $f$ between [[complex manifolds]] is __holomorphic__ if it is complex-[[differentiable function|differentiable]], or equivalently complex-[[analytic functions|analytic]].  One may also see definitions referring to the intermediate notions of [[continuously differentiable function|continuous differentiability]] or [[infinitely differentiable function|infinite differentiability]].

The theorem that every continuously complex-differentiable function is analytic is soft and due to [[Augustin Cauchy]]; the theorem that every complex-differentiable function is continuously differentiable is hard and due essentially to [[Édouard Goursat]] (which may be seen as filling in a gap in Cauchy's proof).  See [[Cauchy integral formula]] and [[Goursat theorem]].

On infinite-dimensional manifolds, we have several notions of holomorphic function; see [Wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite-dimensional_holomorphy).

## Definition

A [[topological space]] is called **locally path-connected** if it has a [[basis of the topology|basis]] of [[path-connected space|path-connected]] [[neighbourhoods]]. In other words, if for every point $x$ and [[neighbourhood]] $V \ni x$, there exists a path-connected neighbourhood $U \subset V$ that contains $x$.



## Properties

+-- {: .num_lemma #InLocallyPathConnectedSpaceThePathConnectedComponentsAreOpen}
###### Lemma

Let $X$ be a locally path connected space. Then the path connected component $P_x \subset X$ over any point $x \in X$ is an [[open set]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is sufficient to show that every point $y \in P_x$ has a [[neighbourhood]] $U_y$ which is still contained in $P_x$. But by local path connectedness, $y$ has a neighbourhood $V_y$ which is path connected. It follows by concatenation of paths that $V_y \subset P_x$.

=--


A locally path-connected space is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if it is [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]].  


+-- {: .num_prop #ForLocallyPathConnectedTheConnectedComponentsCoincideWithThePathConnectedComponents}
###### Proposition

The [[connected components]] of a locally path-connected space are the same as its path-connected components.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A path connected component is always connected ([this lemma](connected+space#ConnectedPathConnectedSpace)), and in a locally path-connected space is it also open (lemma \ref{InLocallyPathConnectedSpaceThePathConnectedComponentsAreOpen}).
This means that every path-connected component is also connected.


Conversely, it is now sufficient to see that every connected component is path-connected. Suppose it were not, then it would be covered by 
more than one disjoint non-empty path-connected components. 
But by lemma \ref{InLocallyPathConnectedSpaceThePathConnectedComponentsAreOpen} these
would be all open. This would be in contradiction with the assumption that 
$U$ is connected. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

=--

## Examples

###### Examples
**([[Euclidean space]] is locally path-connected)**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (with its [[metric topology]]) is locally path-connected, since each [[open ball]] is [[path-connected topological space]].

Similarly the [[open intevals]], [[closed intervals]] and [[half-open intervals]], regarded as [[topological subspaces]] of the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[real line]], are locally path connected.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
**(open subspace of locally path-connected space is locally path connected)**


Every [[open subset|open]] [[subspace]] of a locally path connected topological space is itself locally path connected.

###### Example
**([[circle]] is locally path-connected)**

The [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[circle]] 

$$
  S^1 = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \;\vert\;  {\Vert x\Vert} = 1\right\}
  \subset \mathbb{R}^2
$$

is locally path connected.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of the [[subspace topology]] and the defining [[topological base]] of the [[Euclidean plane]], a [[base for a topology|base for the topology]] of $S^1$ is given by the [[images]] of [[open intervals]] under the [[local homeomorphism]]

$$
  (cos(-), sin(-)) \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \to S^1
  \,.
$$

But these open intervals are locally path connected by example \ref{LocallyPathConnectedEuclideanSpace}, and in fact they are, evidently [[path-connected topological space]].

## Idea

An [[inhabited]] [[graph]] has two notions of being connected:

*  **weak connected** - it cannot be decomposed as the [[disjoint union]] of two inhabited graphs.

* **strong or path connected** - each [[pair]] of [[vertices]] is connected by a sequence of [[edges]] or in other words every [[homset]] of its [[free category]] is inhabited.

If a graph's edges are [[graph#undirected_graphs|undirected]] these two notions coincide while if [[graph#directed_graphs|directed]] the stronger condition implies the weaker.

For the various categories of graphs, which of their objects are _weakly connected_ correspond to the general notion of [[connected objects]] in these categories.

## Examples

* In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] the [[formal power series]] of [[Feynman amplitudes]] labeled by those [[Feynman diagrams]] whose underlying [[graphs]] are connected is called the _[[effective action]]_ $S_{eff}$. The [[exponential]] of the effective action then yields the full [[Feynman perturbation series]] over all Feynman diagrams. See at _[[S-matrix]]_ for more.

## Statement

The **chain rule** is the statement that [[differentiation]] $d : Diff \to Diff$  is a [[functor]] on [[Diff]]:

given two [[smooth function]]s between [[smooth manifold]]s $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ we have

$$
  d(g \circ f) : 
  T X 
  \stackrel{d f}{\to}
  T Y 
  \stackrel{d g}{\to}
  T Z
  \,.
$$

If one thinks of a [[tangent vector]] $v \in T_x X$ to be an equivalence class of a smooth path $\gamma_v : [-\epsilon,\epsilon] \to X$, for some $\epsilon\gt 0$, with $\gamma(0) = x$, then the chain rule is the [[associativity]] of the composite

$$
  [-\epsilon,\epsilon] \stackrel{\gamma_v}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z
  \,.
$$

Bracketed as $(g \circ f)\circ \gamma_v$ this represents $d(g \circ f)(v)$. Bracketed as $g \circ (f \circ \gamma_v)$ is represents $d g (d f (v))$.

Alternatively, in a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]] where with $D$ being the [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal interval]] we may _identify_ $v$ with $v : D \to X$, the chain rule is the associativity of

$$
  D \stackrel{v}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y \stackrel{g}{\to} Z
  \,.
$$


## Examples

### Elementary calculus

Let $X = Y = Z = \mathbb{R}$ the [[real line]]. Then the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ is canonically identified with $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$.

Given two functions, $f, g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ their derivatives are traditionally regarded again as functions $f', g' : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, though strictly speaking we are to think of them as the maps

$$
  d f, d g : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = T \mathbb{R}  \to T \mathbb{R}  = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}
$$

given by

$$
  d f : (x,v) \mapsto (f(x), v f'(x))
$$

and

$$
  d g : (x,v) \mapsto (g(x), v g'(x))
  \,.
$$

The composite

$$
  d (g \circ f) : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = 
  T \mathbb{R} \to T \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}
$$

is therefore the map

$$
  d(g \circ f) : (x,v) \mapsto (f(x), v f'(x)) 
   \mapsto 
     (g(f(x)), v f'(x) g'(f(x)))
  \,.
$$

Therefore we have

$$
  (g \circ f)'(x) = f'(x) g'(f(x))
  \,.
$$

This is the form in which the chain rule is usually introduced in elementary calculus. 


#### Remarks

While the chain rule is of great theoretical importance, it is completely unnecessary for the working out of derivatives of elementary functions in ordinary calculus (including the multivariable case).  Every result giving the derivative of an elementary function corresponds to a rule (along the lines of the [[product rule]]) for the operation of that function to any expression.  For example, instead of learning that
$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} (\sin x) = \cos x $$
and then applying both this fact *and* the chain rule to find the derivative of an expression of the form $\sin u$, just learn
$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} (\sin u) = \cos u \,\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x} $$
and apply this rule directly; the original fact is the special case in which $u \coloneqq x$.  Even better, learn the rule as
$$ \mathrm{d}(\sin u) = \cos u \,\mathrm{d}u ;$$
then it applies without further modification to multivariable calculus (as well as implicit differentiation, related rates, integration by substitution, and other stock features of one-variable calculus).

The chain rule could still be used in the *proof* of this 'sine rule'.  Even so, it is quite possible to prove the sine rule directly (much as one proves the product rule directly rather than using the two-variable chain rule and the partial derivatives of the function $x, y \mapsto x y$).  In any case, the chain rule is not directly needed when working out specific derivatives.  As a *rule* of differentiation, the chain rule is needed only when an unspecified [[differentiable function]] $f$ appears, and then may be given in the form
$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \bigl(f(u)\bigr) = f'(u) \,\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x} $$
or
$$ \mathrm{d}\bigl(f(u)\bigr) = f'(u) \,\mathrm{d}u $$
to match other rules.

Although the chain rule is often written as

\[ 
  \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}u} 
  \,
  \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x} ,\label{trivial} 
\]

this is an oversimplification.  Upon choosing an independent variable, it is possible (and easy) to give a rigorous definition of the [[derivative|differential]] $\mathrm{d}u$, and then (eq:trivial) is a triviality (assuming no division by zero).  However, with such a definition of differential, (eq:trivial) is *not* the chain rule!  The reason is that, when (eq:trivial) is used as a mnemonic for the chain rule, ${\mathrm{d}u}/{\mathrm{d}x}$ uses $x$ as the independent variable, but ${\mathrm{d}y}/{\mathrm{d}u}$ uses $u$.  Either may be chosen to define differentials[^invertibility], but one must (a priori) be consistent.  Now, it so happens that the choice of independent variable is entirely irrelevant; differentials have the same meaning no matter which independent variable is used.  But *this* fact requires proof; *it* is the chain rule (or at least a prerequisite for using (eq:trivial) as the chain rule), and it is *not* a triviality.  In this form, the chain rule is also known as **Cauchy's invariant rule**.

[^invertibility]:  Well, either may be chosen as long as their differentials are nowhere zero, which is exactly what must be true for (1) to make sense.  More precisely, given that $x$ works as an independent variable, the Chain Rule tells us that $u$ works just as well so long as $\mathrm{d}u$ (as defined using $x$) is nowhere zero.  This may be related to the easy but wrong proof of the Chain Rule that founders on a division by zero in exactly the same place (where $\mathrm{d}u$ would be), although I don't see a direct connection. 


### Formal algebra 

The chain rule can also be discussed as a piece of formal algebra of [[power series]] (over a general [[commutative ring]] $A$). We present a conceptual proof based on considerations of SDG. 

The statement is that if $q, p \in A[ [x] ]$ are power series, with $0$ the $0^{th}$ (constant) [[coefficient]] of $p$, then $(q \circ p)'(x) = q'(p(x))p'(x)$ under standard definitions. 

Let $D = A[y]/(y^2)$ be the [[representing object]] for [[derivations]]. Let $\delta: A[ [x] ] \to A[ [x] ] \otimes_A D \cong A[ [x] ][y]/(y^2)$  be the unique topological $A$-algebra map (under the $(x)$-[[adic topologies]]) that sends $x$ to $x + y$.  (If it helps, think $\delta(q) = q(x + y)$.)  For $p \in A[ [x] ]$, define $p'$ via the equation $\delta(p) = p(x) + p'(x)y$. 

Let $\pi: A[ [x] ] \otimes_A D \to A[ [x] ] \otimes_A D$ be the unique [[topological algebra]] map taking $x$ to $p(x)$ and $y$ to $p'(x)y$.  Let $- \circ p: A[ [x] ] \to A[ [x] ]$ denote the unique topological algebra map that takes $x$ to $p$. Then the diagram 

$$\array{
A[ [x] ] & \stackrel{\delta}{\to} &  A[ [x] ] \otimes_A D \\ 
\mathllap{- \circ p} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\pi} \\ 
A[ [x] ] & \underset{\delta}{\to} & A[ [x] ] \otimes_A D
}$$ 

commutes in the category of topological algebras, since the two legs agree when evaluated at the generator $x$. But then, evaluating each leg at a power series $q \in A [ [x]]$, we have 

$$[\delta(- \circ p)](q) = \delta(q \circ p) = (q \circ p)(x) + (q \circ p)'(x)y$$ 

and 

$$[\pi \delta](q) = \pi(\delta(q)) = \pi(q(x) + q'(x)y) = q(p(x)) + q'(p(x))(p'(x)y)$$ 

whence the coefficients of $y$ agree: $(q \circ p)'(x) = q'(p(x))p'(x)$.

# Extrema
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

In general, a __maximum__ is a [[top element]], a __minimum__ is a [[bottom element]], and an __extremum__ is either.  However, these terms are typically used in [[analysis]], where the [[order theory]] is secondary.  One also usually speaks of extrema of a [[function]], meaning a top or bottom element of the [[range]] of the function under its induced order as a [[subset]] of an ordered codomain.  In this context, one also considers *local* extrema of functions; a __local extremum__ of $f$ is an extremum of a [[restriction]] of $f$ to an [[open subspace]] of its original domain.  In any case, the extremum is __strict__ if the function takes the extreme value only once (in the relevant domain).


## Local extrema of differentiable functions

We list some sufficient and necessary conditions for a (nice) function $f$ on a [[smooth manifold]] to have a local extremum at a point $x$. As these are local conditions, we may assume $f$ is a function $U \to \mathbb{R}$ where $U$ is an [[open subset]] in a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$. These conditions fall under the rubric of "second derivative test". 

Assume $f$ to be a twice-[[differentiable function]], and let $x$ in its [[domain]] be a [[critical point]]: a point where its [[derivative]] / [[Jacobian]] vanishes. Let $H_x(f)$ be the [[Hessian matrix]] of the function. Recall that $x$ is a **nondegenerate** critical point if the symmetric [[matrix]] $H_x$ is nondegenerate; equivalently, if $0$ is not an [[eigenvalue]] of $H_x$. 

Let $x$ be a nondegenerate critical point. Then  

* For $x$ to be a **strict local minimum** within some neighborhood, it is necessary and sufficient that $H_x(f)$ be a [[positive definite form]]. 

* For $x$ to be a **strict local maximum** within some neighborhood, it is necessary and sufficient that $H_x(f)$ be a [[negative definite form]]. 

(The only other possibility left for a nondegenerate critical point is that $H_x(f)$ be an [[indefinite form]], having a mix of positive and negative eigenvalues. In this case, $x$ is a **saddle point**. For more on this, see [[Morse theory]].) 

If $x$ is a _degenerate_ critical point (so $0$ is an eigenvalue of $H_x$), we have: 

* For $x$ to be a **local minimum**, it is necessary that $H_x(f)$ be a [[positive semidefinite form]], i.e., that all eigenvalues are nonnegative.

* For $x$ to be a **local maximum**, it is necessary that $H_x(f)$ be a [[negative semidefinite form]], i.e., that all eigenvalues are nonpositive.

These conditions are not sufficient. For a simple example, the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a critical point of $f(x, y) = x^3 - y^3$, where the Hessian is the zero matrix (hence positive semidefinite and negative semidefinite), but clearly the origin is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum.

## Definition

The _diffeomorphism group_ $Diff(X)$ of a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is the [[group]] of its [[diffeomorphism]]s: the [[automorphism group]] of $X$ as an [[object]] of the [[category]] [[SmoothMfd]].

Beware that when $X$ is assumed [[orientable]] then sometimes, but not always, $Diff(X)$ is implicitly taken to be the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms. 



## Properties

### Relation to homotopy equivalences

For the following kinds of manifolds $\Sigma$ it is true that every [[homotopy equivalence]] 

$$
  \alpha \colon \Pi(\Sigma) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Pi(\Sigma)
$$

(hence every [[equivalence of infinity-groupoids|equivalence]] of their [[fundamental infinity-groupoids]]) is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to a [[diffeomorphism]]

$$
  a \colon \Sigma \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma
$$

i.e. that given $\alpha$ there is $a$ with

$$
  \alpha \simeq \Pi(a)
  \,.
$$

### Homotopy type and mapping class group
 {#HomotopyTypeAndMappingClassGroup}

The [[homotopy type]] $\Pi(Diff(\Sigma))$ of the diffeomorphism group $Diff(\Sigma)$ is of interest (e.g. [Hatcher 12](#Hatcher12)).

For instance this is the [[automorphism ∞-group]] of a manifold, regarded as a [[k-morphism]] in an [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]].

Specifically, the group of connected components is the [[mapping class group]]

$$
  \pi_0(\Pi(Diff(\Sigma))) = MCG(\Sigma)
  \,.

## Definition

### For scalar-valued functions

The **inverse function theorem** says that given any [[sequentially Cauchy complete]] [[Archimedean field]] $\mathbb{R}$ and a [[continuously differentiable function]] $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ from an [[open interval]] $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that for all points $a \in I$,
$$\left| \frac{d f}{d x}(a) \right| \gt 0$$
the [[inverse function]] $f^{-1}:\mathrm{im}(f) \to \mathbb{R}$ exists and is unique and is defined by the first-order nonlinear [[ordinary differential equation]]

$$\left(\frac{d f}{d x} \circ f^{-1}\right) \frac{d f^{-1}}{d x} = 1$$

with initial condition $f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$. Classically, $\mathbb{R}$ is essentially unique, but constructively, there are multiple inequivalent [[sequentially Cauchy complete]] [[Archimedean fields]]. 

### For vector-valued functions

To be done...

## Proof 

This proof is adapted from the Wikipedia article on the inverse function theorem, in the section "A proof using the contraction mapping principle", the contraction mapping principle being another name for the [[Banach fixed-point theorem]]. 

\begin{lemma}
Let $(-r, r)$ denote an [[open interval]] in $\mathbb{R}$ with radius $r$ and centre $0$. If $g:(-r, r) \to \mathbb{R}$ is a map such that $g(0) = 0$ and there exists a rational constant $0 \lt c \lt 1$ such that $\vert g(y) - g(x) \vert = c \vert y - x \vert$ for all $x \in (-r, r)$ and $y \in (-r, r)$, then $f = \mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R} + g$ is injective on $(-r, r)$ and 
$$(-(1 - c)r, (1 - c)r) \subset f((-r, r)) \subset (-(1 + c)r, (1 + c)r)$$
where $\mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R}$ is the identity map on the real numbers, restricted in the domain to $(-r, r)$, and given an open interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $f(I)$ is the [[image]] of $f$ under $I$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First, the map $f$ is injective on $(-r, r)$, since if $f(x) = f(y)$, then $g(y) - g(x) = x - y$ and so $\vert g(y) - g(x) \vert = \vert y - x \vert$,
which is a contradiction unless $y = x$. Next we show 
$$(-(1 - c)r, (1 - c)r) \subset f((-r, r))$$ 
The idea is to note that this is equivalent to, given a point $y$ in $(-(1-c) r, (1-c) r)$, find a fixed point of the map
$$F : [-r, r] \to [-r', r']$$
defined as $F(x) = y - g(x)$ where $0 \lt r' \lt r$ such that $\vert y \vert \leq (1-c)r'$ and the bar means a closed ball. To find a fixed point, we use the [[Banach fixed-point theorem]] and checking that $F$ is a well-defined strict-contraction mapping is straightforward. Finally, we have: 
$$f((-r, r)) \subset (-(1 + c)r, (1 + c)r)$$ 
since
$$\vert f(x) \vert = \vert x + g(x) - g(0) \vert \le (1+c) \vert x \vert$$
\end{proof}

Now that we have established the lemma, we could proved the main theorem:

\begin{proof}
It is enough to prove the special case when $a = 0, b = f(a) = 0$ and $f'(0) = \mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R}$. Let $g = f - \mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R}$. The [[mean value theorem]] applied to $t \mapsto g(x + t(y - x))$ says:
$$\vert g(y) - g(x) \vert \leq \vert y - x \vert \sup_{0 \lt t \lt 1} \vert g'(x + t(y - x)) \vert$$
Since $g'(0) = \mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R} - \mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R} = 0$ and $g'$ is continuous, we can find an $r \gt 0$ such that
$$\vert g(y) - g(x)\vert \leq 2^{-1} \vert y - x \vert$$
for all $x, y$ in $(-r, r)$. Then the earlier lemma says that $f = g + \mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R}$ is injective on $(-r, r)$ and $(-r/2, r/2) \subset (-r, r)$. Then
$$f : (-r, r) \cap f^{-1}((-r/2, r/2)) \to (-r/2, r/2)$$
is bijective and thus has the inverse, where given an open interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $f^{-1}(I)$ is the [[inverse image]] of $f$ over $I$.

## In constructive mathematics

The given proof of the inverse function theorem above relies on the [[mean value theorem]], which in [[constructive mathematics]] is only true for [[uniformly differentiable functions]]. There might be other proofs which might not rely on the [[mean value theorem]] and could prove the inverse function theorem for continuously differentiable functions. 

## As an axiom for Archimedean ordered fields

While [[continuously differentiable functions]] and [[locally uniformly differentiable functions]] are well-defined in every [[Archimedean ordered field]], the inverse function theorem does not hold in all Archimedean ordered fields. One could instead consider adding the inverse function theorem as an axiom to an arbitrary Archimedean ordered field $R$. There are a few axioms which could be used here 

* For any Archimedean ordered field $R$, the **continuously differentiable inverse function axiom** for $R$ states that given any differentiable function $f:I \to R$ on an open subinterval $I \subseteq R$ such that its derivative $\frac{d f}{d x}:I \to R$ is pointwise continuous and always apart from zero, there is a unique differentiable function $f^{-1}:\mathrm{im}(f) \to R$ called the **inverse function** with pointwise continuous derivative $\frac{d f^{-1}}{d x}:\mathrm{im}(f) \to R$ such that $f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$ and for all elements $a \in \mathrm{im}(f)$ and
$$\frac{d f}{d x}\left(f^{-1}(a)\right) \cdot \frac{d f^{-1}}{d x}\left(a\right) = 1$$

* For any Archimedean ordered field $R$, the **locally uniformly differentiable inverse function axiom** for $R$ states that given any differentiable function $f:I \to R$ on an open subinterval $I \subseteq R$ such that its derivative $\frac{d f}{d x}:I \to R$ is locally uniformly continuous and always apart from zero, there is a unique differentiable function $f^{-1}:\mathrm{im}(f) \to R$ called the **inverse function** with locally uniformly continuous derivative $\frac{d f^{-1}}{d x}:\mathrm{im}(f) \to R$ such that $f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$ and for all elements $a \in \mathrm{im}(f)$ and
$$\frac{d f}{d x}\left(f^{-1}(a)\right) \cdot \frac{d f^{-1}}{d x}\left(a\right) = 1$$

The former is stronger than the latter, although they are equivalent in the presence of [[excluded middle]]. If $R$ satisfies the locally uniformly continuous inverse function axiom, then $R$ is a [[real closed field]]. 

There is also a third possible axiom in [[dependent type theory]], which uses the [[shape modality]]. Given an Archimedean ordered field $R$, let $\esh \coloneqq L_R$ be the [[shape modality]], the [[localization of a type|localization]] at $R$. A type $T$ is shapewise contractible if its shape is contractible. Given an open interval $I \subseteq R$, a function $f:I \to R$ is shapewise continuous if the graph of $f$, the set of all pairs $(x, y)$ in $I \times R$ such that $y = f(x)$, is shapewise contractible:

$$\mathrm{isShapewiseContinuous}(f) \coloneqq \mathrm{isContr}\left(\esh\left(\sum_{x:I} \sum_{y:R} y =_{R} f(x)\right)\right)$$

* For any Archimedean ordered field $R$, the **shapewise continuously differentiable inverse function axiom** for $R$ states that given any differentiable function $f:I \to R$ on an open subinterval $I \subseteq R$ such that its derivative $\frac{d f}{d x}:I \to R$ is shapewise continuous and always apart from zero, there is a unique differentiable function $f^{-1}:\mathrm{im}(f) \to R$ called the **inverse function** with shapewise continuous derivative $\frac{d f^{-1}}{d x}:\mathrm{im}(f) \to R$ such that $f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$ and for all elements $a \in \mathrm{im}(f)$ and
$$\frac{d f}{d x}\left(f^{-1}(a)\right) \cdot \frac{d f^{-1}}{d x}\left(a\right) = 1$$

# Implicit function theorems

## Idea

Implicit function theorems give sufficient conditions for the existence of a [[differentiable map|differentiable]] [[inverse]] of a [[germ]] $f_p$ of a [[differentiable map]] $f\colon M \to N$ of [[smooth manifold]]s at a point $p$. The invertibility is trivially equivalent to the statement that the germ is a [[local diffeomorphism]] of some [[neighborhood]] of $p$ to some neighborhood of $f(p)$. If it is invertible, then we can consider the [[tangent map]] $T_p f\colon T_p M \to T_{f(p)}N$. If $f$ is locally invertible with differentiable inverse, then for all $y$ in some neighborhood of $y$ the [[functor]]iality of $T$ implies that $Id_{T_y} = T_y (f^{-1} \circ f) = T_{f(y)} f^{-1} \circ T_y f$ and alike for $f \circ f^{-1}$ at $f(y)$, demonstrating that $T_y f$ must then be invertible. The [[inverse function theorem]] says that the invertibility of $T_p f$ is in fact sufficient for the invertibility of the germ, which is then automatically differentiable. 


## In $\mathbf{R}^n$

Let $U \subset \mathbf{R}^n$ be an [[open set]] in a [[cartesian space]], $a\in U$, $f\colon U \to \mathbf{R}^n$ a [[continuously differentiable map|map]] of class $C^1$ and $det\left(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(a)\right)\neq 0$. Then there are open sets $V \ni a$, $W \ni f(a)$, $V \subset U$ such that $f|_V\colon V \to W$ is a [[diffeomorphism]] and for all $y \in W$ and $(f^{-1})'(y) = (f'[f^{-1}(y)])^{-1}$. 


## Local statement on manifolds

This is the theorem stated in the Idea section; the differentiable germ is assumed to be of class $C^1$ ([[continuously differentiable map|continuously differentiable]]). The statement is local, so one can consider it in [[chart]]s, hence the proof reduces to the case of $\mathbf{R}^n$.


## Global statement on manifolds

Let $f\colon M \to N$ be a [[smooth map]] of smooth manifolds. A point $q \in N$ is a __regular value__ of $f$ if for every point $p \in f^{-1}(q)$ the [[differential]] $T_p f\colon T_p M \to T_q N$ is an [[epimorphism]]. The implicit function theorem asserts that $Q = f^{-1}(p)$ is a smooth [[submanifold]] of $M$ and the [[tangent bundle]] $T M|_N$ globally splits as $T M|_N \cong T N \oplus \mathbf{R}^n$ where $n = dim N$.

More generally, if $W \subset N$ is a submanifold, we say that the map $f$ is __transversal along__ $W$ if for every point $x\in f^{-1}(W)$ there is an equality
$$
T_{f(x)} N = T_{f(x)}W + (T_x f)(T_x X)
.$$ 
In particular, $f$ is transveral along every regular value $p \in N$. The implicit function theorem asserts that the [[preimage]] $f^{-1}(W)$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$, the [[normal bundle]] $\nu(f^{-1}(W) \subset M)$ is isomorphic to $f^*(\nu(W\subset N))$, and the differential $T f$ exhibits the fiberwise isomorphism $\nu(f^{-1}(W)\subset M)\to \nu(W\subset N)$.

# $\sigma$-Algebras
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

$\sigma$-algebras and their variants are collections of [[subsets]] important in classical [[measure theory]] and [[probability theory]].

Although $\sigma$-algebras are often introduced as a mere technicality in the definition of [[measurable space]] (to specify the [[measurable subsets]]), even once one has a fixed measurable space $X$, it is often useful to consider additional (typically coarser) $\sigma$-algebras of measurable subsets of $X$.


## Definitions

We assume the law of [[excluded middle]] throughout; see [[Cheng measurable space]] for the constructive theory, and compare also [[measurable locale]].


### Short version

Given a [[set]] $X$, a __$\sigma$-algebra__ is a collection of [[subsets]] of $X$ that is closed under [[complement|complementation]] and under [[unions]] and [[intersections]] of [[countable set|countable]] [[family of subsets|families]].

Notice that the [[power set]] $\mathcal{P} X$ of $X$ is a [[Boolean algebra]] under the operations of complementation and of union and intersection of [[finite set|finite]] families.  Actually, it is a [[complete lattice|complete]] Boolean algebra, since we can also take unions and intersections of all families.  A $\sigma$-algebra is an intermediate notion, since (in addition to being closed under complementation) we require that it be closed under unions and intersections of *countable* families.


### Long version

Given a [[set]] $X$ and a collection $\mathcal{M}$ of [[subsets]] $S \subseteq X$, there are really several kinds of collections that $\mathcal{M}$ could be:

*  A __ring__ on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{M}$ which is closed under [[relative complement]]ation and under [[unions]] of [[finite set|finitary]] [[family of subsets|families]].  That is:

   1.  The [[empty set]] $\empty$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
   2.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[union]] $S \cup T$.
   3.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[relative complement]] $T \setminus S$.

   It follows that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under intersections of [[inhabited set|inhabited]] finite families and under [[symmetric difference]] of finite families:

   *  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their intersection $S \cap T = T \setminus (T \setminus S)$.
   *  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their symmetric difference $S \uplus T = (T \setminus S) \cup (S \setminus T)$.

   We can actually use the latter as an alternative to (2), since $S \cup T = (S \uplus T) \uplus (S \cap T)$.  Or we can use the pair as an alternative to (2,3), since $T \setminus S = (S \cap T) \uplus T$.  For that matter, we can weaken (1) to simply say that *some* set $S$ is in $\mathcal{M}$; then $\empty = S \setminus S$.

   While the union and symmetric difference of an [[empty family]] (both the empty set) belong to $\mathcal{M}$, the intersection of an empty family (which is $S$ itself) might not.  The term 'ring' dates from the days when a [[ring]] in algebra was not assumed to be unital; so a ring on $X$ is simply a subring (in this sense) of the [[Boolean ring]] $\mathcal{P} X$.


*  A __$\delta$-ring__ on $X$ is a ring (as above) $\mathcal{M}$ which is closed under [[intersections]] of countably infinite families.  That is:
   1.  The [[empty set]] $\empty$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
   2.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[union]] $S \cup T$.
   3.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[relative complement]] $T \setminus S$.
   4.  If $S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[intersection]] $\bigcap_i S_i$.

   Of course, every $\delta$-ring is a ring, but not conversely.  Actually, if you want to define the concept of $\delta$-ring directly, it\'s quicker if you use the symmetric difference; then (2,3) follow by the reasoning above and the [[idempotent|idempotence]] of intersection (so that $S \cap T = S \cap T \cap T \cap T \cap \cdots$).

   The symbol '$\delta$' here is from German 'Durchschnitt', meaning intersection; it may be used in many contexts to refer to intersections of countable families.


*  A __$\sigma$-ring__ on $X$ is a ring (as above) $\mathcal{M}$ which is closed under unions of [[countably infinite set|countably infinite]] families.  That is:
   1.  The [[empty set]] $\empty$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
   2.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[union]] $S \cup T$.
   3.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[relative complement]] $T \setminus S$.
   4.  If $S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[union]] $\bigcup_i S_i$.

   Now (2) is simply redundant; $S \cup T = S \cup T \cup T \cup T \cup \cdots$.  A $\sigma$-ring is obviously a ring, but in fact it is also a $\delta$-ring; $\bigcap_i S_i = (\bigcup_i S_i) \setminus \bigcup_j (\bigcup_i S_i \setminus S_j)$.

   The symbol '$\sigma$' here is from German 'Summe', meaning union; it may be used in many contexts to refer to unions of countable families.


*  An __algebra__ or __field__ on $X$ is a ring (as above) $\mathcal{M}$ to which $X$ itself belongs.  That is:
   1.  The [[empty set]] $\empty$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
   2.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[union]] $S \cup T$.
   3.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[relative complement]] $T \setminus S$.
   4.  The [[improper subset]] $X$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.

   Actually, (2) is now redundant again; $S \cup T = X \setminus ((X \setminus T) \setminus S)$.  But perhaps more importantly, $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under *absolute* [[complement|complementation]] (that is, complementation relative to the entire ambient set $X$); that is:

   *  If $S$ is in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is its [[complement]] $\neg{S}$.

   In light of this, the most common definition of algebra is probably to use this fact together with (1,2); then (3) follows because $T \setminus S = \neg(S \cup \neg{T})$ and (4) follows because $X = \neg\empty$.  On the other hand, one could equally well use intersection instead of union; absolute complements allow the full use of [[de Morgan duality]].

   The term 'field' here is even more archaic than the term 'ring' above; indeed the only field in this sense which is a [[field]] (in the usual sense) under symmetric difference and intersection is the field $\{\empty, X\}$ (for an [[inhabited set]] $X$).


*  Finally, a __$\sigma$-algebra__ or __$\sigma$-field__ on $X$ is a ring $\mathcal{M}$ that is both an algebra (as above) and a $\sigma$-ring (as above).  That is:
   1.  The [[empty set]] $\empty$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
   2.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[union]] $S \cup T$.
   3.  If $S$ and $T$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[relative complement]] $T \setminus S$.
   4.  The [[improper subset]] $X$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
   5.  If $S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[union]] $\bigcup_i S_i$.

   As with $\sigma$-rings, (2) is redundant; as with algebras, it\'s probably most common to use the absolute complement in place of (3,4).  Thus the usual definition of a $\sigma$-algebra states:
   1.  The [[empty set]] $\empty$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
   2.  If $S$ is in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is its [[complement]] $\neg{S}$.
   3.  If $S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots$ are in $\mathcal{M}$, then so is their [[union]] $\bigcup_i S_i$.


   And again we could again just as easily use [[intersection]] as union, even in the infinitary axiom.  That is, a $\delta$-algebra is automatically a $\sigma$-algebra, because $\bigcup_i S_i = \neg\bigcap_i \neg{S_i}$.


Any and all of the above notions have been used by various authors in the definition of measurable space; for example, Kolmogorov used algebras (at least at first), and Halmos used $\sigma$-rings.  Of course, the finitary notions (ring and algebra) aren\'t strong enough to describe the interesting features of [[Lebesgue measure]]; they are usually used to study very different examples ([[finitely additive measure]]s).  On the other hand, $\delta$&#8209; or $\sigma$-rings may be more convenient than $\sigma$-algebras for some purposes; for example, [[topological vector space|vector]]-valued measures on $\delta$-rings make good sense even when the absolute measure of the whole space is infinite.

Note that the collection of measurable sets with finite measure (in a given [[measure space]]) is a $\delta$-ring, while the collection of measurable sets with $\sigma$-finite measure is a $\sigma$-ring.


### Measurable sets

A __[[measurable space]]__ is usually defined to be a [[set]] $X$ with a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ on $X$; sometimes one of the more general variations above is used.

In any case, an __$\mathcal{M}$-[[measurable subset]] of $X$__, or just a __measurable set__, is any [[subset]] of $X$ that belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.  If $\mathcal{M}$ is one of the more general variations, then we also want some subsidiary notions: $S$ is __[[relatively measurable subset|relatively measurable]]__ if $S \cap T$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$ whenever $T$ does, and $S$ is __$\sigma$-[[sigma-measurable subset|measurable]]__ if it is a countable union of elements of $\mathcal{M}$.  Notice that every relatively measurable set is measurable iff $S$ is at least an algebra; in any case, the relatively measurable sets form a ($\sigma$)-algebra if $\mathcal{M}$ is at least a ($\delta$)-ring.  Similary, every $\sigma$-measurable set is measurable iff $S$ is at least a $\sigma$-ring; in any case, the $\sigma$-measurable sets form a $\sigma$-ring if $\mathcal{M}$ is at least a $\delta$-ring.


### Generating $\sigma$-algebras

As a $\sigma$-algebra is a collection of subsets, we might hope to develop a theory of [[base|bases]] and [[subbase|subbases]] of $\sigma$-algebras, such as is done for [[topological space|topologies]] and [[uniform space|uniformities]].  However, things do not work out as nicely.  (It *is* quite easy to generate rings or algebras, but generating $\delta$-rings and $\sigma$-rings is just as tricky as generating $\sigma$-algebras.)

We do get something by [[general abstract nonsense]], of course.  It\'s easy to see that the [[intersection]] of any collection of $\sigma$-algebras is itself a $\sigma$-algebra; that is, we have a [[Moore closure]].  So given any collection $\mathcal{B}$ of sets whatsoever, the intersection of all $\sigma$-algebras containing $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, the $\sigma$-algebra __generated__ by $\mathcal{B}$.  (We can similarly define the $\delta$-ring generated by $\mathcal{B}$ and similar concepts for all of the other notions defined above.)

What is missing is a simple description of the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{B}$.  (For a mere algebra, this is easy; any $\mathcal{B}$ can be taken as a _[[subbase]]_ of an algebra, the symmetric unions of finite families of elements of $\mathcal{B}$ form a _[[base]]_ of the algebra, and the intersections of finite families of elements of the base form an algebra.  For a ring, the only difference is to use intersections only of inhabited families.  But for anything from a $\delta$-ring to a $\sigma$-algebra, nothing this simple will work.)


In fact, the question of how to generate a $\sigma$-algebra is the beginning of an entire field of mathematics, [[descriptive set theory]].  For our purposes, we need this much:

*  Start with a collection $\Sigma_0$ (our collection $\mathcal{B}$ above), and let $\Pi_0$ be the collection of the complements of the members of $\Sigma_0$.
*  Let $\Sigma_1$ be the collection of unions of countably infinite families of sets in $\Pi_0$, and let $\Pi_1$ be the collection of their complements (the intersections of countably infinite families of sets in $\Sigma_0$); even $\Sigma_1 \cup \Pi_1$ is not in general a $\sigma$-algebra.
*  Continue by [[recursion|recursively]], defining $\Sigma_n$ for all [[natural numbers]] $n$.
*  Let $\Sigma_\omega$ be the union of the various $\Sigma_n$; although this is closed under complement, it is still not in general a $\sigma$-algebra.
*  Continue by [[transfinite induction|transfinite]] recursion, defining $\Sigma_\alpha$ for all countable [[ordinal numbers]] $\alpha$.
*  Let $\Sigma_{\omega_1}$ be the union of the various $\Sigma_\alpha$; *this* is finally a $\sigma$-algebra.

So we need an $\aleph_1$ steps, not just $2$.


(This is only the beginning of descriptive set theory; our $\Sigma_\alpha$ are their $\Sigma^0_\alpha$ ---except that for some reason they start with $\Sigma^0_1$ instead of $\Sigma^0_0$---, and the subject continues to higher values of the superscript.)

Note that [[countable choice]] is essential here and elsewhere in measure theory, to show that a countable union of a countable union is a countable union.  But the full [[axiom of choice]] is not; in fact, much of descriptive set theory (although this is irrelevant to the small portion above) works better with the [[axiom of determinacy]] instead.


## Examples

*  Of course, the [[power set]] of $X$ is closed under all operations, so it is a $\sigma$-algebra.


*  If $X$ is a [[topological space]], the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets (or equivalently, by the closed sets) in $X$ is the __Borel $\sigma$-algebra__; its elements are called the __[[Borel sets]]__ of $X$. In particular, the Borel sets of [[real numbers]] are the Borel sets in the [[real line]] with its usual topology.

*  In the application of [[statistical physics]] to [[thermodynamics]], we have both a microcanonical [[phase space]] $P$ (typically something like $\mathbb{R}^N$ for $N$ on the order of [[Avogadro's number]]) describing every last detail of a [[physical system]] and a macrocanonical phase space $p$ (typically $\mathbb{R}^2$ or at least $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \lt 10$) describing those features of the system that can be measured practically, with a projection $P \to p$.  Then the [[preimage]] under this projection of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $p$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $P$, and the thermodynamic [[entropy]] of the system is (theoretically) its information-theoretic entropy with respect to this $\sigma$-algebra.


*  If a measurable space $(X,\mathcal{M})$ is equipped with a (positive) measure $\mu$, making it into a [[measure space]], then the sets of measure zero form a $\sigma$-[[sigma-ideal|ideal]] of $\mathcal{M}$ (that is an [[ideal]] that is also a sub-$\sigma$-ring).  Let a __[[null set]]__ be *any* set (measurable or not) contained in a set of measure zero; then the null sets form a $\sigma$-ideal in the [[power set]] of $X$.  Call a set __$\mu$-measurable__ if it is the union of a measurable set and a null set; then the $\mu$-measurable sets form a $\sigma$-algebra called the __completion__ of $\mathcal{M}$ under $\mu$.  (Even if $\mathcal{M}$ is only a $\delta$-ring, still the null sets will form a $\sigma$-ring; in any case, we get as completion the same kind of structure as we began with.)  Note that we can also do this by starting with any $\sigma$-ideal $\mathcal{N}$ and simply declaring by fiat that these are the null sets, as with a [[localisable measurable space]]; then we speak of the __completion__ of $\mathcal{M}$ with respect to $\mathcal{N}$ (or sometimes with respect to the $\delta$-[[delta-filter|filter]] $\mathcal{F}$ of [[full sets]]).

*  In particular, the __Lebesgue-measurable__ sets in the real line are the elements of the completion of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra under [[Lebesgue measure]].


## Alternatives

We are now learning ways to understand measure theory and probability away from the traditional reliance on sets required with $\sigma$-algebras; see [[measurable space]] for a summary of other ways to define this concept.  We still need to know what happens to all of the *other* $\sigma$-algebras of measurable sets in a measurable space.  One solution may to use [[quotient space|quotient]] measurable spaces in place of sub-$\sigma$-algebras; for example, see explicit quotient in the example of macroscopic entropy above.

## Idea

Measure theory studies [[measurable spaces]] and [[measure spaces]].


## History

Measure theory is the field of mathematics that grew out of the [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue integral]] and Kolmogorov\'s axioms for [[probability]].  


## Some subfields and applications

The general measure theory studies general notions and constructions in measure theory, like the connection to integration, the measure spaces, derivation by measure, [[Caratheodory construction]] and so on.

[[probability theory|Probability theory]] studies special class of measures, so called [[probability measure]]s which are normalized to unity.

Measure theory is very much having a central role in studying so called [[ergodic theory]] of dynamical system.

[[geometric measure theory|Geometric measure theory]] is the geometric study of measures of subsets of Euclidean space and the measure theoretic aspects of various geometric objects, like the integration of classes of currents and their extremization properties.    

There is a generalization, the noncommutative measure theory, which is more or less the study of [[von Neumann algebra]], see [Connes (1995)](#Connes1995).

## Idea

The _counting measure_ on a [[measurable set]] (in particular on a [[countable set]]) is the [[measure]] which assigns to a [[subset]] the [[cardinality]] of this subset (hence which "counts" the number of elements of the subset).

## Idea

For $p \in \mathbb{R}$, $p \geq 1$, the _$p$-norm_ is a [[norm]] on suitable [[real vector spaces]] given by the $p$th [[root]] of the [[sum]] (or [[integral]]) of the $p$th-[[powers]] of the [[absolute values]] of the vector components. With due care the definition makes sense for non-[[finite dimensional vector spaces]] such as [[sequence spaces]] and [[Lebesgue spaces]], making them into [[normed vector spaces]], hence [[metric spaces]].

For $p = 1$ the $p$-norm is the _Taxicab norm_ or _Manhattan norm_.

For $p = 2$ the $p$-norm is the standard _Euclidean norm_, defining [[Euclidean spaces]] and [[Hilbert spaces]] of [[square integrable functions]].

For $p = \infty$ the $p$-norm (found by taking the limit $p \to \infty$) is the [[supremum]] (or [[essential supremum]] in the continuous case) of the absolute values of the components of vectors, then called the _supremum norm_.

For $0 \leq p \lt 1$ one may still make sense of the formulas that define $p$-norms for $p \geq 1$ (see at _[Generalizations](#Generalizations)_ below), but the resulting concepts are no longer genuine norms.


## Definition

The concept of $p$-norm makes sense in increasing generality, 

* _[For finite-dimensional vector spaces](#ThePNorm)_;

* _[For spaces of sequences of real numbers](#OnSequenceSpaces)_;

* _[For spaces of measurable functions](#OnLebesgueSpaces)_.


### The $p$-norm on finite dimensional vector spaces
 {#ThePNorm}

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $p \in \mathbb{R}$, $p \gt 0$, the _$p$-norm_ $\Vert - \Vert_p$ is the [[norm]] on the [[real vector space|real]] [[finite dimensional vector space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ given by the $p$th [[root]] of the [[sum]] of the $p$-[[powers]] of the [[absolute value]] of the components of a given [[vector]] $\vec x = (x)_{i = 1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^n$: 

$$ 
  {\Vert \vec x \Vert_p}  \coloneqq \root p {\sum_i {\vert x_i\vert^p}} 
$$

Equipping it with this [[norm]] makes $\mathbb{R}^n$ a  _[[normed vector space]]_.

For $p = 2$ this is the _Euclidean norm_, the standard norm that defines [[Euclidean space]].

For $p = \infty$ one takes the [[supremum]] over the [[absolute values]] of the components

$$
  {\Vert \vec x\Vert_\infty}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{1 \leq i \leq n}{sup} {\vert x_i\vert}
  \,.
$$

</div>

The graphics on the right (grabbed from Wikipedia) shows unit circles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to various [[p-norms]].


### The $\mathcal{l}^p$-norm on sequence spaces
 {#OnSequenceSpaces}

For $p \in \mathbb{R}$, write $\ell^p$ for the vector space of those [[sequences]] $(x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ for which the [[series]]

$$
  \underset{i \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum} {\vert x_i\vert}^p
    \;\lt\; 
  \infty
$$

(the [[sum]] of the $p$th [[powers]] of the [[absolute value]] of the components of the sequence) [[convergence|converges]].

For $p \geq 1$ the the [[function]]

$$
  {\Vert -\Vert_p}
  \;\colon\;
  \ell^p
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}
$$

$$
  {\Vert (x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \Vert_p}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \root{p}{\underset{i \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum} {\vert x_i\vert^p}}
$$

defines a [[norm]] on this [[real vector space]]. This [[normed vector space]] is [[complete metric space|complete]], hence a [[Banach space]]. This is called the _[[sequence space]]_.

For $p = \infty$ one takes $\ell^\infty$ to be the space of bounded sequences and

$$
  {\Vert (x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \Vert_\infty}
   \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{sup} {\vert x_k\vert }
$$

to be the [[supremum]] over the [[absolute values]] of the components of the sequence. This is also called the _supremum norm_.


### The $L^p$-norm on Lebesgue spaces
 {#OnLebesgueSpaces}

More generally, for $(X,\mu)$ a [[measure space]], write $L^p(X)$ for the [[vector space]] of [[equivalence classes]] of those [[measurable functions]] $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$, for which the [[integral]]

$$
  \int_X {\vert f \vert^p}  d\mu \;\lt\; \infty
$$

exists, and where two such functions are regarded as equivalent, $f_1 \sim f_2$, if

$$
  \int_X {\vert f_2 - f_1 \vert^p}  d\mu \;=\; 0
  \,. 
$$

On this space the function

$$
  {\Vert -\Vert_p}
  \;\colon\;
  L^p(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

$$
  {\Vert f \Vert_p}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \root{p}{\int_X {\vert f\vert^p}} d\mu 
$$

defines a [[norm]]. The [[triangle inequality]] holds due to [[Minkowski's inequality]].  The [[normed vector space]] $(L^p(X), {\Vert- \Vert_p})$ is also called a _[[Lebesgue space]]_.


## Generalizations for $0 \leq p \lt 1$
 {#Generalizations}

For $0 \leq p \lt 1$, the above definitions for $\Vert {-}\Vert_p$ still make sense in themselves, but the result is no longer a norm, as [[Minkowski's inequality]] (the [[triangle inequality]] for $p$-norms) fails.

A variant definition for $0 \lt p \leq 1$ (which agrees with the usual definition for $p = 1$, preserving continuity in $p$) leaves out the $p$th root; then the result satisfies the triangle inequality (and indeed is a [[metric]]) but fails to be a norm because it is not positive-homogeneous of degree $1$ (but of degree $p$ instead).  Such a thing is called an [[F-norm]].

For $p = 0$, we might try to take the limit as $p \searrow 0$.  For the unmodified $p$-norm (with the root), this is infinite if there is more than one nonzero entry and is the absolute value of the one nonzero entry if there is only one (or 0 if there is none); for the modified $p$-norm (without the root), it is the (possibly infinite) number of nonzero entries.  In either case, however the triangle inequality fails.  Therefore, there is a further modified $0$-norm, given by
$$ {\|(x_1, x_2, \ldots)\|_0} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {2^{-n} {|x_n|}} {1 + {|x_n|}} $$
for $l^0$, and this is an $F$-norm.  (But I don\'t know what is the justification for thinking of this as a $p$-norm for $p = 0$.)

(This entry describes two distinct notions, one in the theory of [[inner product spaces]], and the second in a more purely [[category theory|category theoretic]] context.)

## In inner product spaces

Two elements $x,y$ in an [[inner product space]], $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$, are **orthogonal** or [[normal vectors]], denoted $x \perp y,$ if $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$.

## In category theory

### Definition 

Two [[morphism]]s $e:A\to B$ and $m:C\to D$ in a [[category]] are said to be **orthogonal**, written $e\perp m$, if $e$ has the [[left lifting property]] with respect to $m$, i.e. if in any [[commutative diagram|commutative square]]

$$
\array{ A & \overset{e}{\to} & B\\
  \downarrow && \downarrow \\
  C & \underset{m}{\to} & D}
$$

there exists a unique diagonal [[filler]] making both triangles commute:

$$
\array{ A & \overset{e}{\to} & B\\
  \downarrow & \swarrow & \downarrow \\
  C & \underset{m}{\to} & D}
$$

Given a [[class]] of maps $E$, the class $\{m | e\perp m \;\forall e\in E\}$ is denoted $E^{\downarrow}$ or $E^\perp$.  Likewise, given $M$, the class $\{e | e\perp m \;\forall m\in M\}$ is denoted $M^{\uparrow}$ or ${}^\perp M$.  These operations form a [[Galois connection]] on the poset of classes of morphisms in the ambient category.  In particular, we have $({}^\perp(E^\perp))^\perp = E^\perp$ and ${}^\perp(({}^\perp M)^\perp) = {}^\perp M$.

A pair $(E,M)$ such that $E^\perp = M$ and $E = {}^\perp M$ is sometimes called a **prefactorization system**.  If in addition every morphism factors as an $E$-morphism followed by an $M$-morphism, it is an (orthogonal) [[orthogonal factorization system|factorization system]].

### Examples 

* Of course, any [[orthogonal factorization system]] gives plenty of examples.  The ur-example is that $e\perp m$ in [[Set]] (or actually, any [[pretopos]]) for any surjection $e$ and injection $m$.

* A [[strong epimorphism]] in any category is, by definition, an epimorphism in ${}^\perp(Mono)$, where $Mono$ is the class of monomorphisms.  (If the category has equalizers, then every map in ${}^\perp(Mono)$ is epic.)  Dually, a [[strong monomorphism]] is a monomorphism in $(Epi)^\perp$.

* The [[orthogonal subcategory problem]] for a [[class]] of [[morphism]]s $\Sigma$ in a [[category]] $C$ asks whether the [[full subcategory]] $\Sigma^\perp$ of [[object]]s $X$ [[orthogonal]] to $\Sigma$ is a [[reflective subcategory]]. Here we define $f \perp X$ to mean $f \perp !: X \to 1$. 

  The orthogonal subcategory problem is related to [[localization]]. Suppose $\Sigma^\perp$ is indeed a [[reflective subcategory]]; let $r: C \to \Sigma^\perp$ be the reflector (the [[left adjoint]] to the inclusion $i: \Sigma^\perp \to C$). Certainly $r$ sends arrows in $\Sigma$ to isomorphisms in $\Sigma^\perp$. Indeed, if $f: A \to B$ belongs to $\Sigma$, then the inverse to $r(f): r(A) \to r(B)$ is the unique arrow extending $1_{r(A)}$ along $r(f): r(A) \to r(B)$ to an arrow $g: r(B) \to r(A)$, using the fact that $r(A)$ belongs to $\Sigma^\perp$.

## Idea

**Algebra** is the manipulation of symbols without (necessarily) regard for their meaning, especially in a way that can be formalized in [[cartesian logic]].  It is often seen as [[duality|dual]] to [[geometry]]. While modern algebra has ties and applications nearly everywhere in mathematics, traditionally closest ties are with the [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]].

The word 'algebra' is often also used for an algebraic structure:

* often by default an [[associative unital algebra]];
* more generally a [[monoid object]];
* more generally in a different way, a [[nonassociative algebra]];
* an [[algebra over an operad]], of a [[monad]], a [[PROP]], etc;
* an [[algebra for an endofunctor]];
* a model of any [[algebraic theory]] or anything studied in [[universal algebra]];
* higher categorical analogues, many object/family versions of algebras, for example [[algebroid]]s, and [[pseudoalgebra]]s (or [[2-algebra]]s) over [[pseudomonad]]s (or [[2-monad]]s).

Various fields of mathematics or mathematical concepts can be manipulated in an algebraic or symbolic way, and such approaches or formalized subfields have names like [[categorical algebra]], [[homological algebra]], [[homotopical algebra]] and so on. Methods of combinatorics which involve much algebra, and manipulations with [[formal power series]] in particular, are called [[algebraic combinatorics]].

## Related entries

The $n$lab has a number of entries on particular algebraic structures ([[monoid]], [[semigroup]], [[group]], [[ring]], [[noetherian ring]], [[quasigroup]], [[associative algebra]], [[Lie algebra]], [[coalgebra]], [[dg-algebra]], [[bialgebra]], [[graded algebra]], [[Hopf algebra]], [[coring]], [[quasitriangular bialgebra]], [[lattice]], [[rig]], [[near-ring]], $\Omega$-[[$\Omega$-group|group]], [[field]], [[perfect field]], [[skewfield]], [[free field]], [[vector space]], [[vertex operator algebra]], [[crossed module]], [[chain complex]], [[hypermonoid]], [[hyperring]], [[hyperfield]], [[truss]], [[brace]] etc.), entries on their structural features, parts, "envelopes" or localizations ([[ideal]], [[center]], [[centralizer]], [[normal subgroup]], [[normal closure]], [[normalizer]], [[holomorph]], [[Ore set]], [[Ore localization]], [[enveloping algebra]], [[universal enveloping algebra]]) and on algebraic structures internal to other categories ([[topological group]], [[Lie group]], [[Lie groupoid]], [[algebraic group]], [[formal group]], [[dg-algebra]] etc). 

There are also few pages on various invariants of algebraic objects or operations on algebraic expressions, e.g. on [[resultants]] of polynomials, [[determinant]] of a matrix, [[quasideterminant]] of a matrix with noncommutative entries.   

For many algebraic structures a notion of [[action]] is defined; they embody "symmetry algebras" of some other algebraic objects. An action is expressed via a [[representation]] of one object as a subobject of a full object of another; or as a combination of the object which acts and which is acted upon (e.g. [[action groupoid]]). Objects with action are [[modules]] of the appropriate kind (possibly dualized: [[comodule]], [[contramodule]]; multiple, e.g. [[bimodule]]; or homotopized like $A_\infty$-modules). The possibilities for realizing a given algebra via symmetries of another object are systematically studied in a field called [[representation theory]].

# Bilinear forms
* table of contents

## Definitions

A __bilinear form__ is simply a [[linear map]] $\langle -,-\rangle\colon V \otimes V \to k$ out of a [[tensor product]] of $k$-[[module]]s into the [[ring]] $k$ (typically taken to be a [[field]]).

It is called __symmetric__ if $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$ for all $x,y \in V$. For variants on this, such as the property of being _conjugate-symmetric_, see [[inner product space]]. 

It is called _nondegenerate_ if the [[mate]] $V \to V^\ast = \hom(V, k)$ is injective (a [[monomorphism]]). 

Let $k = \mathbb{R}$ be the [[real number]]s. A symmetric bilinear form is called

* [[positive definite]] if $\langle x,x\rangle \gt 0$ if $x \neq 0$.

* [[negative definite]] if $\langle x,x\rangle \lt 0$ if $x \neq 0$.


## Examples

* An _[[inner product]]_ on a real vector space is an example of a symmetric bilinear form. (For some authors, an inner product on a real vector space is precisely a positive definite symmetric bilinear form. Other authors relax the positive definiteness to nondegeneracy. Perhaps some authors even drop the nondegeneracy condition (citation?).) 

* If $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is of class $C^2$, then the [[Hessian]] of $f$ at a point defines a symmetric bilinear form. It may be degenerate, but in [[Morse theory]], a [[Morse function]] is a $C^2$ function such that the Hessian at each critical point is nondegenerate.

## Idea ##
This page is about the polar decomposition of [[bounded operators]] on [[Hilbert spaces]]. Any complex number $z$ has a representation as $z = r e^{i \phi}$ with $r \in \mathbb{R}, r \ge 0$ being the absolute value of $z$ and the complex number $e^{i \phi}$ of norm $1$ being the modulus, or the complex sign, of $z$. The polar decomposition of a bounded operator is a generalization of this representation. 


## Definition ##
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a [[Hilbert space]] and $S_1, S_2$ be closed linear subspaces.

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition
An unitary isomorphism
$$
   U: S_1 \to S_2
$$
is called a **partial isometry** with **initial space** $S_1$ and **final space** or range $S_2$

Let $T$ be a bounded operator on $\mathcal{H}$

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definitions
The positive operator 
$$
   |T| := (T^*T)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$
is called the **modulus** of T.

## The Theorem ##
For every bounded operator $T$ on $\mathcal{H}$ there exists a unique partial isometry $U$ such that

1. U has initial space $\overline{R(|T|)}$ and range $\overline{R(T)}$

2. $T = U |T| = U (T^*T)^{\frac{1}{2}}$

## Properties ##
We have stated the theorem for the [[operator algebra]] $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ only, for a general [[C-star algebra]] $C$ it need not hold because the partial isometry $U$ need not be contained in $C$. 

This is true however for every [[von Neumann algebra]].

## Definition ##

In [[Euclidean geometry]], a **regular polygon** is a (simple, non self-intersecting) [[polygon]] in a [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every [[segment]] of the [[boundary]] of the polygon has the same [[length]] and every [[angle]] between two segments of the boundary of the polygon has the same angle [[measure]]. (The boundary of a regular polygon is sometimes called called a **regular polygonal line**)

## Perimeter and area ##

We are using the [[circle constant]] $\tau = 2 \pi$. 

Every regular polygon is the union of $n$ congruent [[triangles]] each with segments of length $r$ and $r$ respectively and an angle of $\frac{\tau}{n}$ between the two segments of length $r$. As a result, the triangles are isosceles and the altitude from the center of the regular polygon to the third segment of the triangles bisects the angle: such that the angles between the [[circumradius]] and the altitude is $\frac{\tau}{2n}$. The length of the third segment is thus given by 

$$b \coloneqq r \sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2n}\right) + r \sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2n}\right) = 2 r \sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2n}\right)$$

The perimeter of a regular polygon $\mathcal{P}_n$ (strictly speaking, a regular polygonal line) with $n$ sides and [[circumradius]] $r$ is given by the sequence of functions $P_\mathcal{P}:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R})$

$$P_\mathcal{P}(n)(r) = n b = r (2 n) \sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2n}\right)$$

The area of a regular polygon $\mathcal{P}_n$ with $n$ sides and [[circumradius]] $r$ is given by the sequence of functions $P:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R})$

$$A_\mathcal{P}(n)(r) = n \left(\frac{1}{2} r b\right) = n \frac{1}{2} r (2 r) \sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2n}\right) = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (2 n) \sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2n}\right)$$

### For series in the real numbers

In [[real analysis]], given a sequence $a:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ in the [[real numbers]], the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n$ is **absolutely convergent** if the [[sequence]] of [[partial sums]] is a [[Cauchy sequence]], and the [[sequence]] of [[partial sums]] of the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \vert a_n \vert$ is also a Cauchy sequence. 

### For series in Banach spaces

In [[functional analysis]], given a sequence $a:\mathbb{N} \to B$ in a [[Banach space]] $B$, the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n$ is **absolutely convergent** if the [[sequence]] of [[partial sums]] is a [[Cauchy sequence]] in $B$, and the [[sequence]] of [[partial sums]] of the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \Vert a_n \Vert$ is a Cauchy sequence in the real numbers.

## Idea

A **convex space** (also called **barycentric algebra** and other terms, invented independently many times) is a [[set]] [[extra structure|equipped]] with a notion of taking weighted averages, or convex-[[linear combinations]], of its elements.  Do not confuse this with an (abstract) _[[convex set]]_, which a special kind of convex space, also defined below.

The [[category]] of convex spaces is the category of algebras of a [[Lawvere theory]], being the affine part of the theory of $K$-(semi)modules with only the idempotent operations.  This definition is used by [Meng (1989)](#Meng), and many basic properties of the category are detailed therein.   Equivalently, the category of convex spaces is the [[Eilenberg-Moore category|category of algebras]] of a [[finitary monad]], as explained by [Jacobs (2010)](#Jacobs10) and [Swirszcz](#Swirszcz).

The category of convex spaces is is complete, cocomplete, symmetric monoidal closed under the (usual) tensor product construction, and has a cogenerator [B&ouml;rger and Kemper (1994)](#Borger).   The subcategory consisting of the single object, the unit interval, is dense (left-adequate) in the category.  This follows from Isbell's theorem on left adequate subcategories for algebraic theories, using the fact that the free convex space on 2 elements is the unit interval. 

Axiomatically, a convex space can be characterized as a [[set]] $X$ equipped with a family of [[functions]] $c_p : X \times X \to X$ satisfying some natural [[axioms]] (described below). 

For examples all [[nonunital ring|nonunital]] [[commutative rings]] are convex spaces, with the map $c_p(x,y) = x + p(y-x)$. 

The [[monad]] assigning to any set the free convex space on that set is a [[finitary monad|finitary]] [[commutative monad]] (see [Jacobs (2010)](#Jacobs10)). We can thus follow Durov in thinking of it as a [[generalized ring]].  This allows us to think of convex spaces as 'modules' of a generalized ring, very much as [[vector spaces]] are modules of a field.  This is also true of the relatives of convex spaces: [[affine space|affine spaces]] and [[conical space|conical spaces]].  For example, all **affine spaces** are convex spaces as defined below.

Of particular importance are convex spaces parametrized by the interval $P = [0,1]$ or the Boolean algebra $P = \{0,1\}$. These two algebras are dual, in a certain sense described by [Jacobs (2009)](#Jacobs09). This duality is functorial, and therefore is present for convex spaces for general $P$. This leads to the notion of a [[dual convex space]].

## Definition

A __convex space__ is a [[set]] $X$ equipped with:

* a multiplicatively closed [[subset]] $Q$ of a [[semiring|(semi)]][[ring]] $P$, so that for each element $p\in Q$ there exists an element $q\in Q$ such that $p+q=1$, and

* an operation $c_p: X \times X \to X$ defined for all $p\in Q$,

such that the following identities always hold:

*  $c_0(x,y) = x$,
*  $c_p(x,x) = x$ for all $p \in P$,
*  $c_p(x,y) = c_{1-p}(y,x)$ for all $p \in P$ (in semiring case replace $1-p$ by $q$ and require that $p+q = 1$),
* $c_p(x, c_q(y,z)) = c_{p q}(c_r(x,y),z)$ for all $p,q,r \in P$ satisfying $p(1 - q) = (1 - p q)r$.

As a consequence of the first and third axioms, $c_1(x,y) = c_0(y,x) = y$.

This defines convex spaces as a [[variety of algebras]], with one binary operation for each $p$. 

The intended interpretation is that $c_p(x,y) = x + p(y-x) = (1-p)x + p y$. i.e., $c_p(x,y)$ is the $p$-weighted average of $x$ and $y$, where $x$ gets weight $1-p$ and $y$ gets weight $p$. By thinking of $p$ as a continuous parameter, this interpretation has the advantage of "starting" at $x$, then moving toward $y$ at "rate" $p$.

This interpretation is '[[bias|biased]]', in the sense that the centered choice $p=0$ favors $x$. It is also possible to give an '[[bias|unbiased]]' definition, which characterizes to convex-linear combinations of many points. This is an $n$-ary operation parametrised by a list $p := (p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ satisfying $\sum_{i = 1}^n p_i = 1$. If $x := (x^1,\ldots, x^n)$, then $c_p(x) := \sum_i p_i x^i$.

A [[homomorphism]] of convex spaces may be called a __convex-linear map__ or an __affine linear map__ (since an [[affine space]] is a convex space with extra properties, as in the examples below).  It should probably *not* be called a 'convex map', which (between affine spaces) is something more general.


## Examples

Any real [[vector space]] is a convex space, with $c_p(x,y) = x + p(y-x)$.  In the unbiased version, any convex-linear combination is a [[linear combination]].  Note that a convex-linear map between vector spaces may not be a linear map, since it may not preserve the identity; thus, a vector space is a convex space with [[extra structure]].

More generally, any real [[affine space]] is a convex space; since $p + (1 - p) = 1$, the expression for $c_p$ in a vector space is valid in an affine space.  In the unbiased version, any convex-linear combination is an [[affine linear combination]].  Now any convex-linear map between affine spaces is an affine linear map (and conversely); an affine space is a convex space with [[extra properties]].

Still more generally, any [[convex subset]] (that is, one containing the entire line segment between two given points) of a real [[affine space]] is a convex space (again with extra properties, which are described algebraically below).

The [[Boolean field]] $\{0,1\}$ is a convex space with $c_p(x,y) = x \vee y = x + y - x y$ whenever $0 \lt p \lt 1$ (with $c_0(x,y) = x$ and $c_1(x,y) = y$ as always); this cannot be realised as a subset of a vector space.  This can be generalised to any (possibly unbounded) [[semilattice]].  (It would be nice to find an example like this that can be defined constructively; this one relies on [[excluded middle]].)


## Abstract convex sets

There is a nice abstract converse to the example of a [[convex subset]] of an affine space.  A convex space is __cancellative__ if $y = z$ whenever $c_p(x,y) = c_p(x,z)$ for some $x$ and $p \ne 0$.  We may call a cancellative convex space an __abstract convex set__.  The justification for this terminology is this

+-- {: .un_theorem}
**Theorem** (Thm. 2 in the paper by Stone)

A convex space is cancellative if and only if it is isomorphic (as a convex space) to a convex subset of some real affine space.
=--

Compare this with the theorem that a [[monoid]] is [[cancellative monoid|cancellative]] if and only if it is isomorphic to a submonoid of some [[group]].

Of course, most of the examples given above are cancellative, being manifestly given as convex subsets of real affine space.  However, the last example --- a semilattice with $c_p(x,y) = x \vee y$ whenever $0 \lt p \lt 1$ --- is non-cancellative.

## References

Convex spaces have been rediscovered many times under many different names.  References tend to define $c_p$ only for $0 \lt p \lt 1$, but it seems obvious that it\'s best to include the edge cases as well.  Classically, it makes no difference, but the definition above is probably better in [[constructive mathematics]].

# Indefinite integrals

## Idea

An indefinite integral is something less definite than a [[definite integral]].  Whereas a definite integral is typically some kind of [[number]] or other concrete quantity, an indefinite integral is typically another variable quantity of the same type as the integrand.

The term 'indefinite integral' is itself rather indefinite, having been used for a variety of slightly different concepts.  Both _semidefinite integrals_ and _antiderivatives_ are more precise versions of indefinite integrals.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] is basically the [[theorem]] that these different kinds of indefinite integral are essentially the same thing.


## Definitions and notation

To begin with, we will discuss the [[integration]] of [[real number|real]]-valued [[functions]] on the [[real line]], but much of this can be generalized to other contexts.  So let $f$ be a [[partial function]] from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$; typically, the [[domain]] of $f$ will be an [[interval]], but we do not require this.

+-- {: .num_defn #semi}
###### Definition

If $a$ is a [[real number]] (usually in the domain of $f$, or at least in the domain\'s [[topological closure|closure]]), then the __semidefinite integral__ of $f$ from $a$ (or with __initial point__ $a$) is the function
$$ x \mapsto \int_a^x f(t) \,\mathrm{d}t .$$
(If $x \lt a$, then we must define $\int_a^x$ as $-\int_x^a$.)
=--

The semidefinite integral is defined in terms of the definite integral.  We can put names such as 'Riemann' and 'Lebesgue' between 'semidefinite' and 'integral' to specify a particular kind of definite integral to be used.  Note that the domain of the semidefinite integral is an interval containing $a$ and contained in the domain of $f$ (or at least in its closure if we allow [[improper integral]]s or integrating [[almost functions]]).  If we start by defining $f$ as a [[locally integrable function]] on a closed interval $I$ containing $a$, then the semidefinite integral will also have $I$ as its domain.

The value at $x$ of the semidefinite integral from $a$ may be denoted
$$ \int_a f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x $$
for short.  Notice that this notation has no dummy variable; we only need to introduce the dummy variable $t$ to unfold the definition.  (Indeed, some writers will abuse notation, writing $\int_a^x f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$ for the semidefinite integral.)  But as in $\mathrm{d}y/\mathrm{d}x$, the $x$ here is not a [[free variable]] either, since we cannot freely use substitution; it has to be viewed as [[variable quantity]] instead.  Rather, if you want to evaluate $\int_a f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$ when $x$ is some number $b$, then the notation for this is $\int_a^b f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$, in which $x$ has now become a dummy variable but has not simply been replaced with $b$.

+-- {: .num_defn #semiIV}
###### Definition

If $a$ and $C$ are real numbers (with $a$ in the domain of $f$ or its closure), then the __indefinite integral__ of $f$ from $a$ with __initial value__ $C$ is the function
$$ x \mapsto C + \int_a^x f(t) \,\mathrm{d}t .$$
We may write this value as $C + \int_a f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$ for short.
=--

This is only one of the meanings of 'indefinite integral', but it is the only one that doesn\'t have alternative unambiguous terminology.  Note that $C$ is the value of the indefinite integral at $a$; thus, $C$ is the initial value if $a$ is the initial point.  But for authors who use this concept, there is often no need to mention either $a$ or $C$ (and hence no terminology needed for them), because they are interested only in whether some other function $F$ is an indefinite integral of $f$, where $f$ is a locally integrable function on some closed interval.

+-- {: .num_defn #antider}
###### Definition

If $F$ is a partial function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, then $F$ is an __antiderivative__ of $f$ (or an __antidifferential__ of $f \,\mathrm{d}x$) if $f$ is the [[derivative]] of $F$ on its domain:
$$ \forall\, x \in \dom F,\; f(x) = F'(x) .$$
A posteriori, $F$ must be [[differentiable function|differentiable]].
=--

This is the usual meaning of 'indefinite integral' in modern Calculus textbooks using the [[Riemann integral]], especially when the domain of $f$ is an interval.

+-- {: .num_defn #almostantider}
###### Definition

If $F$ is a Lebesgue-measurable partial [[almost function]] from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, then $F$ is an __almost antiderivative__ of $f$ if $f$ is the derivative of $F$ [[almost everywhere]]:
$$ \operatorname{ess}\forall\, x \in \dom F,\; f(x) = F'(x) .$$
We are especially interested in the case where $F$ is [[absolutely continuous function|absolutely continuous]].
=--

This is not standard terminology, but it fits in well with other 'almost' terminology in [[measure theory]].  This is a common meaning of 'indefinite integral' when using the [[Lebesgue integral]].


## Properties

The main property linking the different kinds of indefinite integral is the _[[fundamental theorem of calculus]]_ (FTC).  For various definitions of integral, one can prove that every semidefinite integral, or more generally any indefinite integral in the sense of Definition \ref{semiIV}, is an antiderivative; and that every antiderivative, or more generally every almost antiderivative, is an indefinite integral; possibly with technical conditions (depending on the type of integral concerned) such as differentiability or absolute continuity.  See that article for details.

Indefinite integrals provide solutions to [[differential equations]].  Of course, the definition of an antiderivative is that it is the solution to a particularly simple differential equation.  Employing the FTC, we see that the indefinite integrals are the solutions to the corresponding initial-value problems.  Specifically, the solution to
$$ F'(x) = f(x),\; F(a) = C $$
is the indefinite integral of $f$ with initial point $a$ and initial value $C$:
$$ F(x) = C + \int_a f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x .$$


## Generalizations

### In cartesian spaces

When $\omega$ is an exterior $1$-form on a subspace $S$ of the [[cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, then we can define an antiderivative (or antidifferential) of $\omega$ to be any real-valued function $f$ on $S$ such that $\mathrm{d}f = \omega$.  Then when $P$ is a point in $S$ (or perhaps its closure), we can define the value of the semidefinite integral of $\omega$ with initial point $P$ to be the integral of $\omega$ along a straight line segment from $P$; the domain is a [[star-convex set]] radiating from $P$ and contained in (the closure of) $S$.  If we define an indefinite integral as a semidefinite integral plus a constant initial value, then every antiderivative of $\omega$ on a star-convex set is an indefinite integral.  Conversely, every indefinite integral is an antiderivative if $\omega$ is closed.  If $\omega$ is not closed, then it still has indefinite integrals (as long as it\'s continuous or otherwise locally integrable), but these are no longer antiderivatives (which non-closed forms never have).

This can perhaps be generalized to [[Riemannian manifolds]] by considering integrals along [[geodesics]]; although the geodesic between two points is not always unique (even when it exists), it is unique on a sufficiently small (and often quite large) neighbourhood.  (For example, on a [[sphere]], as long as $\omega$ is integrable, we can define the indefinite integral this way at every point except the one directly opposite the initial point.)

However, this straight-line definition seems rather artificial, and it might be best to use the more notion of semidefinite integral below, applicable only to closed forms but on more general manifolds.


### On manifolds

We can generalize to [[exterior differential forms]] on [[differentiable manifolds]], generalizing the FTC to the [[Stokes theorem]].  It\'s clear what an antiderivative is in this context: $\alpha$ is an __exterior antiderivative__ of $\omega$ iff $\omega$ is the [[exterior derivative]] of $\alpha$.  On a [[smooth manifold]], we know what 'almost' means and so can also define exterior almost antiderivatives.

If $\omega$ is a $1$-form on any differentiable manifold and $P$ is a point in its domain, then the semidefinite integral of $\omega$ with initial point $P$ is defined at another point $Q$ iff the integral of $\omega$ is the same along any path from $P$ to $Q$ (and then that integral is the value).  We can define an indefinite integral by adding a constant initial value.  Then every antiderivative on a [[path-connected space|path-connected]] domain is an indefinite integral, and conversely every indefinite integral is an antiderivative.  By definition, $\omega$ is exact iff an antiderivative exists, and therefore iff an indefinite integral exists on each [[path-connected component]].  Similarly, $\omega$ is closed iff it has an indefinite integral on a neighbourhood of each point; if the domain of $\omega$ is [[simply-connected space|simply connected]], then the indefinite integral can be extended to the entire domain.

It remains to consider a good notion of semidefinite and indefinite integrals for higher-rank forms.


### In algebraic limit fields

In an [[algebraic limit field]] $F$, the notion of a derivative is well defined and is represented by the [[Newton-Leibniz operator]] $\tilde{D}$. Given a [[subset]] $S \subseteq F$, and a function $f:S \to F$, the set of antiderivatives of $f$ is the [[fiber]] of the [[Newton-Leibniz operator]] at $f$:

$$\{g \in D^1(S, F) \vert \tilde{D}(g) = f\}$$

An __antiderivative__ is an element of the above subset.

## Definition

A power series in a [[variable]] $X$ and with [[coefficients]] in a [[ring]] $R$ is a [[series]] of the form

$$
  \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n X^n
$$

where $a_n$ is in $R$ for each $n\ge 0$. Given that there are
no additional convergence conditions, a power series is also termed emphatically as a __formal power series__. If $R$ is commutative, then the collection of formal power series in a variable $X$ with coefficients in $R$ forms a commutative ring denoted by $R [ [ X ] ]$. 

More generally, a power series in $k$ commuting variables $X_1,\ldots, X_k$ with coefficients in a ring $R$ has the form $\sum_{n_1=0,n_2=0,\ldots, n_k = 0}^\infty a_{n_1\ldots n_k} X_1^{n_1} X_2^{n_2}\cdots X_k^{n_k}$. If $R$ is commutative, then the collection of formal power series in $k$ commuting variables $X_1,\ldots, X_k$ form a formal power series ring denoted by $R [ [ X_1,\ldots, X_k
] ]$. 

More generally, we can consider noncommutative (associative unital) ring $R$ and words in noncommutative 
variables $X_1,\ldots, X_k$ of the form
$$
w = X_{i_1}\cdots X_{i_m}
$$
(where $m$ has nothing to do with $k$) and with coefficient $a_w \in R$ (here $w$ is a word of any length, not a multiindex in the previous sense). Thus the power sum is of the form $\sum_w a_w X_w$ and they form a formal power series ring in variables $X_1,\ldots, X_k$ denoted by $R\langle \langle X_1,\ldots, X_k \rangle\rangle$. Furthermore, $R$ can be even a noncommutative [[semiring]] in which case the words belong to the free monoid on the set $S = \{ X_1,\ldots, X_k\}$, the partial sums are then belong to a monoid semiring $R\langle S\rangle$. The formal power series then also form a semiring, by the multiplication rule
$$
\sum_{r} a_r X_r \cdot \sum b_s X_s = \sum_w \sum_{u,v; w = u v} a_u b_v X_w
$$
Of course, this implies that in a specialization, $b$-s commute with variables $X_{i_k}$; what is usually generalized to take some endomorphisms into an account (like at noncommutative polynomial level of partial sums where we get skew-polynomial rings, i.e. iterated Ore extensions).

## Examples

### Polynomials

For a natural number $k$, a power series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n X^n$ such that $a_n = 0$ for all $n \gt k$ is a [[polynomial]] of degree at most $k$.

### Taylor series

* [[Taylor series]]

### MacLaurin series

For $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ a [[smooth function]] on the [[real line]], and for $f^{(n)} \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ denoting its $n$th [[derivative]] its [[MacLaurin series]] (its [[Taylor series]] at $0$) is the power series

$$
  \sum_{n = 0}^\infty  
   \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(0) x^n
  \,.
$$

If this power series [[convergence|converges]] to $f$, then we say that $f$ is _[[analytic function|analytic]]_.

### Laurent series

* [[Laurent series]]

### Puiseux series
  
* [[Puiseux series]]

## Properties

* An element $a = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots$ in $R[ [x] ]$ is (multiplicatively) invertible iff $a_0$ is invertible. 

This follows easily from the observation that we can invert $1 + x b$ for any power series $b$ by forming $1 - x b + x^2 b^2 - \ldots$ and collecting only finitely many terms in each degree. As a simple corollary, 

* If $R$ is a [[local ring]], then the power series ring $R[ [X] ]$ is also a local ring.

as applied to the set $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The idea is that for each adic $R$-algebra $(S, I)$ and element $(s_1, \ldots s_n) \in I^n$, there is a unique adic algebra map $R[ [x_1, \ldots, x_n] ] \to S$ that sends $x_i$ to $s_i$; this adic algebra map sends a power series $\sum a_{k_1, \ldots, k_n} x_1^{k_1} x_n^{k_n}$ to the sequence of truncations 

$$\left(\sum_{k_1 + \ldots + k_n \lt k} a_{k_1, \ldots, k_n} s_1^{k_1} \ldots s_n^{k_n} \mod I^k\right)_k$$ 

belonging to $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_k S/I^k \cong S$. 
=-- 

It follows that we may define a clone or cartesian operad as follows: the $n^{th}$ component is the set $I_n = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \subset R[ [x_1, \ldots, x_n] ]$ which is the monad value $Ideal Pow(\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\})$. Letting $M$ denote the monad $Ideal \circ Pow$, with monad multiplication $\mu$, and $[n]$ the set $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$, the clone multiplication 

$$I_n \times I_k^n \to I_k$$ 

is the composition of the maps 

$$M(n) \times M(k)^n \cong M(n) \times \hom([n], M(k)) \stackrel{1 \times func}{\to} M(n) \times \hom(M(n), M M(k)) \stackrel{eval}{\to} M M(k) \stackrel{\mu(k)}{\to} M(k)$$ 

The clone multiplication thus defined is called *substitution of power series*; it takes a tuple consisting of $p(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in I_n, q_1(x_1, \ldots x_k) \in I_k, \ldots q_n(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \in I_k)$ to a power series denoted as 

$$p(q_1(x_1, \ldots, x_k), \ldots q_n(x_1, \ldots, x_k)).$$ 

The resulting clone or operad yields, in the particular case $k = n = 1$, an associative substitution operation 

$$x R[ [x] ] \times x R[ [x] ] \stackrel{sub}{\to} x R[ [x] ]$$ 

with $sub(p, q) = p \circ q$ the power series $p(q(x))$. 

+-- {: .num_prop #InvertibleElements} 
###### Proposition 
The group of invertible elements in the substitution monoid $x R[ [x] ]$ consists of power series of the form $a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots$ where $a_1$ is multiplicatively invertible in the ring $R$. 
=-- 

In other words, we can functionally invert a power series provided that the linear coefficient $a_1$ is invertible in $R$. 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Given power series $a = a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots$ and $b = b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + \ldots$, we may read off coefficients of the composite $a \circ b$ as 

$$(a \circ b)_k = \sum_{n \geq 1} a_n \sum_{k = k_1 + \ldots + k_n} b_{k_1} b_{k_2} \ldots b_{k_n}$$ 

where in particular $(a \circ b)_1 = a_1 b_1$. Now $a$ is the left functional inverse of $b$, or $b$ is the right inverse of $a$, if $(a \circ b)(x) = x$, i.e., if $(a \circ b)_k = 1$ if $k = 1$ and $0$ otherwise. The first equation says simply $(a \circ b)_1 = a_1 b_1 = 1$ which implies $a_1$ is invertible. Conversely, if $a_1$ is multiplicatively invertible and $b_1 = a_1^{-1}$, then the equations 

$$\array{
\sum_{n \geq 1} a_n \sum_{k = k_1 + \ldots + k_n} b_{k_1} b_{k_2} \ldots b_{k_n} & = 1\; if\; k = 1 \\ 
 & = 0\; if\; k \neq 1
}$$ 

may be uniquely solved for the remaining $a_i$\'s given the $b_j$\'s, and uniquely solved for the remaining $b_j$\'s given the $a_i$\'s, by an inductive procedure: for $k \neq 1$ we have 

$$a_1 b_k + a_k b_1^k + \; terms\; a_n b_{k_1} \ldots b_{k_n} = 0$$ 

and this allows us to solve for $b_k$, 

$$b_k = -a_1^{-1}(a_k b_1^k + \; terms\; a_n b_{k_1} \ldots b_{k_n})$$ 

given the values $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ and earlier $b$-values $b_{k_j}$ for $k_j \lt k$ given by inductive hypothesis. Similarly we can solve for $a_k$ in terms of given coefficients $b_1, \ldots, b_k$ and earlier $a$-values $a_n$, $n \lt k$. Thus every power series $a$ has a right inverse if $a_1^{-1}$ exists, and $b$ has a left inverse if $b_1^{-1}$ exists, and this completes the proof.

## Ring of power series as rings with infinitesimals

| [[ring]] with [[infinitesimals]] | [[function]] | 
---------------------|-----------------|
| [[dual numbers]] | [[differentiable function]] |
| [[Weil ring]] | [[smooth function]] |
| [[power series ring]] | [[analytic function]] |

### Purely real and purely infinitesimal elements

Suppose that $K$ is a [[Archimedean ordered field]] and $K[[\epsilon]]$ is the ring of power series in $K$. Since $K[[\epsilon]]$ is a [[local ring]], the quotient of $K[[\epsilon]]$ by its ideal of non-invertible elements $\epsilon K[[\epsilon]]$ is the [[residue field]] $K$ itself, and the canonical function used in defining the quotient is the function $\Re:K[[\epsilon]] \to K$ which takes a number $a \in K[[\epsilon]]$ to its purely real component $\Re(a) \in K$ and takes $\Re(\epsilon) = 0$. Since $K[[\epsilon]]$ is an ordered $K$-algebra, there is a [[strictly monotone]] [[ring homomorphism]] $h:K \to K[[\epsilon]]$. An element $a \in K[[\epsilon]]$ is **purely real** if $h(\Re(a)) = a$, and an element $a \in K[[\epsilon]]$ is **purely [[infinitesimal]]** if it is in the [[fiber]] of $\Re$ at $0 \in K$. Zero is the only element in $K[[\epsilon]]$ which is both purely real and purely infinitesimal. 

### Analytic functions

Suppose that $K$ is a [[sequentially Cauchy complete]] [[Archimedean ordered field]] with lattice structure, and $K[[\epsilon]]$ is the ring of power series of $K$. Then [[analytic functions]] are each definable on $K$ using the algebraic, order, metric, and convergence structure on $K$. 

The ring homomorphism $h:K \to K[[\epsilon]]$ preserves [[analytic functions]]: given a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a purely infinitesimal element $\eta \in \epsilon K[[\epsilon]]$, then for every [[analytic function]] $f \in C^\infty(K)$, there is a function $f_{K[[\epsilon]]}:K[[\epsilon]] \to K[[\epsilon]]$ such that for all elements $x \in K$, $f_{K[[\epsilon]]}(h(x)) = h(f(x))$ and 
$$f_{K[[\epsilon]]}(h(x) + \eta) = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i!} h\left(\frac{d^i f}{d x^i}(x)\right) \eta^i$$

## Idea

A [[continuous function]] between two [[topological spaces]] that are each [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the [[circle]] is, up to homotopy, defined by how much it "winds" one circle around the other. This is its _winding number_, an [[integer]]. Equivalently this is the element in the [[fundamental group]] of the codomain which is represented by the map.

A special case of the _[[degree of a continuous function]]_.

## Idea

Let $\Omega$ be a domain in a [[complex manifold]] and let $P \subset \Omega$ be a (complex-) analytic subset which is [[empty subset|empty]] or of [[codimension]] one. A [[holomorphic function]] $f$ defined on the [[complement]] $\Omega \setminus P$ is called a _meromorphic function_ in $\Omega$ if for every point $p \in P$ one can find an arbitrarily small [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $p$ in $\Omega$ and functions $\phi$, $\psi$ holomorphic in $U$ without common non-invertible factors in $Int(U)$, such that $f = \phi/\psi$ in $U \setminus P$.

In one complex dimension (one complex variable), hence on a [[Riemann surface]], a _meromorphic function_ is a [[complex numbers|complex]]-[[analytic function]] which is defined away from a set of isolated points. Equivalently this is a [[holomorphic function]] with values in the [[Riemann sphere]].  Compare a [[holomorphic function]], which is valued in the [[complex plane]] (the Riemann sphere minus a point).

# Directional derivatives
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

A directional derivative, or G&#226;teaux derivative, is a [[partial derivative]] of a [[function]] on a [[manifold]] along the direction given by a [[tangent vector]].


## Definitions

Let $F$ and $G$ be [[locally convex topological vector space]]s, $U \subseteq F$ an [[open subspace]] and $P\colon U \to G$ a [[continuous map]]. The __derivative__ of $P$ at the point $f \in U$ in the __direction__ $h \in F$ is the [[convergence|limit]]
$$
D P_f h = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{1}{t} (P(f + t h) - P(f))
.$$

If the limit exists for every $f \in U$ and every $h \in F$ then one can define a map
$$
D P\colon U \times F \to G
.$$
If the limit exists and $D P$ is [[continuous map|continuous]] (jointly in both variables), we say that $P$ is __[[continuously differentiable map|continuously differentiable]]__ or $C^1$.

A simple but nontrivial example is the operator
$$
P\colon C^{\infty}[a, b] \to C^{\infty}[a, b]
$$
given by
$$
P(f) \coloneqq f f'
$$
with the derivative
$$
D P(f) h = f' h + f h'
.$$

In the context of a [[Fréchet space]], it may be that the directional derivative in every direction exists but the [[Fréchet derivative]] does not; however the existence of Fr&#233;chet derivative implies the existence of directional derivatives in all directions. 

The notion of directional derivatives extends to [[smooth manifolds]] (including infinite-dimensional ones based on [[Fréchet spaces]]) using local coordinates; the differentiability does not depend on the choice of a local chart. In this case we have (if everything is defined)
$$
D P\colon T(U) \to G
,$$
where $T(U)$ is the [[tangent space]] of $U$ (an open subspace of $T(F)$.

# Partial differentiation
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

When a [[multifunction]] is differentiated with respect to any one of its [[variable|arguments]] alone, holding the others fixed, then we are engaged in _partial_ [[differentiation]].


## Definition

Very generally, let $(X_i)_i$ be a [[family]] of [[differentiable spaces]] (in some sense), let $Y$ be another such space, and let $f$ be a [[differentiable map]] to $Y$ from a [[subspace]] $U$ of the [[cartesian product]] $\prod_i X_i$.  Let $d$ be a relevant [[differential]] or [[derivative]] operator, and let $x_i$ be the composite
$$ U \hookrightarrow \prod_i X_i \twoheadrightarrow X_i $$
of the [[inclusion map]] of $U$ and the $i$th [[product projection]] (the $i$th [[coordinate]]).  Then under good conditions, we have
$$ d{f} = \sum_i \partial_i{f} \,d{x_i} $$
for a unique family $(\partial_i{f})_i$ of [[linear operators]], the __partial derivatives__ of $f$ with respect to this decomposition of $U$.  The term $\partial_i{f} \,d{x_i}$, which may be denoted $d_i{f}$, is similarly a __partial differential__ of $f$.

More precisely, we choose a [[category]] of [[differentiable spaces]] and differentiable maps between them, on which there is an [[endofunctor]] that takes each space $U$ to a notion of [[tangent bundle]] $T{U}$, which is assumed to be a [[vector bundle]] over $U$, and takes a map $f\colon U \to Y$ to $d{f}\colon T{U} \to T{Y}$.  (Note that this isn't the case for [[generalised smooth spaces]], but we could take [[microlinear spaces]], as well as more familiar examples such as [[differentiable manifolds]].)  Then $d{x_i}\colon T{U} \to T{X_i}$, $\partial_i{f}_p\colon T_{x_i(p)}{X_i} \to T_{f(p)}{Y}$ is a linear operator between [[stalks]] (for $p$ a [[point]] in $U$), and the sum takes place in the [[vector space]] $T_{f(p)}{Y}$.

We can extend this if we work in a [[cartesian closed category]] of [[generalised smooth spaces]].  As in the above, let $(X_i)_{i \in I}$ be a [[family]] of [[smooth spaces]] and $Y$ another smooth space.  For simplicity, let $f \colon \prod_i X_i \to Y$ be a smooth map (aka [[morphism]] in the category) defined on the whole product (so we take $U = \prod_i X_i$ in the above).  For $i_0 \in I$ we can use the cartesian closed structure to define a morphism 

$$
C^\infty(\prod_i X_i, Y) \xrightarrow{\cong} C^\infty(\prod_{i \ne i_0} X_i, C^\infty(X_{i_0},Y)).
$$

Thus given a morphism $f \colon \prod_i X_i \to Y$ we get a parametrised family of morphisms $X_{i_0} \to Y$ which we could write (using parameters) as $f(x_{\widehat{i_0}})(x_{i_0})$.  As taking the derivative is a smooth functor, we can *partially* differentiate the morphisms by applying differentiation to the morphisms $X_{i_0} \to Y$, thus yielding $d f_{i_0}(x_{\widehat{i_0}})(x_{i_0},v)$ as a morphism $\prod_{i \ne i_0} X_i \to C^\infty(T X_{i_0}, T Y)$.  In full, $d f_{i_0}$ is the image of $f$ under the chain of morphisms:

$$
C^\infty(\prod_i X_i, Y) \xrightarrow{\cong} C^\infty(\prod_{i \ne i_0} X_i, C^\infty(X_{i_0},Y)) \xrightarrow{C^\infty(\prod_{i \ne i_0} X_i, -)} C^\infty(\prod_{i \ne i_0} X_i, C^\infty(T X_{i_0}, T Y)).
$$

This is the **partial derivative** of $f$ along $X_{i_0}$.


## Notation

When the coordinates $x_i$ are given individual names $u, v, w, \ldots$, one usually writes $\partial{f}/\partial{u}$ for $\partial_i{f}$ (where $u$ replaces $x_i$); but $(\partial{f}/\partial{u})_{v,w,\ldots}$ is less ambiguous.  Similarly, one can write $(d{f})_{v,w,\ldots}$ for the partial differential $(\partial{f}/\partial{u})_{v,w,\ldots} \,d{u}$, which is $d_i{f}$ when $u$ replaces $x_i$.  (If $d{f}$ is thought of as an [[infinitesimal]] change in $f$, then $(d{f})_{v,w,\ldots}$ is an infinitesimal change subject to the condition that $v,w,\ldots$ are _fixed_.)  Then
$$ \left(\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{u}}\right)_{v,w,\ldots} = \frac{(d{f})_{v,w,\ldots}}{d{u}} = \frac{(d{f})_{v,w,\ldots}}{(d{u})_{v,w,\ldots}} ,$$
which explains the notation and why '$\partial$' looks like '$d$'.  (The reason for the latter equality is that $\partial_i{x_j}$ is the [[Kronecker delta]] $\delta_{i,j}$.)

## Definition

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[Riemannian manifold]] and $f \in C^\infty(X)$ a [[function]].

The **gradient** of $f$ is the [[vector field]]

$$
  \nabla f := g^{-1} d_{dR} f \in \Gamma(T X)
  \,,
$$

where $d_{dR} : C^\infty(X) \to \Omega^1(X)$ is the [[de Rham differential]].

This is the unique vector field $\nabla f$ such that 

$$
  d_{dR} f = g(-,\nabla f)
$$

or equivalently, if the manifold is [[oriented]],  this is the unique vector field such that

$$
  d_{dR} f = \star_g \iota_{\nabla f} vol_g
  \,,
$$

where $vol_g$ is the [[volume form]] and $\star_g$ is the [[Hodge star operator]] induced by $g$.  (The result is independent of [[orientation]], which can be made explicit by interpreting both $vol$ and $\star$ as valued in [[pseudoforms]].)

Alternatively, the gradient of a scalar field $A$ in some point $x\in M$ is calculated (or alternatively defined) by the integral formula 

$$
grad A = lim_{vol D\to 0} \frac{1}{vol D} \oint_{\partial D} \vec{n} A d S
$$

where $D$ runs over the domains with smooth boundary $\partial D$ containing point $x$ and $\vec{n}$ is the unit vector of outer normal to the surface $S$. The formula does not depend on the shape of boundaries taken in limiting process, so one can typically take a coordinate chart and balls with decreasing radius in this particular coordinate chart. 


## Example

If $(M,g)$ is the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with the standard Euclidean metric, then

$$
\nabla f= \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\partial_i
.$$

This is the classical gradient from [[vector analysis]].


## Remark

In many classical applications of the gradient in [[vector analysis]], the Riemannian structure is actually irrelevant, and the gradient can be replaced with the [[differential form|differential 1-form]].

# Line integrals
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

A _line integral_ is an [[integral]] along a [[curve]].  These are sometimes called _path integrals_ (not to be confused with the [[path integral]] in [[quantum physics]], which is integration over a space of curves rather than along a curve in some space) and _[[contour integrals]]_ (especially in [[complex analysis]]).

By the modern understanding of the [[integration of differential forms]], one integrates [[differential 1-forms]] ([[cotangent vector fields]]) along [[orientation|oriented]] [[curves]], and so this would be the natural way to understand a line integral.  However, there are several slightly different line integrals, and not all of them are reducible to integration of $1$-forms along oriented curves.  Sometimes we have to fall back on more basic notions, ultimately the integration of [[pseudoform|pseudo]]-$1$-forms on a $1$-dimensional space.


## Definitions

Here we assume familiarity with integration of differential forms and pseudoforms, defining in terms of them the various classical notions of line integral.

In each case, the classical notation (developed before the rigorous treatment of analysis in the 19th century) is not taken literally by the classical definition (developed after the rigorous treatment and still found in calculus texts), and this definition is accompanied by a [[parametrization|reparametrisation]] theorem.  We would like to make sense of the classical notation and eliminate the reparametrisation theorems (or at least make them all special cases of [a general theorem to be proved once for all](differential+form#IntegrationTheorem)) using differential forms.  Often we find that we can relax some of the restrictions in the classical definition as well.


### Line integral of a vector field

Classically, we have a [[Cartesian space]] $X$, a [[continuous map]] $\vec{F}\colon X \to X$, and a [[continuously differentiable map]] $C\colon [a,b] \to X$; the __line integral__ of $\vec{F}$ along $C$ is defined as
$$ \int_C \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r} \coloneqq \int_a^b \vec{F}(C(t)) \cdot C'(t) \,\mathrm{d}t ,$$
where the integral on the right is a [[Riemann integral]] and $C'$ is the [[derivative]] of $C$ componentwise.  If $\phi\colon [e,f] \to [a,b]$ is a continuously differentiable [[monotone function|increasing]] [[bijection]], then
$$ \int_{C \circ \phi} \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r} = \int_C \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r} ,$$
the reparametrisation theorem.

We can start to justify the classical notation by interpreting $\vec{r}$ as the same map $[a,b] \to X$ as $C$; then we have
$$ \int_C \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r} \coloneqq \int_a^b \vec{F}(\vec{r}(t)) \cdot \vec{r}'(t) \,\mathrm{d}t ,$$
in which case the classical notation simply seems to be suppressing some of the notation in the formal definition on the right.  In particular, we interpret $\mathrm{d}\vec{r}$ as meaning $\vec{r}'(t) \,\mathrm{d}t$.

But this suggests that we should really be looking at differential forms.  Since $X$ is a Cartesian space, we may identify it with any of its [[tangent spaces]] and so identify $\vec{F}$ with a [[tangent vector field]] on $X$, or equivalenty a vector-valued $0$-form.  Since $\vec{r}$ is only serving to parametrise the curve, it should be interpreted as something trivial, in this case the [[identity map]] on $X$, also viewed as a vector-valued $0$-form.  Then $\mathrm{d}\vec{r}$ is a vector-valued $1$-form (which we can do since a Cartesian space has a trivial [[connection]]), and $\vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r}$ is an ordinary $1$-form.  Finally, since the curve $C$ is given up to an increasing reparametrisation, it is an [[orientation|oriented]] $1$-submanifold of $X$.  Now we may interpret the notation
$$ \int_C \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r} $$
literally as the integral of a $1$-form.  It is now no longer necessary that $C$ be given by a continuously differentiable parametrisation; the vector-valued $0$-form $\vec{r}$ is continuously differentiable regardless, and so we only need $C$ to be a [[rectifiable curve]] (although it is a theorem that such a curve must have a parametrisation ---by [[arclength]] if nothing else--- that is continuously differentiable [[almost everywhere]], so that the classical definition still covers this using a [[Riemann integral]]).

However, this operation from $\vec{F}$ to $\vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r}$ is something more fundamental in differential geometry; in fact, $\vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r}$ is simply $\vec{F}^\flat$, the [[cotangent vector field]] that corresponds to the tangent vector field $\vec{F}$.  Understanding this, we wish to generalise $X$ to any (pseudo)-[[Riemannian manifold]].  In this case, we cannot interpret $\vec{r}$ literally, but we may still interpret $\mathrm{d}\vec{r}$ as a vector-valued $1$-form, indeed as the tautological one that (viewing a $1$-form as an operation on vector fields) is the [[identity map]] on vector fields.  With this understanding, the classical notation still makes sense, although it is probably easier to write
$$ \int_C \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r} = \int_C \vec{F}^\flat $$
as the most general definition of the line integral of a vector field along an oriented curve in a (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold.


### Line integral of a scalar field

Classically, we again have a [[Cartesian space]] $X$, now a [[continuous map]] $f$ from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, and again a [[continuously differentiable map]] $C\colon [a,b] \to X$; the __line integral__ of $f$ along $C$ is defined as
$$ \int_C f \mathrm{d}s \coloneqq \int_a^b f(C(t)) {\|C'(t)\|} \,\mathrm{d}t ,$$
where again the integral on the right is a [[Riemann integral]] and $C'$ is the [[derivative]] of $C$ componentwise.  If $\phi\colon [e,f] \to [a,b]$ is a continuously differentiable [[bijection]] (whether increasing *or* decreasing), then
$$ \int_{C \circ \phi} f \mathrm{d}s = \int_C f \mathrm{d}s ,$$
the reparametrisation theorem.

We cannot interpret $\mathrm{d}s$ as the differential of anything; rather, $\mathrm{d}s$ is the magnitude of the line integral element $\mathrm{d}\vec{r}$ from the previous section. In particular, identifying $\vec{r}$ with $C$ again, we have
$$ \int_C f \mathrm{d}s \coloneqq \int_a^b f(\vec{r}(t)) {\|\vec{r}'(t)\|} \,\mathrm{d}t ,$$
so $\mathrm{d}s$ seems to mean ${\|\vec{r}'(t)\|} \,\mathrm{d}t$.  Using the standard orientation on $[a,b]$ to change the $1$-form $\mathrm{d}t$ to the pseudo-$1$-form ${|\mathrm{d}t|}$, this is consistent with $\mathrm{d}s = {\|\mathrm{d}\vec{r}\|}$.

But for this to really make sense, we have to see what kind of object $\mathrm{d}s$ is on $X$.  It is neither a $1$-form (which can be integrated along an oriented curve) nor a pseudo-$1$-form (which can be integrated along a pseudo-oriented curve, that is a transversely oriented curve); it is instead an *[[absolute differential form|absolute]]* $1$-form, which can be integrated along an *unoriented* curve.  If we interpret $\mathrm{d}\vec{r}$ as the canonical vector-valued $1$-form again, then we can take its magnitude to get a positive semidefinite (nonnegative-scalar-valued, and in this case actually definite) absolute $1$-form, so $\mathrm{d}s = {\|\mathrm{d}\vec{r}\|}$ is literally true.

It would be nice to have notation without fake differentials and with the one piece of structure that actually plays a role: the metric.  If we multiply two $1$-forms using the [[symmetric product]] (instead of the [[exterior product]] as usual for differential forms), then we get a symmetric [[bilinear form]], and in this way the (symmetric) square of the arclength element $\mathrm{d}s$ is the metric $g$.  Since $\mathrm{d}s$ is positive, we can reasonably call it the *principal* [[square root]] of $g$.  Thus,
$$ \int_C f \mathrm{d}s = \int_C f \sqrt{g} $$
defines the line integral of a scalar field along an unoriented curve in a Riemannian manifold.

On a *pseudo*-Riemannian manifold, $g$ itself may not be positive and so may not have a square root.  In that case, we can take the absolute value of $g$ first and use
$$ \int_C f \mathrm{d}s = \int_C f \sqrt{|g|} ,$$
although this is most intuitive for curves that are consistently [[timelike curve|timelike]] or [[spacelike curve|spacelike]].  It\'s also possible to keep the previous formula and allow one of these two types of curve to have [[purely imaginary number|imaginary]] arclength; which one depends on conventions.  In any case, a line integral along a [[lightlike curve]] is zero.


### Contour integral of a complex function

Classically, we have the [[complex plane]] $\mathbb{C}$, a [[continuous map]] $f\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$, and a [[continuously differentiable map]] $C\colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{C}$; the __[[contour integral]]__ (or __line integral__ again) of $f$ along $C$ is defined as
$$ \int_C f \mathrm{d}z \coloneqq \int_a^b f(C(t)) C'(t) \,\mathrm{d}t ,$$
where the integral on the right is a [[Riemann integral]] and $C'$ is the [[derivative]] of $C$.  If $\phi\colon [e,f] \to [a,b]$ is a continuously differentiable [[monotone function|increasing]] [[bijection]], then
$$ \int_{C \circ \phi} f \mathrm{d}z = \int_C f \mathrm{d}z ,$$
the reparametrisation theorem.

We start to justify the classical notation by interpreting $z$ as the same map $[a,b] \to \mathbb{C}$ as $C$; then we have
$$ \int_C f \mathrm{d}z \coloneqq \int_a^b f(z(t)) z'(t) \,\mathrm{d}t ,$$
in which case the classical notation seems again to be suppressing some of the notation in the formal definition.  In particular, $\mathrm{d}z$ is interpreted as $z'(t) \,\mathrm{d}t$.

But again, we should really be looking at differential forms.  We may identify the space $\mathbb{C}$ with the [[scalar field]] and so identify $f$ with a [[scalar field]] on $\mathbb{C}$, or equivalenty a $0$-form.  Since $z$ is only serving to parametrise the curve, it should be interpreted as the [[identity map]] on $\mathbb{C}$, also viewed as a $0$-form.  Then $\mathrm{d}z$ is a $1$-form, and $f \mathrm{d}z$ is a $1$-form.  Finally, since the curve $C$ is given up to an increasing reparametrisation, it is an [[orientation|oriented]] $1$-submanifold of $X$.  Now we may interpet the notation
$$ \int_C f \mathrm{d}z $$
literally as the integral of a $1$-form.  It is now no longer necessary that $C$ be given by a continuously differentiable parametrisation; the vector-valued $0$-form $z$ is continuously differentiable regardless, and so we only need $C$ to be a [[rectifiable curve]] (although it is a theorem that such a curve must have a continuously differentiable parametrisation after all).


### Absolute contour integral of a complex function

Classically, we have the [[complex plane]] $\mathbb{C}$, a [[continuous map]] $f\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$, and a [[continuously differentiable map]] $C\colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{C}$; the __absolute contour integral__ (or whatever one calls it) of $f$ along $C$ is defined as
$$ \int_C f {|\mathrm{d}z|} \coloneqq \int_a^b f(C(t)) {|C'(t)|} \,\mathrm{d}t ,$$
where the integral on the right is a [[Riemann integral]] and $C'$ is the [[derivative]] of $C$.  If $\phi\colon [e,f] \to [a,b]$ is a continuously differentiable [[bijection]] (whether increasing or decreasing), then
$$ \int_{C \circ \phi} f {|\mathrm{d}z|} = \int_C f {|\mathrm{d}z|} ,$$
the reparametrisation theorem.

As before, if $z$ is interpreted as the same map $[a,b] \to \mathbb{C}$ as $C$; then we have
$$ \int_C f {|\mathrm{d}z|} \coloneqq \int_a^b f(z(t)) {|z'(t)|} \,\mathrm{d}t ,$$
so ${|\mathrm{d}z|}$ seems to mean ${|z'(t)|} \,\mathrm{d}t$.  As before, if we use the standard orientation on $[a,b]$ to change the $1$-form $\mathrm{d}t$ to the pseudo-$1$-form ${|\mathrm{d}t|}$, then ${|\mathrm{d}z|}$ is the absolute value of $\mathrm{d}z$ from before.

Of course, we should really be looking at differential forms.  Again, $f$ is a [[scalar field]] on $\mathbb{C}$, or equivalenty a $0$-form.  Again $z$ is the [[identity map]] on $\mathbb{C}$, viewed as a $0$-form.  Then $\mathrm{d}z$ is a $1$-form, its absolute value ${|\mathrm{d}z|}$ is a (positive definite) [[absolute form|absolute]] $1$-form, and $f {|\mathrm{d}z|}$ is a (more general) absolute $1$-form.  Since $C$ is given up to an arbitrary reparametrisation, it is an unoriented $1$-submanifold of $X$, which is just what we need for an absolute $1$-form.  Now we may interpet the notation
$$ \int_C f {|\mathrm{d}z|} $$
literally as the integral of an absolute $1$-form.

This is actually a special case of the line integral of a scalar field, since
$$ {|\mathrm{d}z|} = {|\mathrm{d}(x + \mathrm{i}y)|} = {|\mathrm{d}x + \mathrm{i} \,\mathrm{d}y|} = \sqrt{(\mathrm{d}x)^2 + (\mathrm{d}y)^2} = \sqrt{g} = \mathrm{d}s ,$$
since $\mathrm{d}x^2 + \mathrm{d}y^2$ is the standard metric on $\mathbb{C}$.

## Definition

### Of a subset

The __characteristic function__ of a [[subset]] $U$ of some [[set]] $X$ is a [[function]] from $X$ to the set $TV$ of [[truth values]] (which classically is $TV = \{\bot,\top\}$) that takes $a$ in $X$ to the truth value of the statement that $a \in U$.  That is,
$$ \chi_U(a) \;\Leftrightarrow\; a \in U ,$$
where $\chi_U$ (also often $1_U$) is the characteristic function of $U$.

### Of a subobject

More generally, the __characteristic morphism__ of a [[subobject]] $U$ of some objects $X$ in a category with a [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ is the morphism from $X$ to $\Omega$ that classifies $U$; we have that
$$ \array {
  U          & \hookrightarrow    & X \\
  \downarrow &                    & \downarrow & \chi_U \\
  1          & \underset{\top}\to & \Omega
} $$
is a [[pullback]] square.

## Idea

A [[function]] which is [[differentiable function]] to arbitrary order is called a _smooth function_.

### In the real numbers

#### Epsilon-delta definition

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the [[real numbers]]. A function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is **smooth** if it comes with a [[sequence]] of functions $D^{(-)}f:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R})$ and a sequence of functions $M^{(-)}f:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{Q}_+ \to \mathbb{Q}_+)$ in the positive rational numbers, such that 

* for every real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $(D^{0}f)(x) = f(x)$

* for every natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, for every positive rational number $\epsilon \in \mathbb{Q}_+$, for every real number $h \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $0 \lt | h | \lt M^{n}f(\epsilon)$, and for every real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$, 
$$|(D^{n}f)(x + h) - (D^{n}f)(x) - h (D^{n + 1}f)(x)| \lt \epsilon |h|$$

Unwrapping the recursive definition above, a function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is **smooth** if it comes with a [[sequence]] of functions $D^{(-)}f:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R})$ and a sequence of functions $M^{(-)}f:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{Q}_+ \to \mathbb{Q}_+)$ in the positive rational numbers, such that 

* for every real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $(D^{0}f)(x) = f(x)$

* for every natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, for every positive rational number $\epsilon \in \mathbb{Q}_+$, for every real number $h \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $0 \lt | h | \lt M^{n}f(\epsilon)$, and for every real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$, 
$$\left|f(x + h) - \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{h^i (D^{i}f)(x)}{i!}\right| \lt \epsilon |h^n|$$

#### Infintesimal definition

Given a predicate $P$ on the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, let $I$ denote the set of all elements in $\mathbb{R}$ for which $P$ holds. A [[partial function]] $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is equivalently a function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ for any such predicate $P$ and set $I$. 

A function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ is **smooth at a subset** $S \subseteq I$ with injection $j:S \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if it has a function $\frac{d^{-} f}{d x^{-}}:\mathbb{N} \times S \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\frac{d^0 f}{d x^0}\left(a\right) = a$ for all $a \in S$, such that for all Archimedean ordered Artinian local $\mathbb{R}$-algebras $A$ with ring homomorphism $h_A:\mathbb{R} \to A$ and [[nilradical]] $D$, natural numbers $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and purely infinitesimal elements $\epsilon \in D$ such that $\epsilon^{n + 1} = 0$
$$f_A(h_A(j(a)) + \epsilon) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \frac{1}{i!} h_A\left(\frac{d^i f}{d x^i}\left(a\right)\right) \epsilon^i$$ 

A function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ is **smooth at an element** $a \in I$ if it is smooth at the [[singleton subset]] $\{a\}$, and a function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ is **smooth** if it is smooth at the [[improper subset]] of $I$. 

### Between Cartesian spaces

A [[function]] on (some open subset of) a [[cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with values in the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ is **smooth**, or __infinitely differentiable__, if all its [[derivative]]s exist at all points. More generally, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is any subset, a function $f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined to be _smooth_ if it has a smooth extension to an open subset containing $A$. 

By [[coinduction]]: A [[function]] $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is _smooth_ if (1) its [[derivative]] exists and (2) the derivative is itself a smooth function. 

For $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, a **smooth map** $\phi: A \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is a function such that $\pi \circ \phi$ is a smooth function for every linear functional $\pi: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}$. (In the case of finite-dimensional codomains as here, it suffices to take the $\pi$ to range over the $m$ coordinate projections.) 

The concept can be generalised from cartesian spaces to [[Banach spaces]] and some other infinite-dimensional spaces.  There is a [[locale]]-based analogue suitable for [[constructive mathematics]] which is not described as a function of points but as a special case of a [[continuous map]] (in the localic sense).

### Between smooth manifolds

A [[topological manifold]] whose transition functions are smooth maps is a [[smooth manifold]]. A smooth function between smooth manifolds is a function that (co-)restricts to a smooth function between subsets of Cartesian spaces, as above, with respect to any choice of [[atlases]], hence which is a $k$-fold [[differentiable function]] (see there for more details), for all $k$ The [[category]] [[Diff]] is the category whose objects are smooth manifolds and whose morphisms are smooth maps betweeen them.

### Between generalized smooth spaces

There are various [[categories]] of [[generalised smooth spaces]] whose [[morphisms]] are generalized [[smooth functions]].

For details see for example at _[[smooth set]]_.


## Properties

Basic facts about smooth functions are

* the [[Hadamard lemma]]

* [[Borel's theorem]]

* the [[Tietze extension theorem]]

* the [[Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem]]

* [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]]

## Examples

Every [[analytic functions]] (for instance a [[holomorphic function]]) is also a smooth function.

A crucial property of smooth functions, however, is that they contain also [[bump functions]].

## Idea

A _partition of unity_ is a [[partition]] of the unit function on a [[topological space]] into a sum of continuous functions that are each non-zero only on small parts of the space.


## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. A **partition of unity** on $X$ is a collection $\{u_j\}_{j \in J}$ of [[continuous functions]] $u_j \colon X \to [0,1]$, $j\in J$ to the [[closed interval]] with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] such that $\sum_{j \in J} u_j(x) = 1$ for all $x\in X$.

A partition of unity defines an [[open cover]] of $X$, consisting of the open sets $u_j^{-1}(0,1]$. Call this the **induced cover**.

Given a [[cover]] $\mathcal{U} = \{U_j\}_{j\in J}$ of a [[topological space]] ([[open cover]] or closed or neither), the partition of unity $\{u_j\}_J$ is **subordinate** to $\mathcal{U}$ if for all $j\in J$,
$$\overline{u_j^{-1}(0,1]} \subset U_j.$$

What this means is that the open sets $u_j^{-1}(0,1]$ form an open cover _refining_ the cover $\mathcal{U}$.

A partition of unity is __point finite__ if for every $x\in X$ there is only a [[finite number]] of $j\in J$ such that $u_j(x) \neq 0$.

A partition of unity is __locally finite__ if for every $x\in X$ there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that for only a [[finite number]] of $j\in J$ there is $x\in U$ such that $u_j(x) \neq 0$.

{#Harmless} Often, the property of local finiteness is included in the definition of a partition of unity. This is harmless, since a result due to [[Michael R. Mather]] (Prop. \ref{MatherTheorem} below) says that for any partition of unity we can find a locally finite partition of unity with the same indexing set and whose induced cover refines the original induced cover.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example #PartitionOfUnityOnTheRealLine}
###### Example

Consider $\mathbb{R}$ with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]].

Let $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$  and consider the [[open cover]]
$$
  \{
    (n-1-\epsilon , n+1 +  \epsilon) \subset \mathbb{R}
  \}_{n \in \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R} }.
$$

Then a partition of unity $\{ f_n \colon \mathbb{R} \to [0,1] \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ subordinate to this cover is given by
$$
  f_n(x)
    \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
      x - (n - 1)  &\vert& n - 1 \leq x \leq n
      \\
      1- (x-n) &\vert& n \leq x \leq n+1
      \\
      0 &\vert& \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right\}.

## Properties

### Existence on paracompact topological spaces

+-- {: .num_prop #ParacompactHausdorffEquivalentToexistenceOfParititionsOfUnity}
###### Proposition
**([[paracompact Hausdorff spaces equivalently admit subordinate partitions of unity]])**

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] then:

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $(X,\tau)$ is a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]].

1. Every [[open cover]] of $(X,\tau)$ admits a subordinate partition of unity.

=--

Similarly [[normal spaces]] are equivalently those such that every [[locally finite cover]] has a subordinate partition of unity (reference Bourbaki, Topology Generale - find this!)

### The case of non-Hausdorff spaces

Slightly more generally,
a [[topological space]] (not necessarily Hausdorff)
is [[fully normal topological space|fully normal]] if and only every [[open cover]] admits a subordinate partition of unity.

A [[T1-space]] is [[fully normal topological space|fully normal]] if and only if it is [[paracompact]],
in which case it is also Hausdorff.

For [[topological spaces]] that are not [[T1-spaces]],
the condition of being [[fully normal topological space|fully normal]] is strictly stronger than [[paracompactness]].

### The case of locales

A [[regular locale]] is [[fully normal topological space|fully normal]] if and only if it is [[paracompact]].

The usual proof of the existence of partitions of unity
goes through for such locales since it does not make any use of points.

### Existence on smooth manifolds
 {#ExistenceOnSmoothManifolds}

Paracompact [[smooth manifolds]] admit locally finite _smooth_ partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover (this follows from the existence of a smooth [[bump function]] on $[-1,1]$). It is not true, however, that [[analytic manifolds]] have analytic partitions of unity - the aforementioned [[bump function]] is smooth but not analytic:

+-- {: .num_lemma #SmoothManifoldClosedBallRefinementOfCover}
###### Lemma
**([[open cover]] of [[smooth manifold]] admits [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[refinement]] by [[closed balls]])**

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and let 
$\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]]. 
Then there exists cover

$$
  \left\{
    B_0(\epsilon_j) 
      \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\to}
    V_j
      \subset 
    X
  \right\}_{i \in J}
$$

which is a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[refinement]] of $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ with each patch [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to a [[closed ball]] in [[Euclidean space]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the special case that $X$ is [[compact topological space]]. 

Let 

$$
  \left\{
    \mathbb{R}^n
      \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_j}{\longrightarrow}
    V_j
    \subset X
  \right\}
$$

be a smooth [[atlas]] representing the [[smooth structure]] on $X$. The [[intersections]]

$$
  \left\{
    U_i \cap V_j
  \right\}_{i \in I, j \in J}
$$

still form an open cover of $X$. Hence for each point $x \in X$ there is $i \in I$ and $j \in J$ with $x \in U_i \cap V_j$. By the nature of the [[Euclidean topology]], there exists a [[closed ball]] $B_x$ around $\phi_j^{-1}(x)$ in $\phi_j^{-1}(U_i \cap V_j) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. Its [[image]] $\phi_j(B_x) \subset X$ is a neighbourhood of  $x \in X$ diffeomorphic to a closed ball.

The [[interiors]] of these balls form an [[open cover]]

$$
  \left\{
    Int(B_x)
     \subset 
    X
  \right\}_{x \in X}
$$
 
of $X$ which, by construction, is a refinement of $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$. By the assumption that $X$ is compact, this has a finite subcover

$$
  \left\{
    Int(B_l)
    \subset 
    X
  \right\}_{l \in L}
$$

for $L$ a [[finite set]]. Hence 

$$
  \left\{
    B_l
    \subset 
    X
  \right\}_{l \in L}
$$

is a finite cover by closed balls, hence in particular locally finite, and by construction it is still a refinement of the orignal cover.
This shows the statement for $X$ compact.

Now for general $X$, notice that without restriction we may assume that $X$ is [[connected topological space|connected]], for if it is not, then we obtain the required refinement on all of $X$ by finding one on each [[connected component]].

But if a locally Euclidean paracompact Hausdorff space $X$ is connected, then it is [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]] and in fact admits a countable increasing exhaustion

$$
  V_0 \subset V_1 \subset V_2 \subset \cdots
$$

by [[open subsets]] whose [[topological closures]]

$$
  K_0 \subset K_1 \subset K_2 \subset \cdots
$$

exhaust $X$ by [[compact topological space|compact]] subspaces $K_n$ (by the proof of [this prop.](topological+manifold#RegularityConditionsForTopologicalManifoldsComparison)).

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the open subspace

$$
  V_{n+2} \setminus K_{n-1}
    \;\subset\;
  X
$$

which canonically inherits the structure of a smooth manifold ([this prop.](differentiable+manifold#OpenSubsetsOfDifferentiableManifoldsAreDifferentiableManifolds)). As above we find a refinement of the restriction of $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ to this open subset by closed balls and since the further subspace $K_{n+1}\setminus K_n$ is still compact (by [this lemma](compact+space#UnionsAndIntersectionOfCompactSubspaces)) there is a finite set $L_n$ such that 

$$
  \{B_{l_n} \subset V_{n+2} \setminus K_{n-1} \subset X \}_{l_n \in L_n}
$$

is a finite cover of $K_{n+1} \setminus K_n$ by closed balls refining the original cover.


It follows that the union of all these 

$$
  \left\{
   B_{l_n} \subset X
  \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}, l_n \in L_n}
$$

is a refinement by closed balls as required. Its local finiteness follows by the fact that each $B_{l_n}$ is contained in the "strip" $V_{n+2} \setminus K_{n-1}$, each strip contains only a finite set of $B_{l_n}$-s and each strip intersects only a finite number of other strips. (Hence an open subset around a point $x$ which intersects only a finite number of elements of the refined cover is given by any one of the balls $B_{l_n}$ that contain $x$.)

###### Proposition
**([[smooth manifolds]] admit locally finite smooth partitions of unity)**

Let $X$ be a paracompact [[smooth manifold]]. Then every [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ has a subordinate partition of unity by functions $\{f_i \colon U_i \to \mathbb{R}\}_{i \in I}$ which are _[[smooth functions]]_.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{SmoothManifoldClosedBallRefinementOfCover} the given cover
has a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[refinement]]
by [[closed subsets]] [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to [[closed balls]]:

$$
  \left\{
    B_0(\epsilon_j) 
      \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\to}
    V_j
      \subset 
    X
  \right\}_{j \in J}
  \,.
$$

Given this, let

$$
  h_j \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

be the function which on $V_j$ is given by a smooth [[bump function]] 

$$
  b_j \;\colon\; \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

with [[support]]  $supp(b_j) = B_0(\epsilon_j)$:

$$
  h_j
  \;\colon\;
  x 
  \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      b_j(\psi_j^{-1}(x)) &\vert& x \in V_j
      \\
      0 &\vert& \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

By the nature of [[bump functions]] this is indeed a [[smooth function]] on all of $X$. By local finiteness of the cover by closed balls, the function

$$
  h \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

given by

$$
  h(x) 
    \coloneqq 
  \underset{j \in J}{\sum} h_j(x)
$$

is well defined (the sum involves only a finite number of non-vanishing contributions) and is smooth. Therefore setting

$$
  f_j \;\coloneqq\; \frac{h_j}{h}
$$

then 

$$
 \left\{
    f_j
 \right\}_{j \in J}
$$

is a subordinate partition of unity by smooth functions as required.

### From a partition of unity to a locally finite partition of unity

+-- {: .num_defn #LocallyFinite}
###### Definition

A collection of functions $\mathcal{U} = \{u_i : X \to [0,1]\}$ such that every $x\in X$ is in the support of some $u_i$. Then $\mathcal{U}$ is called _locally finite_ if the cover $u_i^{-1}(0,1]$ (i.e. the induced cover) is [[locally finite cover|locally finite]].
=--

+-- {: .num_prop #MatherTheorem}
###### Proposition
([Mather, 1965](#Mather65))

Let $\{u_i\}_J$ be a partition of unity. Then there is a locally finite partition of unity $\{v_i\}_{i\in J}$ such that the induced cover of the latter is a refinement of the induced cover of the former.

=--

The **proof** is Proposition A.2.8 in [Dold 95](#Dold95) and Lemma 5.1.8 on page 301 of [Engelking 89](#Engelking89).

This implies that (locally finite) [[numerable covers]] are cofinal in induced covers arising from collections of functions as in the definition. In particular, given the [[Milnor classifying space]] $\mathcal{B}^M G$ of a [[topological group]] $G$, which comes with a countable family of 'coordinate functions' $\mathcal{B}^M G \to [0,1]$, has a numerable cover. This is shown by Dold to be a trivialising cover for the universal bundle constructed by Milnor, and so the universal bundle is [[numerable bundle|numerable]].


## Applications 

### Maps to geometric realizations

Partitions of unity can be used in constructing maps from spaces to [[geometric realization]]s of [[simplicial spaces]] (incl. simplicial sets) - for example a [[classifying map]] for a $G$-[[bundle]] where $G$ is a [[Lie group]].


### Coboundaries for Cech cocycles {#CechCoboundaries}

Partitions of unity can be used to give explicit coboundaries for the cocycles of the complex of functions on a cover.

Let $\{U_i \to X\}$ be a [[open cover]] and $\{\rho_i \in C(X,\mathbb{R})\}$ a collection of functions with

* $(x \notin U_i) \Rightarrow \rho_i(x) = 0$

* $\sum_i \rho_i = const_1$.

Write $C(\{U_i\}) : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ for the [[Cech nerve]] of the cover and $C(C(\{U_i\}), \mathbb{R})$ for the [[cosimplicial ring]] of functions on this [[simplicial object|simplicial]] topological space; and $(C_\bullet(C(\{U_i\}), \mathbb{R}), \delta)$ for the corresponding (normalized) [[Moore complex|cochain complex]]: its differential is the alternating sum of the pullbacks of functions along the face maps, i.e. along the restriction maps

$$
  \delta = \sum_k (-1)^k \delta_{k}^*
  \,.
$$

For instance for $f = \{f_{i_1, i_2, \cdots, i_n} \in C(U_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_{n+1}})\}$ a collection of functions in degree $n$, we have

$$
  (\delta f)_{i_0 \cdots i_n i_{n+1}} =
  \sum_{k = 0}^{n+1} (-1)^k f_{i_0 \cdots i_{k-1} i_{k+1} \cdots i_{n+1}}
  \,.
$$ 

This cochain complex has vanishing [[cochain cohomology]] in positive degree. We can explicitly construct corresponding coboundaries using the partion of unity:

assume that with the above notation $f$ is a cocycle in positive degree, in that $\delta f  = 0$. Then define the $(n-1)$-cochain

$$
  \lambda_{i_1 \cdots i_n}
  :=
  \sum_{i_0} \rho_{i_0} f_{i_0 i_1 \cdots i_n}
  \,.
$$

Here in the summands on the right the product is defined on $U_{i_0} \cap U_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_n}$ and extended as 0 to all of $U_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_n}$.

With this definition we have

$$
  \delta \lambda = f
  \,.
$$

To see this we compute

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (\delta \lambda)_{i_1 \cdots i_{n+1}}
    & :=
    \sum_{i_0} \rho_{i_0} \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^k f_{i_0 i_1 \cdots i_{k-1} i_{k+1} \cdots i_{n+1}}
    \\
    & =
    \pm 
    \sum_{i_0} \rho_{i_0} 
    f_{i_1 \cdots i_{n+1}}
    \\
    & = f_{i_1 \cdots i_{n+1}}
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where in the second step we used the condition $\delta f = 0$ and in the last step we used the property of the partition of unity.

This construction is used a lot in [[Cech cohomology]]. For instance it can be used to show in Chech cocycles that every [[principal bundle]] admits a [[connection on a bundle]] (see there for the details).

## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[functional analysis]], the concept of _distributional density_, usually just called _distribution_ for short, is a generalization of the concept of [[density]], hence of something that may be [[integration|integrated]] against a [[bump function]] to produce a [[number]]. If a non-degenerate background [[density]]/[[volume form]] $dvol$ is fixed, then each other density is a [[function]] relative to $dvol$, and hence with such an identification understood distributional densities are _[[generalized functions]]_, namely objects that may arise as potentially singular [[limit of a sequence|limits]] of [[sequences]] of [[smooth functions]] (i.e. of [[non-singular distributions]]).  Famous examples of such are the [[delta distributions]] and the [[Heaviside distribution]] which behave like constant functions with an infinitely sharp spike or kink, respectively.

Distributional densities appear notably as [[fundamental solutions]] to linear [[partial differential equations]] (such as for the [[wave equation]]/[[Klein-Gordon equation]], whose fundamental solutions are the [[propagators]] of [[free fields|free quantum fields]]), which is the context in which the concept was originally introduced. The study of their singularity structure (encoded by their [[singular support]] and their [[wave front set]]) is a fundamental tool in [[PDE theory]] (for instance in the [[propagation of singularities theorem]]), known as _[[microlocal analysis]]_. Distributions are also fundamental in the rigorous construction of [[perturbative quantum field theory]], where they appear in the variant as [[operator-valued distributions]].


Often distributions are considered by default just on [[open subsets]] of [[Euclidean space]] with its canonical [[volume form]] tacitly understood. But the concept of distributions makes sense more generally on general [[smooth manifolds]] (at least). If these are equipped with the structure of a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]]) [[Riemannian manifold]] then the induced [[volume form]] again identifies distributions with generalized functions. 

More in detail, given an actual [[density]]/[[volume form]] $dvol$ on some [[smooth manifold]] $X$, then the operation of [[integration]] of [[bump functions]] (elements in the [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$) against $dvol$ yields the [[continuous linear functional]]

$$
  \array{
    C^\infty_c(X)
      &\longrightarrow&
    \mathbb{R}
    \\
    b &\mapsto& \int_{x \in X} b(x) dvol(x)
  }
  \,.
$$

However, not every [[continuous linear functional]] on $C^\infty_c(X)$ arises this way. For example for $x_0 \in X$ any point, the simple [[evaluation]] map

$$
  \delta_{x_0}
  \;\colon\;
  b
  \mapsto
  b(x_0)
$$

is also a continuous linear functional on $C^\infty_c(X)$ (the "[[delta distribution]]"). While this is not the integral against any [[bump function]] times a fixed density, it is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of integrations against any [[sequence]] of bump functions (times the fixed density) whose [[support]] narrows in on $x_0$. Therefore one defines a distributional density simply to be _any_ [[continuous linear functional]] on $C^\infty_c(X)$. 

Various immediate variants of this definition may be considered. For instance if the space of "test functions" $C^\infty_c(X)$ is generalized to that of all [[smooth functions]], then one speaks of _[[compactly supported distributions]]_, or if it is enlarged just to the [[Schwartz space]] of functions with all [[derivatives]] rapidly decreasing, then one speaks of [[tempered distributions]]. These are important as on them there is a a good concept of [[Fourier transform of distributions]]. 

Most of the usual constructions of [[differential calculus]] generalize from [[smooth functions]] to distributions, notably there is a concept of [[derivative of distributions]] (defined by generalizing the formula for [[integration by parts]]). A key subtlety is that, however, some standard operations on functions become only [[partial function|partially defined]] on distributions, namely only when their singularity structure is compatible. In particular there is a concept of [[pullback of distributions]] and the [[product of distributions]] compatible with that of smooth functions, but defined only whenever the [[wave front sets]] of the distributions involved satisfy suitable compatibility conditions. Taking this subtlety into account for the [[operator-valued distributions]] appearing in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is what leads to the concept of [[Wick algebras]] ("normal ordering"), see there for more.

Due to their potentially singular nature, there is more freedom in the [[extension of distributions]] than there is for smooth functions. Notably for extensions from the complement of a single point to that point the freedom is in choosing a [[point-supported distribution]], and these are precisely the [[derivative of a distribution|derivatives]] of [[delta-distributions]]. In the construction of [[time-ordered products]] of [[operator-valued distributions]] it is precisely this freedom in choosing point-[[extensions of distributions]] which in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is known as "[[renormalization]]".

We first recall the

### As continuous linear functionals
 {#TraditionalDefinition}

Distributions come in various flavors, depending on what spaces of functions they act on. The functions they act on are called **test functions**; typically they are smooth functions on domains in Euclidean space satisfying some boundedness property. 

The widest (and generally the default) notion is as follows. 


+-- {: .num_defn #CompactlySupportedTestFunctions}
###### Definition
**(compactly supported test functions)**

For $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[smooth manifold]] given as an [[open subset]] of a [[Euclidean space]], the [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$ of _compactly supported test functions_ is the following

1. the underlying set is the set of [[bump functions]], hence of [[smooth functions]] $X \to \mathbb{R}$ to the [[real numbers]] with [[compact support]];

1. equipped with evident [[real vector space]] structure given by pointwise addition and pointwise multipication of functions.

1. equipped with the [[topological space|topology]] which is the [[metric topology]] induced from the family of [[seminorms]]

   $$\rho_{K, \alpha}(f) = \sup_{x \in K} |\partial^{\alpha} f|$$ 

   where $K \subseteq U$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] and $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n)$ is a multi-index and 

   $$\partial^{\alpha} = \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{\partial x^{\alpha_1}} \ldots \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{\partial x^{\alpha_n}}$$ 

   is the corresponding [[differential operator]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$ of compactly supported test functions (def. \ref{CompactlySupportedTestFunctions}) is [[locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]] and [[complete space|complete]] with respect to its [[uniformity]]; it is in fact an LF-space: an [[inductive limit]] of [[Fréchet spaces]] $C_c^{\infty}(K)$ (each of which has [[empty set|empty]] [[interior]] as a [[subspace]] of $C_c^{\infty}(U)$, so by the [[Baire category theorem]], $C_c^{\infty}(U)$ is not itself a [[Fréchet space]]).

###### Definition
**(distribution on Euclidean space)**

Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a [[smooth manifold]] given as an [[open subset]] of [[Euclidean space]].

A **distribution on** $X$ is a [[continuous linear functional]] of the form

$$C^\infty_c(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ 

from the [[locally convex space|locally convex]] [[topological vector space]] of compactly supported test functions (def. \ref{CompactlySupportedTestFunctions}) to the [[real numbers]].

The space of distributions on $X$ is denoted $\mathcal{D}'(X)$ (see also remark \ref{NotationForSpaceOfDistributions}). There is an obvious bilinear pairing 

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{D}'(X) \times C_c^{\infty}(X) &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    (S, \phi) &\mapsto& S(\phi)
  }
$$ 

given by [[evaluation]]. 

Often one writes $\langle S, \phi\rangle$ instead of $S(\phi)$. The space of distributions can be given the weak $*$-topology, meaning the smallest topology rendering the maps 

$$\langle -, \phi\rangle \;\colon\; \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathbb{R}$$ 

continuous for all test functions $\phi$.  As $C_c^\infty(U)$ is reflexive, this agrees with the weak topology.  

=--

See at _[[locally convex topological vector space]]_ the section _[Continuous linear functionals](locally+convex+space#ContinuousLinearFunctionals)_ for alternative characterizations of the continuity of distributions according to def. \ref{DistributionOnOpenSubsetOfEuclideanSpace}.

Notice that other natural topologies exist, such as [[uniform convergence]] on compact subsets of $C_c^\infty(U)$ (in this case, this agrees with uniform convergence on bounded subsets which usually goes by the name of the *strong* topology).


+-- {: .num_remark #NotationForSpaceOfDistributions}
###### Remark
**(notation)**

On general grounds the symbols $D(X)$ or $\mathcal{D}(X)$ or similar would seem evident notation for the space of distributions on a smooth manifold $X$. However, [[Laurent Schwartz]] in his seminal work ([Schwartz 50](#Schwartz50)) used $\mathcal{D}(X)$ to denote the space $C^\infty_c(X)$ of compactly supported continuous functions, and then $\mathcal{D}'(X)$ for its linear continuous dual, hence for the space of distributions (see also [H&#246;r#mander 90, below def. 2.1.1](#Hoermander90)). 

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

If $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ is [[locally integrable function|locally integrable]], then for all test functions $\phi$ the [[Lebesgue integral]] 

$$\langle f, \phi\rangle = \int_X f(x)\phi(x) d x $$ 

is defined; in this way a function $f$ locally integrable over $X$ may be regarded as a distribution on $X$ (explaining both the sense in which distributions are "generalized functions" and a reason for the angle-bracket notation for the evaluation pairing). In particular, there is an obvious inclusion 

$$C_c^{\infty}(X) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{D}'(X)$$ 

and this inclusion turns out to be [[dense subset|dense]]. 

=--

Other notions of spaces of distributions, each endowed with the weak $*$-topology, include 

* [[compactly supported distributions]] on $U$. These are functionals on $C^{\infty}(U)$ (test functions without compact support). 

* [[tempered distributions]] (usually on $U = \mathbb{R}^n$). These are functionals on what is called the _[[Schwartz space]]_ $\mathcal{S}$: the space of smooth functions each of whose [[derivatives]] (of any order) decays rapidly (goes to zero more quickly than any negative power of $|x|$ as $|x| \to \infty$). The topology on Schwartz space is induced by the family of seminorms 
$$\rho_{K, \alpha, \beta}(\phi) = \sup_{x \in K} |x^\alpha \partial^\beta \phi|$$ 
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ are multi-indices. 

* Rapidly decaying distributions (usually on $U = \mathbb{R}^n$). These are functionals on the space of smooth functions each of whose partial derivatives (of any order) has "tempered" or moderate growth (i.e., bounded by polynomial growth). 


+-- {: .num_prop #PullbackOfDistributionAlongSubmersion}
###### Proposition
**([[pullback of distributions]] along [[submersions]])**

If $X_1, X_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are two [[open subsets]] of [[Euclidean space]], and if

$$
  f \;\colon\; X_1 \overset{}{\longrightarrow} X_2
$$

is a [[submersion]] (i.e. its [[differential]] is a [[surjective function]] $d f_x \;\colon\; T_x X_1 \to T_{f(x)} X_2$ for all $x \in X_1$), then there is a unique [[continuous linear functional]]

$$
  f^\ast \;\colon\; \mathcal{D}'(X_2) \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}'(X_1)
$$

between spaces of distributions (def. \ref{DistributionOnOpenSubsetOfEuclideanSpace}) which extends the [[pullback of functions]] in that on a distribution represented by a [[bump function]] $b$ it is given by precomposition

$$
  f^\ast b = b \circ f
  \,.
$$

This is hence called the _[[pullback of distributions]]_.

### As smooth linear functionals
 {#CharacterizationByMonads}

Since [[smooth functions]] on [[smooth manifolds]] are the subject of [[differential geometry]], and since spaces of [[smooth functions]] are naturally themselves [[generalized smooth spaces]], it makes sense to ask whether distribution theory is actually a native topic to [[differential geometry]].

In particular we may ask how distributions in the [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] sense relate to the _smooth linear functions_ on smooth spaces of smooth functions. Indeed, with respect to the natural formulation of differential geometry via [[functorial geometry]] ([[topos theory]]) in terms of [[diffeological spaces]], [[smooth sets]] etc. it turns out that distributional densities are equivalently the smooth linear functionals on smooth spaces of smooth functions.

This is discussed at 

* _[[distributions are the smooth linear functionals]]_.

## Operations on distributions 

### Inducing operations by dual extension

As $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ is dual to $C_c^\infty(U)$, each continuous linear operator on $C_c^\infty(U)$ induces a corresponding linear operator on $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ in the obvious way.  Given

$$
F\colon C_c^\infty(U) \to C_c^\infty(U)
$$

we define

$$
F^*\colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)
$$

according to the usual formula for dualities

$$
F^* S(\phi) = S(F \phi).
$$

However, since there is an obvious inclusion $C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ induced by the standard inner product on $C_c^\infty(U)$, what is more usually desired is not this dual operator but an **extension** operator.  That is, instead of $F^*$ we want an operator $F^\dagger \colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ with the property that for $\phi \in C_c^\infty(U)$ then $F^\dagger(\phi) = F(\phi)$ (identifying $C_c^\infty(U)$ with its image in $\mathcal{D}'(U)$).  Being slightly more careful, let us write $\iota \colon C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ for the inclusion induced by the inner product.  Then we want $F^\dagger(\iota \phi) = \iota (F(\phi))$.

If the extension exists, we have

$$
F^\dagger(\iota \phi)(\psi) = \iota(F(\phi))(\psi) = \langle F(\phi), \psi \rangle
$$

Now suppose that $F$ has an adjoint, say $F^+$, with respect to the inner product.  Note that this is not automatic since $C_c^\infty(U)$ is not a Hilbert space.  Moreover, even if $F$ extends to the Hilbert completion the Hilbertian adjoint may not work since it may not define a continuous linear map on the subspace $C_c^\infty(U)$.  But if $F^+$ does exist then we have

$$
F^\dagger(\iota \phi)(\psi) = \langle F(\phi), \psi \rangle = \langle \phi, F^+(\psi) \rangle
$$

In this case, the definition of $F^\dagger$ on the whole of $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ is obvious: simply take ${F^+}^*$.  That is, the dual operator to the adjoint to $F$.  In full, $F^\dagger \colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ is defined via the formula

$$
\langle F^\dagger(S),\phi\rangle = \langle S, F^+(\phi) \rangle
$$

If the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$ then this carries through essentially unchanged except for the fact that one does **not** use the inner product on $C_c^\infty(U)$ but rather the associated bilinear pairing

$$
(\phi,\psi) = \int_U \phi \psi
$$

This is to ensure that the inclusion $C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ is complex linear and not conjugate linear.  Otherwise extending operators becomes complex.

Two instances are of particular importance: 

* Multiplication by a smooth function $\theta$. If $\theta$ is any smooth function on $U$ (not necessarily compactly supported), then we can define $\theta \cdot S$ by observing that this multiplication is self-adjoint: 
$$\langle \theta \cdot \phi, \psi \rangle = \langle \phi, \psi \cdot \theta\rangle$$
where $\phi, \psi$ are arbitrary test functions.  Thus we define $\theta \cdot S$ by
$$\langle \theta \cdot S, \psi \rangle = \langle S, \theta \cdot \psi$$

* Differentiation. If $\partial^i$ is partial differentiation with respect to the $i^{th}$ coordinate, then for test functions $\psi$, $\phi$ we have 
$$\int_U \partial^i(\psi)(x) \phi(x)\; d x = -\int_U \psi(x) \partial^i(\phi)(x)\; d x$$ 
by simple integration by parts and the fact that $\phi$, $\psi$ are compactly supported.  Thus differentiation is _skew_-adjoint and so we define the extension to distributions by 
$$\langle \partial^i(S), \phi\rangle = -\langle S, \partial^i(\phi) \rangle$$ 
for all test functions $\phi$. In general, 
$$\langle \partial^\alpha S, \phi\rangle = (-1)^{|\alpha|}\langle S, \partial^\alpha \phi \rangle$$
where $|\alpha| = \alpha_1 + \ldots + \alpha_n$ is the total degree of the multi-index. 

Thus derivatives of distributions are defined to all orders. Some examples are given in the section "examples".

As explained above, any locally integrable function on $U$ defines a distribution on $U$. Other examples may be produced fairly cheaply by restriction of functionals on various TVS which contain the test functions. 

For instance: if $C_c(U)$ denotes the space of real-valued continuous functions with compact support in $U$ (topologized by uniform convergence on compacts), then a functional $\mu: C_c(U) \to \mathbb{R}$ is essentially the same as a signed measure on $U$ (Riesz-Markov theorem), i.e., there is a unique signed measure $d m$ for which 

$$\mu(\phi) = \int_U \phi d m.$$ 

Since the inclusion $i: C_c^\infty(U) \hookrightarrow C_c(U)$ is continuous, it follows that a measure $\mu$ defines a distribution by simple restriction along $i$: 

$$C_c^\infty(U) \overset{i}{\to} C_c(U) \overset{\mu}{\to} \mathbb{R}$$ 

Specializing further, consider any function of bounded variation on $U = \mathbb{R}$, say a bounded monotone increasing function $\alpha$. Then the Riemann-Stieltjes integral 

$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) d\alpha(x)$$ 

is defined for all functions $f$ with compact support; this provides a measure $d\alpha$ and hence a distribution. 

A prototypical example of this is provided by the Heaviside function: $H(x) = 1$ if $x \gt 0$, else 0. ("Heaviside": what a great pun!) Here we have, for all $f \in C_c(\mathbb{R})$, 

$$\langle f, d H \rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) d H(x) = f(0)$$ 

As a distribution, the Heaviside measure is the famous **[[Dirac distribution]]**. The long-standing intuitive practice among physicists and engineers is to write 

$$d H(x) = \delta_0(x) d x$$ 

where of course the function $H(x)$ doesn't have a derivative in the classical sense (i.e., as a function), but as a distribution, it does. Meanwhile, $H(x)$ is itself the derivative of a continuous function: $G(x) = \max\{x, 0\}$. 

For an example of a distribution on $\mathbb{R}$ which does not arise from a measure, consider the derivative of the Dirac distribution. (As a functional, it maps a test function $\phi$ to $-\phi'(0)$.) 

These examples are by no means curiosities. A fairly deep theorem is that _every_ distribution arises as a linear combination of derivatives of continuous functions:  

**Theorem:** Let $S$ be a distribution on an open domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Then, there exist a finite collection $A$ of multi-indices $\alpha$ and continuous functions $g_\alpha$ defined on $U$ for which 

$$S = \sum_{\alpha \in A} \partial^\alpha g_\alpha$$ 

## Applications 

The theory of distributions (and more generally of [[microlocal analysis]]) is central in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] in its rigorous incarnation via [[causal perturbation theory]]/[[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]].

For example the reason for [[normal ordered products]] in [[Wick algebras]] is given by the H&#246;rmander criterion on [[wave front sets]] for the [[product of distributions]] to be well defind, and [[renormalization]] is understood to be the freedom in choosing [[extension of distributions]] of the resulting products of [[Feynman propagators]]. 

See also _[[operator-valued distribution]]_ and _[[Wightman axioms]]_. 

A brief survey of applications of distribution theory to perturbative quantum field theory may be found [here](http://www1.jinr.ru/Archive/Pepan/v-31-7a/I_ktp_04_t.pdf). 
  

Within mathematics, distributions are quite commonplace; for example, de Rham appropriated them for his theory of [[currents]]. Distribution theory has also long been used in the theory of partial differential equations. Here is a sample theorem: 

* **Theorem (Ehrenpreis, Malgrange):** Let $D$ be a linear differential operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with constant coefficients. Given a compactly supported smooth function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a smooth solution $u$ to the equation $D u = f$. 

A proof is given in these [notes](http://www-math.mit.edu/~helgason/hormander.pdf) by Helgason. The basic idea is to prove there exists a **fundamental solution** of $D$, i.e., a distribution $T$ such that $D T = \delta_0$. Then $u = f * T$ is smooth. The existence of a fundamental solution involves a theorem of Paley-Wiener type. 

## Variants

### In synthetic differential geometry 

There is another point of view on distributions: that they _can_ be modeled by actual functions provided that one admits infinite and infinitesimal quantities of the type used in Robinson [[nonstandard analysis]]. One particular approach is to formulate axiomatically the theory of distributions so that it can be interpreted in [[smooth toposes]] that model the axioms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] and support a suitable notion of invertible [[infinitesimal object]]s and infinitely large integers.

This is discussed in ([Moerdijk-Reyes 91](#MoerdijkReyes91)).

which closely mirrors the original treatment in Robinson's book Non-standard Analysis. Examples of models that support these axioms are the toposes $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ described there. 

### Currents

In $\mathbb{R}^n$ the distributions and generalized functions boil down to the same thing, so the terminology identifies them. But on a manifold, the distributions/generalized densities (functionals on test functions) and generalized functions (functionals on test *densities*) do not agree. See V. Guillemin, S. Sternberg: _Geometric asymptotics_ ([free online](http://www.ams.org/online_bks/surv14)). While generalized functions pull back, distributions/generalized densities push forward (under some conditions, though). 

More generally one can study generalized differential $k$-forms in local coordinates they look like $\sum f_\alpha dx^{\alpha_1}\wedge \cdot \wedge dx^{\alpha_k}$. Usually they are called **currents**. They are useful e.g. in the study of higher dimensional residua in higher dimensional complex geometry (cf. *Principles of algebraic geometry* by Griffiths and Harris) and in geometric measure theory (cf. the monograph by Federer).  

### Hyperfunctions and Coulombeau distributions

Sometimes one considers larger spaces of distributions, where worse singularities than in Schwarz theory are allowed. Most well known are the theory of _[[hyperfunctions]]_ and the theory of **Coulombeau distributions**. 

### Distributions from nonstandard analysis

Distributions can be alternatively described using [[nonstandard analysis]], see there.

Generalized functions were introduced by S. L. Sobolev in 1935, and independently (under the name _distributions_) by [[Laurent Schwartz]] in the 1940's, who unaware of Sobolev's work developed an extensive theory for them.

## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[functional analysis]], the concept of _distributional density_, usually just called _distribution_ for short, is a generalization of the concept of [[density]], hence of something that may be [[integration|integrated]] against a [[bump function]] to produce a [[number]]. If a non-degenerate background [[density]]/[[volume form]] $dvol$ is fixed, then each other density is a [[function]] relative to $dvol$, and hence with such an identification understood distributional densities are _[[generalized functions]]_, namely objects that may arise as potentially singular [[limit of a sequence|limits]] of [[sequences]] of [[smooth functions]] (i.e. of [[non-singular distributions]]).  Famous examples of such are the [[delta distributions]] and the [[Heaviside distribution]] which behave like constant functions with an infinitely sharp spike or kink, respectively.

Distributional densities appear notably as [[fundamental solutions]] to linear [[partial differential equations]] (such as for the [[wave equation]]/[[Klein-Gordon equation]], whose fundamental solutions are the [[propagators]] of [[free fields|free quantum fields]]), which is the context in which the concept was originally introduced. The study of their singularity structure (encoded by their [[singular support]] and their [[wave front set]]) is a fundamental tool in [[PDE theory]] (for instance in the [[propagation of singularities theorem]]), known as _[[microlocal analysis]]_. Distributions are also fundamental in the rigorous construction of [[perturbative quantum field theory]], where they appear in the variant as [[operator-valued distributions]].


Often distributions are considered by default just on [[open subsets]] of [[Euclidean space]] with its canonical [[volume form]] tacitly understood. But the concept of distributions makes sense more generally on general [[smooth manifolds]] (at least). If these are equipped with the structure of a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]]) [[Riemannian manifold]] then the induced [[volume form]] again identifies distributions with generalized functions. 

More in detail, given an actual [[density]]/[[volume form]] $dvol$ on some [[smooth manifold]] $X$, then the operation of [[integration]] of [[bump functions]] (elements in the [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$) against $dvol$ yields the [[continuous linear functional]]

$$
  \array{
    C^\infty_c(X)
      &\longrightarrow&
    \mathbb{R}
    \\
    b &\mapsto& \int_{x \in X} b(x) dvol(x)
  }
  \,.
$$

However, not every [[continuous linear functional]] on $C^\infty_c(X)$ arises this way. For example for $x_0 \in X$ any point, the simple [[evaluation]] map

$$
  \delta_{x_0}
  \;\colon\;
  b
  \mapsto
  b(x_0)
$$

is also a continuous linear functional on $C^\infty_c(X)$ (the "[[delta distribution]]"). While this is not the integral against any [[bump function]] times a fixed density, it is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of integrations against any [[sequence]] of bump functions (times the fixed density) whose [[support]] narrows in on $x_0$. Therefore one defines a distributional density simply to be _any_ [[continuous linear functional]] on $C^\infty_c(X)$. 

Various immediate variants of this definition may be considered. For instance if the space of "test functions" $C^\infty_c(X)$ is generalized to that of all [[smooth functions]], then one speaks of _[[compactly supported distributions]]_, or if it is enlarged just to the [[Schwartz space]] of functions with all [[derivatives]] rapidly decreasing, then one speaks of [[tempered distributions]]. These are important as on them there is a a good concept of [[Fourier transform of distributions]]. 

Most of the usual constructions of [[differential calculus]] generalize from [[smooth functions]] to distributions, notably there is a concept of [[derivative of distributions]] (defined by generalizing the formula for [[integration by parts]]). A key subtlety is that, however, some standard operations on functions become only [[partial function|partially defined]] on distributions, namely only when their singularity structure is compatible. In particular there is a concept of [[pullback of distributions]] and the [[product of distributions]] compatible with that of smooth functions, but defined only whenever the [[wave front sets]] of the distributions involved satisfy suitable compatibility conditions. Taking this subtlety into account for the [[operator-valued distributions]] appearing in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is what leads to the concept of [[Wick algebras]] ("normal ordering"), see there for more.

Due to their potentially singular nature, there is more freedom in the [[extension of distributions]] than there is for smooth functions. Notably for extensions from the complement of a single point to that point the freedom is in choosing a [[point-supported distribution]], and these are precisely the [[derivative of a distribution|derivatives]] of [[delta-distributions]]. In the construction of [[time-ordered products]] of [[operator-valued distributions]] it is precisely this freedom in choosing point-[[extensions of distributions]] which in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is known as "[[renormalization]]".

Then we consider the axiomatic reformulation in terms of [[monads]] following [Kock 11](#Kock11).

### As continuous linear functionals
 {#TraditionalDefinition}

Distributions come in various flavors, depending on what spaces of functions they act on. The functions they act on are called **test functions**; typically they are smooth functions on domains in Euclidean space satisfying some boundedness property. 

The widest (and generally the default) notion is as follows. 


+-- {: .num_defn #CompactlySupportedTestFunctions}
###### Definition
**(compactly supported test functions)**

For $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[smooth manifold]] given as an [[open subset]] of a [[Euclidean space]], the [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$ of _compactly supported test functions_ is the following

1. the underlying set is the set of [[bump functions]], hence of [[smooth functions]] $X \to \mathbb{R}$ to the [[real numbers]] with [[compact support]];

1. equipped with evident [[real vector space]] structure given by pointwise addition and pointwise multipication of functions.

1. equipped with the [[topological space|topology]] which is the [[metric topology]] induced from the family of [[seminorms]]

   $$\rho_{K, \alpha}(f) = \sup_{x \in K} |\partial^{\alpha} f|$$ 

   where $K \subseteq U$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] and $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n)$ is a multi-index and 

   $$\partial^{\alpha} = \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{\partial x^{\alpha_1}} \ldots \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{\partial x^{\alpha_n}}$$ 

   is the corresponding [[differential operator]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$ of compactly supported test functions (def. \ref{CompactlySupportedTestFunctions}) is [[locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]] and [[complete space|complete]] with respect to its [[uniformity]]; it is in fact an LF-space: an [[inductive limit]] of [[Fréchet spaces]] $C_c^{\infty}(K)$ (each of which has [[empty set|empty]] [[interior]] as a [[subspace]] of $C_c^{\infty}(U)$, so by the [[Baire category theorem]], $C_c^{\infty}(U)$ is not itself a [[Fréchet space]]).

+-- {: .num_defn #DistributionOnOpenSubsetOfEuclideanSpace}
###### Definition
**(distribution on Euclidean space)**

Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a [[smooth manifold]] given as an [[open subset]] of [[Euclidean space]].

A **distribution on** $X$ is a [[continuous linear functional]] of the form

$$C^\infty_c(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ 

from the [[locally convex space|locally convex]] [[topological vector space]] of compactly supported test functions (def. \ref{CompactlySupportedTestFunctions}) to the [[real numbers]].

The space of distributions on $X$ is denoted $\mathcal{D}'(X)$ (see also remark \ref{NotationForSpaceOfDistributions}). There is an obvious bilinear pairing 

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{D}'(X) \times C_c^{\infty}(X) &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    (S, \phi) &\mapsto& S(\phi)
  }
$$ 

given by [[evaluation]]. 

Often one writes $\langle S, \phi\rangle$ instead of $S(\phi)$. The space of distributions can be given the weak $*$-topology, meaning the smallest topology rendering the maps 

$$\langle -, \phi\rangle \;\colon\; \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathbb{R}$$ 

continuous for all test functions $\phi$.  As $C_c^\infty(U)$ is reflexive, this agrees with the weak topology.  

=--

See at _[[locally convex topological vector space]]_ the section _[Continuous linear functionals](locally+convex+space#ContinuousLinearFunctionals)_ for alternative characterizations of the continuity of distributions according to def. \ref{DistributionOnOpenSubsetOfEuclideanSpace}.

Notice that other natural topologies exist, such as [[uniform convergence]] on compact subsets of $C_c^\infty(U)$ (in this case, this agrees with uniform convergence on bounded subsets which usually goes by the name of the *strong* topology).


+-- {: .num_remark #NotationForSpaceOfDistributions}
###### Remark
**(notation)**

On general grounds the symbols $D(X)$ or $\mathcal{D}(X)$ or similar would seem evident notation for the space of distributions on a smooth manifold $X$. However, [[Laurent Schwartz]] in his seminal work ([Schwartz 50](#Schwartz50)) used $\mathcal{D}(X)$ to denote the space $C^\infty_c(X)$ of compactly supported continuous functions, and then $\mathcal{D}'(X)$ for its linear continuous dual, hence for the space of distributions (see also [H&#246;r#mander 90, below def. 2.1.1](#Hoermander90)). 

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

If $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ is [[locally integrable function|locally integrable]], then for all test functions $\phi$ the [[Lebesgue integral]] 

$$\langle f, \phi\rangle = \int_X f(x)\phi(x) d x $$ 

is defined; in this way a function $f$ locally integrable over $X$ may be regarded as a distribution on $X$ (explaining both the sense in which distributions are "generalized functions" and a reason for the angle-bracket notation for the evaluation pairing). In particular, there is an obvious inclusion 

$$C_c^{\infty}(X) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{D}'(X)$$ 

and this inclusion turns out to be [[dense subset|dense]]. 

=--

Other notions of spaces of distributions, each endowed with the weak $*$-topology, include 

* [[compactly supported distributions]] on $U$. These are functionals on $C^{\infty}(U)$ (test functions without compact support). 

* [[tempered distributions]] (usually on $U = \mathbb{R}^n$). These are functionals on what is called the _[[Schwartz space]]_ $\mathcal{S}$: the space of smooth functions each of whose [[derivatives]] (of any order) decays rapidly (goes to zero more quickly than any negative power of $|x|$ as $|x| \to \infty$). The topology on Schwartz space is induced by the family of seminorms 
$$\rho_{K, \alpha, \beta}(\phi) = \sup_{x \in K} |x^\alpha \partial^\beta \phi|$$ 
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ are multi-indices. 

* Rapidly decaying distributions (usually on $U = \mathbb{R}^n$). These are functionals on the space of smooth functions each of whose partial derivatives (of any order) has "tempered" or moderate growth (i.e., bounded by polynomial growth). 


+-- {: .num_prop #PullbackOfDistributionAlongSubmersion}
###### Proposition
**([[pullback of distributions]] along [[submersions]])**

If $X_1, X_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are two [[open subsets]] of [[Euclidean space]], and if

$$
  f \;\colon\; X_1 \overset{}{\longrightarrow} X_2
$$

is a [[submersion]] (i.e. its [[differential]] is a [[surjective function]] $d f_x \;\colon\; T_x X_1 \to T_{f(x)} X_2$ for all $x \in X_1$), then there is a unique [[continuous linear functional]]

$$
  f^\ast \;\colon\; \mathcal{D}'(X_2) \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}'(X_1)
$$

between spaces of distributions (def. \ref{DistributionOnOpenSubsetOfEuclideanSpace}) which extends the [[pullback of functions]] in that on a distribution represented by a [[bump function]] $b$ it is given by precomposition

$$
  f^\ast b = b \circ f
  \,.
$$

This is hence called the _[[pullback of distributions]]_.

### As smooth linear functionals
 {#CharacterizationByMonads}

Since [[smooth functions]] on [[smooth manifolds]] are the subject of [[differential geometry]], and since spaces of [[smooth functions]] are naturally themselves [[generalized smooth spaces]], it makes sense to ask whether distribution theory is actually a native topic to [[differential geometry]].

In particular we may ask how distributions in the [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] sense relate to the _smooth linear functions_ on smooth spaces of smooth functions. Indeed, with respect to the natural formulation of differential geometry via [[functorial geometry]] ([[topos theory]]) in terms of [[diffeological spaces]], [[smooth sets]] etc. it turns out that distributional densities are equivalently the smooth linear functionals on smooth spaces of smooth functions.

This is discussed at 

* _[[distributions are the smooth linear functionals]]_.

## Operations on distributions 

### Inducing operations by dual extension

As $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ is dual to $C_c^\infty(U)$, each continuous linear operator on $C_c^\infty(U)$ induces a corresponding linear operator on $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ in the obvious way.  Given

$$
F\colon C_c^\infty(U) \to C_c^\infty(U)
$$

we define

$$
F^*\colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)
$$

according to the usual formula for dualities

$$
F^* S(\phi) = S(F \phi).
$$

However, since there is an obvious inclusion $C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ induced by the standard inner product on $C_c^\infty(U)$, what is more usually desired is not this dual operator but an **extension** operator.  That is, instead of $F^*$ we want an operator $F^\dagger \colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ with the property that for $\phi \in C_c^\infty(U)$ then $F^\dagger(\phi) = F(\phi)$ (identifying $C_c^\infty(U)$ with its image in $\mathcal{D}'(U)$).  Being slightly more careful, let us write $\iota \colon C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ for the inclusion induced by the inner product.  Then we want $F^\dagger(\iota \phi) = \iota (F(\phi))$.

If the extension exists, we have

$$
F^\dagger(\iota \phi)(\psi) = \iota(F(\phi))(\psi) = \langle F(\phi), \psi \rangle
$$

Now suppose that $F$ has an adjoint, say $F^+$, with respect to the inner product.  Note that this is not automatic since $C_c^\infty(U)$ is not a Hilbert space.  Moreover, even if $F$ extends to the Hilbert completion the Hilbertian adjoint may not work since it may not define a continuous linear map on the subspace $C_c^\infty(U)$.  But if $F^+$ does exist then we have

$$
F^\dagger(\iota \phi)(\psi) = \langle F(\phi), \psi \rangle = \langle \phi, F^+(\psi) \rangle
$$

In this case, the definition of $F^\dagger$ on the whole of $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ is obvious: simply take ${F^+}^*$.  That is, the dual operator to the adjoint to $F$.  In full, $F^\dagger \colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ is defined via the formula

$$
\langle F^\dagger(S),\phi\rangle = \langle S, F^+(\phi) \rangle
$$

If the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$ then this carries through essentially unchanged except for the fact that one does **not** use the inner product on $C_c^\infty(U)$ but rather the associated bilinear pairing

$$
(\phi,\psi) = \int_U \phi \psi
$$

This is to ensure that the inclusion $C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ is complex linear and not conjugate linear.  Otherwise extending operators becomes complex.

Two instances are of particular importance: 

* Multiplication by a smooth function $\theta$. If $\theta$ is any smooth function on $U$ (not necessarily compactly supported), then we can define $\theta \cdot S$ by observing that this multiplication is self-adjoint: 
$$\langle \theta \cdot \phi, \psi \rangle = \langle \phi, \psi \cdot \theta\rangle$$
where $\phi, \psi$ are arbitrary test functions.  Thus we define $\theta \cdot S$ by
$$\langle \theta \cdot S, \psi \rangle = \langle S, \theta \cdot \psi$$

* Differentiation. If $\partial^i$ is partial differentiation with respect to the $i^{th}$ coordinate, then for test functions $\psi$, $\phi$ we have 
$$\int_U \partial^i(\psi)(x) \phi(x)\; d x = -\int_U \psi(x) \partial^i(\phi)(x)\; d x$$ 
by simple integration by parts and the fact that $\phi$, $\psi$ are compactly supported.  Thus differentiation is _skew_-adjoint and so we define the extension to distributions by 
$$\langle \partial^i(S), \phi\rangle = -\langle S, \partial^i(\phi) \rangle$$ 
for all test functions $\phi$. In general, 
$$\langle \partial^\alpha S, \phi\rangle = (-1)^{|\alpha|}\langle S, \partial^\alpha \phi \rangle$$
where $|\alpha| = \alpha_1 + \ldots + \alpha_n$ is the total degree of the multi-index. 

Thus derivatives of distributions are defined to all orders. Some examples are given in the section "examples".

### Multiplication of Distributions
 {#MultiplicationsOfDistributions}

See at _[[multiplication of distributions]]_

## Examples 

As explained above, any locally integrable function on $U$ defines a distribution on $U$. Other examples may be produced fairly cheaply by restriction of functionals on various TVS which contain the test functions. 

For instance: if $C_c(U)$ denotes the space of real-valued continuous functions with compact support in $U$ (topologized by uniform convergence on compacts), then a functional $\mu: C_c(U) \to \mathbb{R}$ is essentially the same as a signed measure on $U$ (Riesz-Markov theorem), i.e., there is a unique signed measure $d m$ for which 

$$\mu(\phi) = \int_U \phi d m.$$ 

Since the inclusion $i: C_c^\infty(U) \hookrightarrow C_c(U)$ is continuous, it follows that a measure $\mu$ defines a distribution by simple restriction along $i$: 

$$C_c^\infty(U) \overset{i}{\to} C_c(U) \overset{\mu}{\to} \mathbb{R}$$ 

Specializing further, consider any function of bounded variation on $U = \mathbb{R}$, say a bounded monotone increasing function $\alpha$. Then the Riemann-Stieltjes integral 

$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) d\alpha(x)$$ 

is defined for all functions $f$ with compact support; this provides a measure $d\alpha$ and hence a distribution. 

A prototypical example of this is provided by the Heaviside function: $H(x) = 1$ if $x \gt 0$, else 0. ("Heaviside": what a great pun!) Here we have, for all $f \in C_c(\mathbb{R})$, 

$$\langle f, d H \rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) d H(x) = f(0)$$ 

As a distribution, the Heaviside measure is the famous **[[Dirac distribution]]**. The long-standing intuitive practice among physicists and engineers is to write 

$$d H(x) = \delta_0(x) d x$$ 

where of course the function $H(x)$ doesn't have a derivative in the classical sense (i.e., as a function), but as a distribution, it does. Meanwhile, $H(x)$ is itself the derivative of a continuous function: $G(x) = \max\{x, 0\}$. 

For an example of a distribution on $\mathbb{R}$ which does not arise from a measure, consider the derivative of the Dirac distribution. (As a functional, it maps a test function $\phi$ to $-\phi'(0)$.) 

These examples are by no means curiosities. A fairly deep theorem is that _every_ distribution arises as a linear combination of derivatives of continuous functions:  

**Theorem:** Let $S$ be a distribution on an open domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Then, there exist a finite collection $A$ of multi-indices $\alpha$ and continuous functions $g_\alpha$ defined on $U$ for which 

$$S = \sum_{\alpha \in A} \partial^\alpha g_\alpha$$ 

## Applications 

The theory of distributions (and more generally of [[microlocal analysis]]) is central in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] in its rigorous incarnation via [[causal perturbation theory]]/[[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]].

For example the reason for [[normal ordered products]] in [[Wick algebras]] is given by the H&#246;rmander criterion on [[wave front sets]] for the [[product of distributions]] to be well defind, and [[renormalization]] is understood to be the freedom in choosing [[extension of distributions]] of the resulting products of [[Feynman propagators]]. 

See also _[[operator-valued distribution]]_ and _[[Wightman axioms]]_. 

A brief survey of applications of distribution theory to perturbative quantum field theory may be found [here](http://www1.jinr.ru/Archive/Pepan/v-31-7a/I_ktp_04_t.pdf). 
  

Within mathematics, distributions are quite commonplace; for example, de Rham appropriated them for his theory of [[currents]]. Distribution theory has also long been used in the theory of partial differential equations. Here is a sample theorem: 

* **Theorem (Ehrenpreis, Malgrange):** Let $D$ be a linear differential operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with constant coefficients. Given a compactly supported smooth function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a smooth solution $u$ to the equation $D u = f$. 

A proof is given in these [notes](http://www-math.mit.edu/~helgason/hormander.pdf) by Helgason. The basic idea is to prove there exists a **fundamental solution** of $D$, i.e., a distribution $T$ such that $D T = \delta_0$. Then $u = f * T$ is smooth. The existence of a fundamental solution involves a theorem of Paley-Wiener type. 

## Variants

### In synthetic differential geometry 

There is another point of view on distributions: that they _can_ be modeled by actual functions provided that one admits infinite and infinitesimal quantities of the type used in Robinson [[nonstandard analysis]]. One particular approach is to formulate axiomatically the theory of distributions so that it can be interpreted in [[smooth toposes]] that model the axioms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] and support a suitable notion of invertible [[infinitesimal object]]s and infinitely large integers.

This is discussed in ([Moerdijk-Reyes 91](#MoerdijkReyes91)).

which closely mirrors the original treatment in Robinson's book Non-standard Analysis. Examples of models that support these axioms are the toposes $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ described there. 

### Currents

In $\mathbb{R}^n$ the distributions and generalized functions boil down to the same thing, so the terminology identifies them. But on a manifold, the distributions/generalized densities (functionals on test functions) and generalized functions (functionals on test *densities*) do not agree. See V. Guillemin, S. Sternberg: _Geometric asymptotics_ ([free online](http://www.ams.org/online_bks/surv14)). While generalized functions pull back, distributions/generalized densities push forward (under some conditions, though). 

More generally one can study generalized differential $k$-forms in local coordinates they look like $\sum f_\alpha dx^{\alpha_1}\wedge \cdot \wedge dx^{\alpha_k}$. Usually they are called **currents**. They are useful e.g. in the study of higher dimensional residua in higher dimensional complex geometry (cf. *Principles of algebraic geometry* by Griffiths and Harris) and in geometric measure theory (cf. the monograph by Federer).  

### Hyperfunctions and Coulombeau distributions

Sometimes one considers larger spaces of distributions, where worse singularities than in Schwarz theory are allowed. Most well known are the theory of _[[hyperfunctions]]_ and the theory of **Coulombeau distributions**. 

### Distributions from nonstandard analysis

Distributions can be alternatively described using [[nonstandard analysis]], see there.

Generalized functions were introduced by S. L. Sobolev in 1935, and independently (under the name _distributions_) by [[Laurent Schwartz]] in the 1940's, who unaware of Sobolev's work developed an extensive theory for them.

## Idea

A _probability distribution_ is a [[measure]] used in [[probability theory]] whose [[integral]] over some subspace of a [[measurable space]] is regarded as assigning a _probability_ for some event to take values in this subset.

Often a _[[probability density]]_.

## Definition

### On measurable spaces

A __probability distribution__ is a [[measure]] $\rho$ on a [[measurable space]] $X$ such that

* it is positive: $\forall U \subset X : \int_U d\rho \geq 0$;

* it is normalized: $\int_X d\rho = 1$.

### On $\sigma$-frames

In measure theory, a __probability measure__ or __probability distribution__ on a [[sigma-frame|$\sigma$-frame]] or more generally a [[sigma-complete lattice |$\sigma$-complete]] [[distributive lattice]] $(L, \leq, \bot, \vee, \top, \wedge, \Vee)$ is a [[probability valuation]] $\mu:L \to [0, 1]$ such that the elements are mutually disjoint and the probability valuation is denumerably/countably additive
$$\forall s\in L^\mathbb{N}. \forall m \in \mathbb{N}. \forall n \in \mathbb{N}. (m \neq n) \wedge (s(m) \wedge s(n) = \bot)$$
$$\forall s\in L^\mathbb{N}. \mu(\Vee_{n:\mathbb{N}} s(n)) = \sum_{n:\mathbb{N}} \mu(s(n))$$

## Properties

The collection of all probability distributions on a measurable space carries various [[metric]] structures that are studied in [[information geometry]]:

* [[information metric]]

* [[Wasserstein metric]]

## Examples

* [[Gaussian probability distribution]]

## Definition

### In set theory

Given a [[pointed set]] $A$ with specified [[element]] $0 \in A$, a [[set]] $X$, and a [[function]] $f \colon X \to A$, the _support_ of $f$ is the [[subset]] of $X$ on which $f$ is not equal to $0$.

#### In constructive mathematics

In [[constructive mathematics]], there are multiple notions of [[inequality]], due to the failure of the [[double negation law]]. As a result, there are multiple notion of support of a function. Thus, we define the following:

Given a [[pointed set]] $A$ with specified [[element]] $0 \in A$, a [[set]] $X$, and a [[function]] $f \colon X \to A$, the **support** of $f$ is the [[subset]] of $X$ on which $f$ is not equal to $0$.

Given a [[pointed set]] $A$ with an [[tight apartness relation]] $\#$ and specified [[element]] $0 \in A$, a [[set]] $X$, and a [[function]] $f \colon X \to A$, the **strong support** of $f$ is the [[subset]] of $X$ on which $f$ is apart from $0$.

### In topology

 {#InTopology}

In [[topology]] the support of a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to A$ as above is the [[topological closure]] of the set of points on which $f$ does not vanish:

$$
  Supp(f) = Cl(\{x \in X \vert f(x) \neq 0 \in A\})
  \,.
$$

If $Supp(f) \subset X$ is a [[compact subspace]], then one says that $f$ has _[[compact support]]_.

## Idea 

One of the most important observations of [[category theory]] is that large parts of mathematics can be [[internalization|internalized]] in any [[category]] with sufficient structure.  The most basic examples of this involve algebraic structures; for instance, a [[group]] can be defined in any category with finite products, and an [[internal category|internal]] [[strict category]] can be defined in any ambient category with [[pullback]]s. For such [[algebraic theory|algebraic]] (or even [[essentially algebraic theory|essentially algebraic]]) structures, which are defined by _operations_ with _equational axioms_ imposed, it suffices for the ambient category to have (usually finite) limits.

However, if we assume that the ambient category has additional structure, then much more of mathematics can be internalized, potentially including [[field]]s, [[local ring]]s, [[finite set]]s, [[topological space]]s, even the field of [[real number]]s.  The idea is to exploit the fact that all mathematics can be written in the language of [[logic]], and seek a way to internalize logic in a category with sufficient structure.

The basic ideas of the internal logic induced by a given [[category]] $C$ are:

* the [[object]]s $A$ of $C$ are regarded as collections of things of a given [[type]] $A$

* the [[morphisms]] $A\to B$ of $C$ are regarded as terms of type $B$ containing a free [[variable]] of type $A$ (i.e. in a [[context]] $x:A$)

* a [[subobject]] $\phi \hookrightarrow A$ is regarded as a _proposition_ ([[predicate]]): by thinking of it as the sub-collection of all those things of type $A$ for which the statement $\phi$ is [[true]]

  * the maximal subobject is hence the proposition that is always true; this is the logical object of [[truth]] $\top \hookrightarrow A$

  * the minimal subobject is hence the proposition that is always false; this is the logical object of [[falsity]] $\bottom \hookrightarrow A$

  * one proposition [[implication|implies]] another if as subobjects of $A$ they are connected by a morphism in the [[poset]] of subobjects: $\phi \Rightarrow \psi$ means $\phi \hookrightarrow \psi$

* Logical operations are implemented by [[universal construction]]s on [[subobject]]s.
  
  * the conjunction [[and]] is the [[product]] of subobjects (their [[meet]])

  * the conjunction [[or]] is the [[coproduct]] of subobjects (their [[join]])

and so on.

* A [[dependent type]] over an object $A$ of $C$ may be interpreted as a morphism $B\to A$ whose "fibers" represent the types $B(x)$ for $x:A$.  This morphism might be restricted to be a [[display map]] or a [[fibration]].

Once we formalize the notion of "logical [[theory]]", the construction of the internal logic can be interpreted as a [[functor]] $Lang$ from suitably structured categories to theories.  The morphisms of theories are "interpretations", and so an internalization of some theory $T$ (such as the "theory of groups") into a category $C$ is a morphism of theories $T\to Lang(C)$.

Moreover, the functor $Lang$ has a left [[adjoint functor]]: the [[syntactic category]] $Syn$ of a theory.  Thus, a model of $T$ in $C$ is equally well a functor $Syn(T)\to C$.  Frequently, this adjunction is even an [[equivalence of categories]]; see [[relation between type theory and category theory]].


### Kinds of internal logics in different categories

There are many different kinds of of "logical theories", each of which corresponds to a type of category in which such theories can be internalized (and yields a corresponding adjunction $Syn \dashv Lang$).

|Theory| |Category|
|------|-|--------|
|[[Lawvere theory|Lawvere]] (or "finite product")| |category with [[finite products]]|
|[[cartesian logic|cartesian]]/[[essentially algebraic theory|essentially algebraic]] (or "left exact" or "finite limit")| |[[finitely complete category]]|
|[[minimal logic]]| |[[cartesian closed category]]
|[[regular logic|regular]]| |[[regular category]]|
|[[coherent logic|coherent]]| |[[coherent category]]|
|[[disjunctive logic|disjunctive]]| |[[pre-lextensive category]]|
|[[geometric logic|geometric]]| |[[coherent category|infinitary coherent category]] (aka [[geometric category]])|
|[[constructive logic|constructive]] [[first-order logic|first-order]]| |[[Heyting category]]|
|[[classical logic|classical]] [[first-order logic|first-order]]| |[[Boolean category]]|
|[[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[dependent types]]| |[[locally cartesian closed category]]|
|[[constructive logic|constructive]] [[higher order logic|higher order]]| |[[topos|elementary topos]]|
|[[classical logic|classical]] [[higher order logic|higher order]]| |[[Boolean topos]]|
|[[linear logic]]| |[[symmetric monoidal category]]|
|[[cohesive homotopy type theory|cohesive modal logic]]| |[[cohesive topos]]|

Each type of logic up to and including "geometric" can also be described in terms of [[sketch|sketches]].  Not coincidentally, the corresponding types of category up to and including "geometric" fit into the framework of [[familial regularity and exactness]].  Sketches can also describe theories applicable to categories not even having finite products, such as finite sum sketches, but the type-theoretic approach taken on this page requires at least finite products (or else something closely akin, such as a [[cartesian multicategory]]).

However, there are other sorts of [[internalization]] that do not fit in this framework.  For instance, to describe a [[monoid]] internal to a [[monoidal category]], one needs an internal [[linear logic]].  See [[internalization]] for a discussion of the more  general notion in the context of [[doctrine]]s.


## Internal first-order logic

We begin with the interpretation of internal first-order logic, which is the most used in [[toposes]] and related categories.

### Theories

In this section, what we mean by a _theory_ is a _[[type theory]]_ without dependent types, but with a dependent logic.  This entails the following.

* The [[signature (in logic)|signature]] of the theory consists of

  * Various _[[types]]_ $A,B,C$.  For example, the theory of a group has only one type (group elements), but the theory of a-ring-and-a-module has two types (ring elements and module elements).  There are also generally _type constructors_ that build new types from basic ones, such as product types $A\times B$ and the unit type $1$.

  * The theory will also generally contain _[[function symbol]]s_ such as $f:A\to B$, each with a source and target that are types.  For example, the theory of a monoid has one type $M$, one function symbol $m:M\times M\to M$, and one function symbol $e:1\to M$.  Function symbols of source $1$ are also called _constants_.

  * The theory may also contain _[[relation symbol]]s_ $R:A$, each equipped with a type.  For example, the theory of a [[partial order|poset]] has one type $P$ and one relation $\le:P\times P$.  The most basic relation symbol, which most theories contain, is _[[equality]]_ $=_A:A\times A$ on a type $A$.

* Finally the theory may contain _logical [[axiom]]s_ of the form $\Gamma | \varphi  \vdash \psi$.  Here $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are first-order formulas built up from terms and relation symbols using logical connectives and quantifiers such as $\top,\bot,\wedge,\vee,\Rightarrow,\neg,\forall,\exists$, and $\Gamma$ is a _[[context]]_ which declares the type of every variable occurring in $\varphi$ and $\psi$.

For example, the theory of a group has one type $G$, three function symbols $m:G\times G\to G$, $i:G\to G$, and $e:1\to G$, and axioms
$$\array{
  x:G,y:G,z:G |  \top \vdash m(m(x,y),z) = m(x,m(y,z))\\
  x:G | \top \vdash m(x,i(x)) = e \;\wedge\; m(i(x),x) = e\\
  x:G | \top \vdash m(x,e) = x \;\wedge\; m(e,x) = x.
}$$
This is an _[[equational theory]]_, meaning that each axiom is just one or more equations between terms that must hold in a given context.  For a different sort of example, the theory of a poset has one type $P$, one relation $\le:P\times P$, and axioms
$$\array{
  x:P | \top \vdash x\le x\\
  x:P,y:P | x\le y \;\wedge\; y\le x \vdash x=y\\
  x:P,y:P,z:P | x\le y \;\wedge\; y\le z \vdash x\le z.
}$$


### Categorical semantics {#CategoricalSemantics}

Now suppose that we have a category $C$ with [[finite limit]]s and we want to interpret such a theory internally in $C$. We identify the aspects of the theory with structures in the category by what is called [[categorical semantics]]: 

First, for each _type_ in the theory we choose an [[object]] of $C$.  Then for each _function symbol_ in the theory we choose a [[morphism]] in $C$.  And finally, for each _relation_ in the theory we choose a [[subobject]] in $C$. (We always interpret the relation of _equality_ on a type $A$ by the diagonal $A\hookrightarrow A\times A$ in $C$.)  Thus, for example, to interpret the theory of a group in $C$ we must choose an object $G$ and morphisms $m:G\times G\to G$, $i:G\to G$, and $e:1\to G$, while to interpret the theory of a poset, we must choose an object $P$ and a subobject $[\le] \hookrightarrow P\times P$.

Of course, this is not enough; we need to say somehow that _the axioms are satisfied_.  We first define, inductively, an interpretation of every _term_ that can be constructed from the theory by a morphism in $C$.  For example, given an object $G$ and a morphism $m:G\times G\to G$, there are two evident morphisms $G\times G\times G \to G$ which are the interpretations of the two terms $m(m(x,y),z)$ and $m(x,m(y,z))$.

We then define, inductively, an interpretation of every _[[logical formula]]_ that can be constructed from the theory by a _subobject_ in $C$.  The idea is that if $x:A$ is a variable of type $A$ and $\varphi(x)$ is a formula with $x$ as its free variable, then the interpretation of $\varphi(x)$ should be the "subset" $\{x\in A | \varphi(x)\}$ of $A$.  The base case of this induction is that if $t$ is a term interpreted by a morphism $A\to B$ and $R:B$ is a relation symbol, then $R(t)$ is interpreted by the pullback of the chosen subobject $R\hookrightarrow B$ representing $R$ along the morphism $t:A\to B$.  The building blocks of logical formulas then correspond to operations on the posets $Sub(A)$ of subobjects in $C$, as follows.

|Logical operator| |Operation on $Sub(A)$|
|----------------|-|---------------------|
|[[logical conjunction|conjunction]]: $\wedge$| |[[intersection]] (pullback)|
|[[truth]]: $\top$| |[[top element]] ($A$ itself)|
|[[disjunction]]: $\vee$| |[[union]]|
|[[falsity]]: $\bot$| |[[bottom element]] ([[initial object|strict initial object]])|
|[[implication]]: $\Rightarrow$| |[[Heyting algebra|Heyting implication]]|
|[[existential quantification]]: $\exists$| |[[left adjoint]] to [[pullback]]|
|[[universal quantification]]: $\forall$| |[[right adjoint]] to [[pullback]]|

The fact that existential and universal quantifiers can be interpreted as left and right adjoints to pullbacks was first realized by [[Bill Lawvere]].  One way to realize that it makes sense is to notice that in [[Set]], the image of a subset $R\subset A$ under a function $f:A\to B$ can be defined as
$$\{b\in B | (\exists a\in A)(a\in R \;\wedge\; f(a)=b)\},$$
while its "dual image" (the right adjoint to pullback) can be defined as
$$\{b\in B | (\forall a \in A)(f(a)=b \Rightarrow a\in R)\}.$$

Of course, not in all finitely complete categories $C$ do all these operations on subobjects exist.  Moreover, in order for the relationship with logic to be well-behaved, any of the operations we make use of must be *[[pullback stability|stable]] under* (preserved by) pullbacks.  (Pullbacks of subobjects correspond to "innocuous" logical operations such as adding extra unused variables, duplicating variables, and so on, so they should definitely not affect the meaning of the logical connectives.  However, in [[linear logic]] such operations become less innocuous.)

In any category with finite limits, the posets $Sub(A)$ always have finite intersections (given by pullback), including a top element (given by $A$ itself).  Thus in any such category, we can interpret logical theories that use only the connectives $\wedge$ and $\top$.  This includes both the theories of groups and posets considered above.  
In a [[regular category]], the existence of pullback-stable [[image]]s implies that the [[base change]] functor $f^*:Sub(B)\to Sub(A)$ along any map $f:A\to B$ has a left adjoint, usually written $\exists_f$, and that these adjoints "commute with pullbacks" in an appropriate sense (given by the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]]).  Thus, in a regular category we can interpret any theory in so-called _[[regular logic]]_, which uses only $\wedge$, $\top$, and $\exists$.

Actually, some instances of $\exists$ can be interpreted in any category with finite limits: if $f$ is itself a monomorphism, then $f^*$ always has a left adjoint, given simply by composition with $f$. On the logical side, this means that we can interpret "provably unique existence" in any category with finite limits.  Logic with $\wedge$, $\top$, and "provably unique existence" is called _cartesian logic_ or _finite-limit logic_.

A [[coherent category]] is basically defined to be a [[regular category]] in which the subobject posets additionally have pullback-stable finite unions.  Thus, in a coherent category we can interpret so-called _coherent logic_, which adds $\vee$ and $\bot$ to [[regular logic]].  Likewise, in an infinitary-coherent (or "geometric") category we can interpret _geometric logic_, which adds infinitary disjunctions $\bigvee_i \varphi_i$ to coherent logic.  Geometric logic is especially important because it is preserved by the inverse image parts of [[geometric morphism]]s, and because any geometric theory has a [[classifying topos]].

On the other hand, in a [[extensive category|lextensive category]], we do not have images or all unions, but if we have two subobjects of $A$ which are _disjoint_ (their intersection is initial), then their coproduct is also their union in $Sub(A)$.  Therefore, in a lextensive category we can interpret _disjunctive logic_, which is cartesian logic plus $\bot$ and "provably disjoint disjunction."  Likewise, in an infinitary-lextensive category we can interpret "infinitary-disjunctive logic."

Finally, in a [[Heyting category]] the base change functors $f^*:Sub(B)\to Sub(A)$ also have right adjoints, usually written $\forall_f$, and it is easy to see that this implies that each $Sub(A)$ is also a [[Heyting algebra]], hence has an "implication" $\Rightarrow$ as well.  (We define "negation" by $\neg \varphi \equiv \varphi \Rightarrow \bot$.)  Thus, in a Heyting category we can interpret all of (finitary, first-order) [[intuitionistic logic]].

Now that we know how to interpret logic, we can say that a **model** of a given theory in $C$ consists of a choice of objects, morphisms, and subobjects for the types, function symbols, and relation symbols as above, such that for each axiom $\Gamma | \varphi \vdash \psi$, we have $[\varphi]\le [\psi]$ in $Sub([\Gamma])$.  Here, $[\Gamma]$ is the product of the objects that correspond to the types of the variables in $\Gamma$, $[\varphi]$ and $[\psi]$ are the interpretations of the formulas $\varphi$ and $\psi$ as subobjects of $[\Gamma]$, and $\leq$ is the relation of subobject inclusion.

It is easy to verify that a model of the theory of a group in $C$ is precisely an internal [[group]] object in $C$, as usually defined.  For instance, the validity of the axiom
$$x:G,y:G,z:G | \top \vdash m(m(x,y),z) = m(x,m(y,z))$$
 means that the [[equalizer]] of the two morphisms $G\times G\times G \to G$ must be all of $G\times G\times G$, or equivalently that those two morphisms must be equal.  The same happens in most other cases.


### The internal logic as a functor

As described above, a model of a given theory $T$ in a category $C$ consists of an assignment

| | | |
|---------------- |-| ---------------------|
|types of $T$|$\to$|objects of $C$|
|function symbols of $T$|$\to$|morphisms of $C$|
|relation symbols of $T$|$\to$|subobjects in $C$|
|axioms of $T$|$\to$|containments in $C$|

This is a sort of [[heteromorphism]] in that it changes the name of things as it operates on them.  We can describe it more simply as a "translation of theories" as follows.

Given a category $C$ (which may be regular, coherent, geometric, Heyting, etc.), we define its **internal type theory (with first-order logic)** $Lang(C)$ to be the theory whose

* types are the objects of $C$;
* function symbols are the morphisms on $C$;
* relation symbols are the subobjects in $C$;
* axioms are the containments in $C$.

Now a model of $T$ in $C$ can be described simply as a morphism of theories (a "translation" or "interpretation")

$$T \to Lang(C).$$

The functor $Lang : Categories \to Theories$ has a left adjoint, the [[syntactic category]] of a theory.  Thus we have a chain of natural isomorphisms

$$ Theories(T,Lang(C)) \cong Models(T,C) \cong Categories(Syn(T),C)). $$


## Soundness and internal reasoning 

Internal logic is not just a way to concisely describe internal structures in a category, but also gives us a way to _prove_ things about them by "internal reasoning."  We simply need to verify that the "usual" methods of logical reasoning (for example, from $\varphi\vdash \psi$ and $\psi\vdash \chi$ deduce $\varphi\vdash\chi$) are _internally valid_, in the sense that if the premises are satisfied in some model $C$ (in the example, if $[\varphi]\le [\psi]$ and $[\psi]\le [\chi]$) then so is the conclusion (in the example, $[\varphi]\le [\chi]$).  This is called the _Soundness Theorem_.

It then follows that if we start from the axioms of a theory and "reason normally" within type theory, which in practice amounts to pretending that the types are sets, the function symbols are functions, and the relation symbols are subsets, then anything we prove will still be true when the theory is interpreted in an _arbitrary_ category, not just [[Set]].  For example, by easy equational reasoning from the theory of a group, we can prove that inverses are unique, which is expressed by the logical sequent
$$x:G,y:G,z:G | m(x,y)=e \;\wedge\; m(x,z)=e \vdash y=z.$$
It follows that this is also true, suitably interpreted, as a statement about internal group objects in _any_ category.

There are (at least) three caveats.  Firstly, we must take care to use only the rules appropriate to the fragment of logic that is valid in the particular categories we are interested in.  For example, if we want our conclusions to be valid in any [[regular category]], we must restrict ourselves to reasoning "within regular logic."  Most mathematicians are not familiar with making such distinctions in their reasoning, but in practice most things one would want to say about a regular theory turn out to be provable in regular logic.  (We will not spell out the details of what this means.)  And once we are in a Heyting category, and in particular in a topos, this problem goes away and we can use full first-order logic.

The second, more important, caveat is that the internal logic of all these categories is, in general, [[constructive mathematics|constructive]]. This means that, among other things, the interpretation of $\neg\neg\varphi$ is, in general, distinct from that of $\varphi$, and that $\varphi\vee \neg\varphi$ is not always valid.  So even if we believe that [[classical logic]] (including the principle of [[excluded middle]] and even the [[axiom of choice]]) is "true," as many mathematicians do, there is still a reason to look for proofs that are constructively acceptable, since it is only these which are valid in the internal logic of most categories.  If the category is [[Boolean category|Boolean]] and/or satisfies the internal [[axiom of choice]], however, then this problem goes away, but these fail in many categories in which one wants to internalize (such as many [[Grothendieck topos]]es).

The third caveat is that one must take care to distinguish the _internal_ logic of a category from what is _externally_ true about it.  In general, internal validity is "local" truth, meaning things which become true "after passing to a [[cover]]."  This is particularly important for formulas involving _disjunction_ and _existence_.  For example, an object's being [[projective object|projective]] in the category $C$ is a different statement from its being _internally_ projective, meaning that "$X$ is projective" is true in the internal logic.  Another good example can be found in the different notions of [[finite object]] in a topos.  This problem goes away if the ambient category is [[well-pointed topos|well-pointed]], but well-pointed categories are even rarer than Boolean ones satisfying choice; the only well-pointed Grothendieck topos is [[Set]] itself.


## Completeness, syntactic categories, and Morita equivalence
{#syntactic_categories}

The converse of the Soundness Theorem is called the _Completeness Theorem_, and states that if a sequent $\varphi\vdash\psi$ is valid in every model of a theory, then it is _provable_ from that theory.  This is noticeably less trivial.  In classical first-order logic, where the only models considered are set-valued ones, the completeness theorem is usually proven using [[ultraproduct]]s.  However, in categorical logic there is a more elegant approach (which additionally no longer depends on any form of the [[axiom of choice]]).

The **[[syntactic category]]** $C_T = Syn(T)$ of a theory $T$ was mentioned above, as the left adjoint to the "internal logic functor" $Lang$.  By the [[Yoneda lemma]], the syntactic category $C_T$ contains a "generic" model of the theory.  Moreover, by the construction of $C_T$ (see [[syntactic category]]), the valid sequents in this model are *precisely* those provable from the theory.  Therefore, if a sequent is valid in all models, it is in particular valid in the generic model in $C_T$, and hence provable from $T$.

The universal property of $C_T$ is also sometimes useful for semantic conclusions.  For instance, sometimes one can prove something about the generic model and then carry it over to all models.

Furthermore, if $T$ lives in a sub-fragment of geometric logic (such as regular, coherent, lextensive, or geometric logic), then the [[Grothendieck topos]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $C_T$ for its appropriate (regular, coherent, extensive, or geometric) [[coverage]] contains a $T$-model which is generic for models in Grothendieck toposes: any $T$-model in a Grothendieck topos is its image under the inverse image of a unique [[geometric morphism]].  This topos is called the **[[classifying topos]]** of the theory.

The [[syntactic category]] of a theory can be considered as the "extensional essence" of that theory, since functors out of $C_T$ completely determine the $T$-models in any category $D$ with suitable structure.  It therefore makes sense, in some contexts, to define a _morphism_ of theories to be a functor between their [[syntactic categories]], and an _equivalence_ of theories (sometimes called a _Morita equivalence_) to be an equivalence between their syntactic categories.

A morphism $T\to T'$ between theories, in this sense, induces a functor from $T'$-models in $D$ to $T$-models in $D$, for any category $D$ with suitable structure, in a way which is natural in $D$.  In particular, theories which are "Morita equivalent" in this sense have naturally equivalent categories of models in all categories $D$ with suitable structure; so they have the same "meaning" even though they may be presented quite differently.  (Note that this is a much stronger sort of equivalence than merely having equivalent categories of models in some particular category, such as $Set$.)  Moreover, the fact that the syntactic category is defined "syntactically" means that a morphism $T\to T'$ actually induces a "translation" of the types, functions, and relations of $T$ into those of $T'$.

By first applying various "completion" processes to syntactic categories before asking about equivalence, we obtain coarser notions of equivalence, which only induce equivalences of models in more restricted sorts of categories.  For instance, if we compare the [[exact completion]]s of syntactic categories of regular theories, we obtain a notion of equivalence that induces equivalences of categories of models in all exact categories (not necessarily all regular ones).  Likewise for coherent theories and [[pretopos]]es, and for geometric theories and infinitary pretoposes.  Note, though, that the infinitary-pretopos completion of a (small) geometric theory is in fact already a (Grothendieck) topos, and coincides with the classifying topos considered above.  Thus, passage to classifying toposes is also an instance of this construction, and an equivalence of classifying toposes means that two theories have equivalent categories of models in all toposes.  (This is still much stronger than just having equivalent categories of models in $Set$.)

## Examples

### Internal logic in $Set$ {#LogicOfSet}

The [[topos]] [[Set]] in [[classical mathematics]] of course has as its internal logic the "ordinary" logic. This is reproduced by following the abstract nonsense as follows:

the [[terminal object]] of [[Set]] is [[generalized the|the]] one-element set ${*}$, the [[subobject classifier]] in [[Set]] is the two-element set $\Omega = \{true, false\}$ equipped with the map

$$
  T : {*} \to \Omega
$$

that picks the element $true$ in $\Omega$. The [[Heyting algebra]] of [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object]] is the [[poset]]

$$
  L = \{  \emptyset \hookrightarrow {*} \}
$$

consisting only of the two trivial subobjects of $*$, the point itself and the empty set, and the unique inclusion morphism between them. These are classified, respectively, by the [[truth value]]s ${*} \stackrel{true}{\to} \Omega$ and ${*} \stackrel{false}{\to} \Omega$, so that we can also write our [[poset]] of [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object]] as

$$
  L = \{  false \to true \}
  \,.
$$

The logical operation $\wedge = AND$ is the [[product]] in the [[poset]] $L$. Indeed we find pullback diagrams in $L$

$$
  \array{
    true \times \true = true &\to& true
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    true
  }
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    true \times false = false &\to& false
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    true
  }
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    false \times false = false &\to& false
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    false
  }
  \,.
$$

The logical operation $\vee = OR$ is the [[coproduct]] in the [[poset]] $L$. Indeed we find [[pushout]] diagrams in $L$

$$
  \array{
    && true
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    true
    &\to&
    true \coprod \true = true   
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;
   \array{
    && false
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    true
    &\to&
    true \coprod false = true
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;
   \array{
    && false
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    false
    &\to&
    false \coprod false = false
  }
 \,.
$$

The logical operation $\not = NOT$ is given by the [[internal hom]] into the [[initial object]] in $L$:

$$
  \not = hom(-, false) : L^{op} \to L
  \,.
$$

We find the value of the [[internal hom]] by its defining [[adjunction]]. For $hom(true,false)$ we have

$$
  Hom_L(true, hom(true,false)) \simeq Hom_L(true \times true, false) = Hom_L(true, false) = \emptyset
$$

and

$$
  Hom_L(false, hom(true,false)) \simeq Hom_L(false \times true, false) = Hom_L(false, false) = {*}
$$

from which we deduce that

$$
  hom(true,false) = false\,.
$$

Similarly for $hom(false,false)$ we have

$$
  Hom_L(true, hom(false,false)) \simeq 
  Hom_L(true \times false, false)
  = Hom_L(false, false) = {*}
$$

and

$$
  Hom_L(false, hom(false,false)) \simeq 
  Hom_L(false \times false, false)
  = Hom_L(false, false) = {*}
$$

from which we deduce that 

$$
  hom(false,false) = true
  \,.
$$

This way all the familiar logical operations are recovered from the internal logic of the [[topos]] [[Set]].



### Internal logic in a sheaf topos on open subsets 
 {#LogicOfPresheaves}

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $Op(X)$ its [[category of open subsets]] and $Sh(X) := Sh(Op(X))$ the [[Grothendieck topos]] of [[category of sheaves|sheaves]] on $X$.

We discuss the internal logic of this sheaf topos (originally [Tarski, 1938 ](#Tarski)).

The [[terminal object]] is the sheaf [[representable functor|represented by]] $X$: the one that is constant on the one-element set

$$
  X : U \mapsto {*}
  \,.
$$

The [[subobject]]s of this object are the [[representable functor|representable presheaves]]

$$
  hom(-,V) : U \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      {*} & | if U \subset V
      \\
      \emptyset & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$

for $V \in Op(X)$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
In the *[[presheaf]]* topos $PSh(Op(X))= Func(Op(X)^{op},Set)$, the subobjects of $1$ are arbitrary [[sieves]] in $Op(X)$, not just representables.  For instance, for any two open sets $U$ and $V$ there is a sieve consisting of all open sets contained in either $U$ or $V$, which doesn't necessarily contain $U\cup V$.  It's only in the *sheaf* topos $Sh(X)$ that the representables are precisely the subobjects of $1$.  
=--

The [[poset]] of [[subobject]]s formed by these is just the [[category of open subsets]] itself:

$$
  L = Op(X)
  \,.
$$

* The logical operation $AND$ is the [[product]] in $Op(X)$: this is the **intersection** of open subsets.

* The logical operation $OR$ is the [[coproduct]] in $Op(X)$: this is the **union** of open subsets.

* The [[internal hom]] in $Op(X)$ is given by

  $$
    hom(U,V) = (U^c \vee V)^\circ
  $$

  (the interior of the union of the complement of $U$ 
  with V).

  So **negation** is given by sending an open subset 
  to the interior of its complement:
 
  $$
    \not U = hom(U,\emptyset)
    = (U^c \vee \emptyset)^\circ = (U^c)^\circ
    \,.
  $$

In particular we find that in the internal logic of $PSh(X)$ the law of the [[excluded middle]] fails in general, as in general we do not have that 

$$
  (\not U) \vee U = true
$$

because $\not U \vee U = (U^c)^\circ \cup U = X \backslash \partial U$ is the total space $X$ without the boundary (frontier) of $U$, and not $true = X$, all of the total space.

Thus, the internal logic of this [[Grothendieck topos|sheaf topos]] is (in general) [[intuitionistic logic]].  As remarked above, this is the case in many toposes.

### General

Most books on topos theory develop some internal logic, at least in the context of a topos.  For example:

* [[Saunders Mac Lane]] [[Ieke Moerdijk]], _[[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic]]_ 

* Goldblatt, _Topoi: the categorial analysis of logic_

* [[Francis Borceux]], Section 6 of: _[[Handbook of Categorical Algebra]]_, Vol 3: _Categories of Sheaves_, Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications **50**

* [[Peter Johnstone]], Part D of: _[[Sketches of an Elephant]]_

is comprehensive.

Phoa has a presentation of the internal logic of a topos over a dependent type theory, as opposed to other systems which use simple type theory. This is system is not minimal, but close to what is used in practice [PS](http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/92/ECS-LFCS-92-208/ECS-LFCS-92-208.ps.gz).

The book

* [[Bart Jacobs]], _Categorical Logic and Type Theory_ 

works in the even more general context of [[Grothendieck fibration|fibrations]], allowing us to associate to each object $A$ an arbitrary poset instead of $Sub(A)$.

The book

* [[Paul Taylor]], _[[Practical Foundations of Mathematics]]_ 

is arguably all about this subject (although you wouldn\'t know it until about Chapter VIII), but from a different perspective.  In particular, Taylor allows us to replace having *all* pullbacks with pullbacks along a pullback-stable class of [[display morphisms]].

A discussion of [[dependent type theory]] as the [[internal language]] of [[locally cartesian closed categories]] is in 

* [[R. A. G. Seely]], _Locally cartesian closed categories and type theory_, Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. (1984) 95 ([pdf](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/LCCC/LCCC.pdf))

The observation that the poset of open subsets of a topological space serve as a model for [[intuitionistic logic]] is apparently originally due to

## Idea

An **ordinary differential equation** is a [[differential equation]] involving [[derivatives]] of a [[function]] with respect to one argument only, i.e. the function is on a [[manifold]] only of [[dimension]] $d = 1$. This function can be vector valued, what is sometimes viewed as a system of possibly coupled equations; still all of them have the derivatives taken with respect to the same parameter. (Note that a higher-order differential equation can be turned into a system of first-order equations.)


## Existence and uniqueness (Picard--Lindel&#246;f theorem) 

A basic theorem concerns existence and uniqueness of local solutions to initial value problems. Let $X$ be a [[Banach space]]; given $(t_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R} \times X$ and $a, r \gt 0$, put $Q \coloneqq [t_0 - a, t_0 + a] \times B_r(y_0)$m where $B_r(y_0)$ is the closed [[ball]] in $X$ of radius $r$ about $y_0$.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem 
**(Picard--Lindel&#246;f)** 
Suppose $f: Q \to X$ is a [[function]] satisfying the following conditions: 

* ([[continuous function|Continuity]] in $t$): Given any $x \in B_r(y_0)$, the function $f(-,x)$ (that is $t \mapsto f(t, x)$) is continuous from $[t_0 - a, t_0 + a]$ to $X$.

* ([[Lipschitz continuous function|Lipschitz continuity]] in $y$): There is a Lipschitz constant $L$ such that 
$$ {\|f(t, x) - f(t, x')\|} \leq L{\|x - x'\|} $$ 
for all $(t, x) \in Q$; 

* ([[bounded function|Boundedness]]): There is a constant $K$ such that $\sup_{(t, x) \in Q} \|f(t, x)\| \leq K$. 

Then for any $c \leq \min(a, r/K)$, there exists [[uniqueness|exactly one]] solution $y: [t_0 - c, t_0 + c] \to X$ to the initial value problem 

$$ y'(t) = f(t, y(t)), \qquad y(t_0) = y_0 .$$ 
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof sketch

We will define an [[infinite sequence]] of approximate solutions to the problem, prove that its [[convergence|limit]] exists, prove that this limit is an exact solution, and prove that this solution is unique.

1. The infinite sequence is given by __Picard iteration__:
Starting with the given constant $y_0$, [[recursion|recursively]] define

   $$ y_{n+1}(t) \coloneqq y_0 + \int_{t=t_0} f(t, y_n(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t ;$$

   that is, $y_{n+1}$ is that [[indefinite integral]] of $f(-,y_n)$ that takes the correct initial value.  (To define $y_1$, use [[abuse of notation]] to interpret $y_0(t)$ as $y_0$; that is, think of $y_0$ as a [[constant function]].)  To prove that this integral exists, use the continuity conditions and an [[inductive proof]] that each $y_n$ is continuous to show that we are integrating a continuous function.

2. Thinking of Picard iteration as an operator between Banach spaces of continuous functions, use Lipschitz continuity and boundedness to show that the [[Banach fixed point theorem]] applies, so that the sequence $(y_1, y_2, \ldots)$ [[uniform convergence|uniformly converges]] to a limit $y$.

3. Since uniform convergence of continuous functions behaves well with integration, the limiting instance of Picard iteration holds:

   $$ y(t) = y_0 + \int_{t=t_0} f(t, y(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t .$$

   By differentiating with respect to $t$, and by evaluating at $t_0$, we confirm that $y$ is a solution of the initial value problem.

4. Given any putative solution $z$, apply [[Groenwall inequality|Grönwall's inequality]] to $z - y$ to prove that $z = y$.

## Idea

The _singular homology_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is the [[simplicial homology]] of its [[singular simplicial complex]]:

a **singular $n$-[[chain]]** on $X$ is a [[formal linear combination]] of [[singular simplices]] $\sigma : \Delta^n \to X$, and a singular $n$-[[cycle]] is such a chain such that its oriented [[boundary]] in $X$ vanishes. Two singular chains are **homologous** if they differ by a boundary. The **singular homology** of $X$ in degree $n$ is the group of $n$-cycles modulo those that are boundaries.

Singular homology of a topological space conincide with its [[ordinary homology]] as defined more abstractly (see at [[generalized homology theory]]).

(Here "singular" refers to the contrast with [[cellular homology]], referring to the fact that a [[simplex]] $\Delta_{top} \to X$ in the [[singular simplicial complex]] is not required to be a [[topological embedding]], but may be a "singular map", such as for instance a [[constant function]].)

## Definition
 {#Definition}


Let $X \in $ [[Top]] be [[topological space]]. 
Write $Sing X \in $ [[sSet]] for its [[singular simplicial complex]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a **singular $n$-chain** on $X$ is
an element in the [[free abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[(Sing X)_n]$:

a [[formal linear combinations]] of [[singular simplices]] in $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

These are the [[chains on a simplicial set]] on $Sing X$.

=--

The groups of singular chains combine to the [[simplicial abelian group]]
$\mathbb{Z}[Sing X] \in Ab^{\Delta^{op}}$. 

+-- {: .num_defn #SingularComplex}
###### Definition

The [[alternating face map complex]] 

$$
  C_\bullet(X)
    \coloneqq 
  C_\bullet(\mathbb{Z}[Sing X]) \in Ch_\bullet
$$ 

is the **singular complex** of $X$. 

Its [[chain homology]] is the ordinary **singular homology** of $X$.

=--

One usually writes $H_n(X, \mathbb{Z})$ or just $H_n(X)$ for the singular homology of $X$ in degree $n$. See also at _[[ordinary homology]]_.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

So we have

$$
  C_\bullet(X)
  = 
  [
    \cdots
     \stackrel{\partial_2}{\to}
    \mathbb{Z}[(Sing X)_2]
     \stackrel{\partial_1}{\to}
    \mathbb{Z}[(Sing X)_1]
     \stackrel{\partial_0}{\to}
    \mathbb{Z}[(Sing X)_0]
  ]
$$

where the differentials are defined on [[basis]] elements 
$\sigma \in (Sing X)_n$ by

$$
  \partial_n \sigma 
    = 
  -
  \sum_{i = 0}^n
    (-1)
    d_i \sigma 
$$

(with $d_i$ the $i$ [[simplicial set|simplicial face map]]) and then extended linearly. 

(One may change the global signs and obtain a [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] complex, in particular with the same homology groups.)

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This means that a [[singular chain]] is a [[cycle]] if the formal linear combination of the oriented [[boundaries]] of all its constituent [[singular simplices]] sums to 0. See the  _[basic examples](#BasicExamples)_ below

=--

More generally, for $R$ any unital [[ring]] one can form the degreewise [[free module]] $R[Sing X]$ over $R$. The corresponding homology is the _singular homology with coefficients in $R$, denoted $H_n(X,R)$.

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Given a [[continuous map]] $f : X \to Y$ between topological spaces, 
and given $n \in \mathbb{N}$, every singular $n$-simplex $\sigma : \Delta^n \to X$ in $X$ is sent to a singular $n$-simplex 

$$
  f_* \sigma : \Delta^n \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y
$$

in $Y$. This is called the **push-forward** of $\sigma$ along $f$. Accordingly there is a push-forward map on groups of singular chains

$$
  (f_*)_n : C_n(X) \to C_n(Y)
  \,. 
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #PushForwardChainMap}
###### Proposition

These push-forward maps make all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
     C_{n+1}(X) &\stackrel{(f_*)_{n+1}}{\to}& C_{n+1}(Y)
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^X_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^Y_n}}
     \\
     C_n(X) &\stackrel{(f_*)_n}{\to}& C_n(Y)
  }
$$

commute. In other words, push-forward along $f$ constitutes a [[chain map]]

$$
  f_* : C_\bullet(X) \to C_\bullet(Y)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is in fact evident that push-forward yields a functor of [[singular simplicial complexes]]

$$
 f_* : Sing X \to Sing Y
 \,.
$$

From this the statement follows since $\mathbb{Z}[-] : sSet \to sAb$ is a functor.

=--

Accordingly we have:

+-- {: .num_prop #SingularHomologyAsAFunctor}
###### Proposition

Sending a topological space to its singular chain complex $C_\bullet(X)$, def. \ref{SingularComplex}, and a continuous map to its push-forward chain map, 
prop. \ref{PushForwardChainMap}, constitutes a [[functor]]

$$
  C_\bullet(-,R) : Top \to Ch_\bullet(R Mod)
$$

from the category [[Top]] to the [[category of chain complexes]].

In particular for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ singular homology extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  H_n(-,R) : Top \to R Mod
  \,.
$$

###### Example

Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $\sigma^1 : \Delta^1 \to X$
be a singular 1-simplex, regarded as a 1-chain

$$
  \sigma^1 \in C_1(X)
  \,.
$$

Then its [[boundary]] $\partial \sigma \in H_0(X)$ is 

$$
  \partial \sigma^1 = \sigma(0)  -\sigma(1)
$$

or graphically (using notation as for [[orientals]])

$$
  \partial 
  \left(
    \sigma(0) \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} \sigma(1)
  \right)
  = 
  (\sigma(0)) - (\sigma(1))
  \,.
$$

Let $\sigma^2 : \Delta^2 \to X$ be a singular 2-chain. The boundary is

$$
  \partial
  \left(
    \array{
       && \sigma(1)
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\sigma(0,1)}}\nearrow

       \searrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma^{1,2}}}
       \\

       \\
       && && \sigma(2)

### Homology of cells: disks and spheres

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[reduced singular homology]] of the $n$-[[sphere]] $S^n$ is

$$
  \tilde H_k(S^n)
  = 
  \left\{
    \array{
      \mathbb{Z} & if\; k = n  
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The $n$-sphere may be realized as the [[pushout]] 

$$
  S^n \simeq D^n/S^{n-1} \coloneqq D^{n} \coprod_{S^{n-1}} *
$$

which is the $n$-[[ball]] with its [[boundary]] $(n-1)$-sphere identified with the [[point]]. The inclusion $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow D^n$ is a "good pair" in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}, and so the [[long exact sequence]] from prop. \ref{RelativeHomologyLongExactSequence} yields a long exact sequence

$$
  \cdots \to \tilde H_{k+1}(S^n) \to \tilde H_k(S^{n-1}) \to \tilde H_k(D^n) \to \tilde H_k(S^n) \to \tilde H_{k-1}(S^{n-1}) \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

Since the [[disks]] are all [[contractible topological spaces]] we have $H_k(D^n) \simeq 0$ for all $k,n$ by [this example](reduced+homology#ReducedHomologyOfPoints) at _[[reduced homology]]_. This means that in the above long exact sequence all the morphisms

$$
  \tilde H_{k+1}(S^{n+1}) \to \tilde H_k(S^n)
$$

are [[isomorphisms]], for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Since 

$$
  \tilde H_n(S^0) \simeq 
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z} & if \; n = 0
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$ 

(by [this example](reduced+homology#ReducedHomologyOf0Sphere) at _[[reduced homology]]_) the statement follows by [[induction]] on $n$.

For $X$ a topological space the Hurewicz homomorphism in degree 0 exhibits an [[isomorphism]] between the [[free abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[\pi_0(X)]$ on the set of [[connected components]] of $X$ and the degree-0 singular homlogy:

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[\pi_0(X)]
   \simeq
  H_0(X)
  \,.
$$

Since a [[homotopy group]] in positive degree depends on the [[homotopy type]] of the [[connected component]] of the base point, while the singular homology does not depend on a basepoint, it is interesting to compare these groups only for the case that $X$ is connected.

For $X$ a [[connected topological space]] the [[Hurewicz homomorphism]]
in degree 1

$$
  \Phi : \pi_1(X,x) \to H_1(X)
$$

is [[surjection|surjective]]. Its [[kernel]] is the [[commutator subgroup]]
of $\pi_1(X,x)$. Therefore it induces an [[isomorphism]] from the [[abelianization]] $\pi_1(X,x)^{ab} \coloneqq \pi_1(X,x)/[\pi_1,\pi_1]$:

###### Definition

A [[topological subspace]] inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ in [[Top]] is called a **good pair** if 

1. $A$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]] and [[closed subset|closed]] in $X$;

1. $A$ has a [[neighbourhood]] in $X$ of which it is a [[deformation retract]].

Write $X/A$ for the [[cokernel]] of the inclusion, hence for the [[pushout]]

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a good pair, def. \ref{GoodPair}, then the singular homology of $X/A$ coincides with the [[relative homology]] of $X$ relative to $A$.  In particular, therefore, it fits into a [[long exact sequence]] of the form

# Measurable spaces
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

Measurable spaces are the traditional prelude to the general theory of [[measure]] and [[integration]].  Basically, a measure is a recipe for computing the size --- e.g., length, area, volume --- of [[subsets]] of a given [[set]] $X$.  The structure of a 'measurable space' picks out those subsets of $X$ for which the size is well-defined; these subsets are called 'measurable'.  The measure on $X$ is then an operation that assigns a number to each measurable subset saying how big it is.

In short: you get a [[measure space]] by placing a measure on a measurable space.

Ideally, all subsets would be measurable, but this contradicts the [[axiom of choice]] for the basic example of [[Lebesgue measure]] on the [[real line]].  Although it is possible to use nonstandard [[foundations]] of mathematics in which all subsets of the real line are Lebesgue measurable, any general theory that includes that example and is more general than those foundations requires some explicit notion of measurable space (or an alternative such as a [[measurable locale]]).

In any case, measurable spaces are of some interest in their own right, even without a measure on them.


## Definitions

We give first the usual notion, assuming the validity of [[excluded middle]] and [[power sets]]; see below for alternative versions, including the [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] and [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] theories.

Given a [[set]] $X$, a __$\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]]__ is a collection of [[subsets]] of $X$ that is closed under [[complement|complementation]], [[countable set|countable]] [[unions]], and countable [[intersections]].  A __measurable space__, by the usual modern definition, is a set $X$ equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$.  The elements of $\Sigma$ are called the __[[measurable sets]]__ of $X$ (or more properly, the measurable subsets of $(X,\Sigma)$).

Given measurable spaces $X$ and $Y$, a __[[measurable function]]__ from $X$ to $Y$ is a [[function]] $f\colon X \to Y$ such that the [[preimage]] $f^*(T)$ is measurable in $X$ whenever $T$ is measurable in $Y$.  Measurable spaces and measurable functions form a [[category]] [[Meas]], which is [[topological concrete category|topological]] over [[Set]].

In classical measure theory, it is usually assumed that $Y$ is the [[real line]] (or a variation) equipped with the [[Borel sets]] (see the examples below).  Then $f$ is measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(I)$ is measurable whenever $I \subseteq Y$ is an interval.


## Variations

We will briefly examine variations of the notion of measurable space, from those most like the standard to those most unlike it.  Most of these are discussed at articles dedicated to them.

Historically, people have used more general notions that $\sigma$-algebras, such as algebras, $\delta$-rings, and similar concepts whose names you can probably now guess; these are all discussed at [[sigma-algebra]].  These are all more general than $\sigma$-algebras, being possibly not closed under some operations.  When using some of these more general rings of measurable sets, it is necessary to allow [[partial functions]] whose domain is a [[relatively measurable set]] as measurable functions; for details, see [[measurable function]].

An __enhanced measurable space__ has, in addition to the $\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets, a $\sigma$-[[sigma-ideal|ideal]] of __measurable [[null sets]]__.  That is, besides the set $X$ and the $\sigma$-alebra $\Sigma$, we have a collection $N \subseteq \Sigma$ that is closed under [[countable set|countable]] unions and taking subsets (within $\Sigma$).  (The elements of $N$ are the *measurable* null sets; a __[[null set]]__ is *any* subset of a measurable null set.)  One can equivalently specify a $\delta$-[[delta-filter|filter]] of __measurable [[full sets]]__; the full sets are the [[complements]] of the null sets.  Either way, this allows us to use almost measurable [[almost functions]] up to [[almost equality]], as described at [[measurable function]].

In [[constructive mathematics]], because [[complement|complementation]] doesn\'t behave nicely, the concept of $\sigma$-algebra is not so useful.  It\'s also essential to use [[almost functions]] to avoid a paucity of measurable functions.  One solution, due to [[Henry Cheng]], may be found at [[Cheng measurable space]]; briefly, we use [[disjoint pairs]] $(A,B)$ of sets instead of individual measurable sets and use formal complements in the algebra, as well as a notion of [[full sets]].  Assuming [[excluded middle]], a Cheng measurable space is actually equivalent to a measurable space equipped with null (or full) sets, as in the previous paragraph.

In order to have the most important theorems of [[measure theory]], it is necessary and sufficient to restrict to [[localizable measures]].  Since localizability refers only to the null (or full) sets, we can actually speak of a __[[localizable measurable space]]__: a measurable space equipped with null (or full) sets as above, with the property that the [[boolean algebra]] of measurable sets [[quotient algebra|modulo]] the null sets is [[complete lattice|complete]].

Another approach to measure theory, more abstract, is to ignore the set $X$ and use *only* the $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$, as an abstract [[boolean algebra]] equipped with [[countable set|countable]] [[suprema]]; this is called a __[[measurable algebra]]__ (or a [[measure algebra]] when equipped with a [[measure]]).  A measurable algebra might also can be equipped with a $\sigma$-ideal of null sets (or a $\delta$-filter of full sets), but really it is simpler to take the [[quotient algebra]], which is itself a perfectly good measurable algebra.  Even if a measurable algebra is a [[complete lattice]], it can still be pathological; but if it has enough [[normal measure]]s, then we have a __[[measurable locale]]__; the [[category]] of measurable locales is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to that of [[localizable measurable spaces]] (from the previous paragraph).

Yet another category equivalent to localizable measurable spaces and measurable locales is the [[opposite category]] of the category of [[commutative ring|commutative]] [[von Neumann algebras]]; this is really a version of the [[Gelfand–Neumark theorem]].  Then a *[[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative]]* (localizable) measurable space is (the formal dual of) *any* von Neumann algebra.  In this way, measure theory may be seen as a branch of [[operator algebra]] theory (at least if one assumes that only localizable measurable spaces are well enough behaved to be worthy of study).


## Examples

*  Of course, the [[power set]] of $X$ is closed under all operations, so it is a $\sigma$-algebra.  Thus every set becomes a __[[discrete space|discrete]] measurable space__.


*  If $X$ is a [[topological space]], then the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets (or equivalently, by the closed sets) in $X$ is the __Borel $\sigma$-algebra__; its elements are called the __[[Borel sets]]__ of $X$. In particular, the Borel sets of [[real number]]s are the Borel sets in the [[real line]] with its usual topology.


*  If a measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$ is equipped with a measure $\mu$, making it into a [[measure space]], then the sets of measure zero form a $\sigma$-[[sigma-ideal|ideal]] of $\Sigma$ (that is an [[ideal]] that is also a sub-$\sigma$-ring).  Let a __[[null subset|null set]]__ be *any* set (measurable or not) contained in a set of measure zero; then the null sets form a $\sigma$-ideal in the [[power set]] of $X$.  Call a set __$\mu$-measurable__ if it is the union of a measurable set and a null set; then the $\mu$-measurable sets form a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma_\mu$ called the __completion__ of $\Sigma$ under $\mu$, and the measurable space $(X,\Sigma_\mu)$ is the __completion__ of $(X,\Sigma)$.

*  In particular, the __Lebesgue-measurable__ sets in the real line are the elements of the completion of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra under [[Lebesgue measure]].


## Properties

### Relation to von Neumann algebras
 {#RelationToVonNeumannAlgebras}

One version of the [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem|Gel'fand–Naimark theorem]] states that the category of [[commutative algebra|commutative]] $W^*$-[[W*-algebra|algebras]] is [[dual equivalence|dual]] to the category of *localizable* measurable spaces.  (As such, arbitrary $W^*$-algebras may be interpreted as 'noncommutative' measurable spaces in a sense analogous to [[noncommutative geometry]].)  See the [references below](#ReferencesRelationToVonNeumannAlgebras).

To make this work correctly, we cannot simply define localizability as a [[property]] of measurable spaces; instead, a __[[localizable measurable space]]__ is a measurable space (a set $X$ with a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$) with a $\sigma$-[[sigma-ideal|ideal]] $\mathcal{N}$ of $\Sigma$ and $\mathcal{P}X$ simultaneously (called the ideal of __[[null sets]]__) such that $\Sigma/\mathcal{N}$ is a [[complete lattice]]; and a [[morphism]] of localizable measurable spaces is a measurable function, with the property that the [[preimage]] of any null set is null, up to an [[equivalence relation]] where $f \cong g$ if $\{ x \;|\; f(x) \neq g(x) \}$ is a null set.

The requirement that $\Sigma/\mathcal{N}$ be complete is the real localizability condition here; the trick of equipping a measurable space with a $\sigma$-ideal of null sets (or equivalently a $\sigma$-[[filter]] of [[full sets]]) and taking measurable functions only up to equivalence is a common one in other situations.

Localizable measurable spaces can also be studied via the lattice $\Sigma/\mathcal{N}$, which is a [[frame]]; the morphisms correspond to certain [[continuous maps]] between [[locales]], and thus we are studying locales with [[extra structure]], called __[[measurable locales]]__.


### Relation to Boolean toposes

In terms of [[topos theory]], measurable spaces are closely related to [[Boolean toposes]] (e.g. [Jackson 06](#Jackson06), [Henry 14](#Henry14)).

## In alternative foundations

While Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be done in very weak [[foundations]], a general theory of measure and measurable spaces seems to require powerful [[set theory|set-theoretic]] machinery.  Indeed, not much seems to be possible in [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] contexts, and the (nonpredicative) [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] theory is noticeably more complicated than the classical theory.  On the other hand, the classical theory has its own complications, with nonmeasurable sets and functions that can be proved to exist but which seem to never arise in practice.  Instead, there are classically false but apparently consistent foundations in which measure theory is extremely simple.


### Predicative theory
{#Predicative}

The main problem for measure theory in [[predicative mathematics]] is getting your hands on a $\sigma$-algebra.  Once you\'ve got that, you\'ve got a measurable space (obviously) and go on to [[measure space]], where there are no new difficulties.  However, what is (say) a Borel set in the real line?  This is difficult, if not impossible, to explain predicatively.  (In the case of [[Lebesgue measure]], there *are* ways to describe the Lebesgue-measurable sets predicatively, but these do not seem to generalise to a broader theory.)

Note that there is no real problem in describing what, say, an open set is.  Not only can this be done for the real line in the usual $\epsilon$-$\delta$ way, but it is easy to take *any* collection of subsets of any set $X$, call that collection a [[subbase]], and describe which sets are the open sets in the [[topological space|topology]] generated by that subbase.  The reason is that there are only two steps in moving from a subbase to a topology, and while the latter step is too impredicative to allow one to speak of the *set* of all open sets, it\'s OK if you only want to talk about *individual* open sets.  (To be explicit: given a collection $B$ to be used as subbase, a set $G$ is _open_ if, for every point $x$, if $x \in G$, then there exist a [[natural number]] $n$ and elements $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ of $B$ such that $x \in A_i$ for each $i$ and, for every point $y$, if $y \in A_i$ for each $i$, then $y \in G$.  Since we quantify only over points and natural numbers, not over sets or functions, this is a predicative definition, and it\'s easy to prove that the open sets satisfy the axioms of a topology.)

This cannot be done with $\sigma$-algebras, since we need uncountably many sets.  To be sure, each individual step is predicative, and we can freely talk about $G_\delta$ sets and the like, but to define a Borel set we need to quantify over all countable ordinals.  While it is possible to hypothesise the existence of an uncountable ordinal $\omega_1$ and be predicative 'over' $\omega_1$ (and after all, everything else in this section is only predicative over the first infinite ordinal $\omega_0$, which we only have if we accept an [[axiom of infinity]]), this cannot be constructed predicatively.  (The immediate definition of $\omega_1$ as the [[Hartog's number]] of $\omega_0$ uses [[power set]]s; while the construction of an uncountable ordinal by applying the [[well-ordering theorem]] to the [[function set]] $\mathbf{N}^{\mathbf{N}}$ doesn\'t seem to use reasoning that requires the existence of power sets as long as you don\'t also throw in [[excluded middle]], it does use reasoning that is not accepted by any predicative school that I know.)

So as far as I ([[Toby Bartels]]) can tell, there is no general predicative theory of measurable spaces, only an ad hoc theory of Lebsegue measurability.  I would be delighted to learn otherwise!


### Constructive theory

From a constructive perspective, there are a couple of related problems with the classical theory.  One is that the notion of $\sigma$-algebra is highly suspicious, because it relies on an operation, [[complement]]ation, that behaves very differently in the [[intuitionistic logic]] that [[constructive mathematics]] uses.  The other is that, even you acept the definition of $\sigma$-algebra anyway (after all, the Lebesgue-measurable sets on the real line do still form one), there may be very few measurable functions.

Indeed, if we set aside the general theory of measurable spaces and simply do Lebesgue measure ad hoc in a constructive (even predicative) way, we find that instead of measurable [[functions]] we really want measurable [[partial functions]] whose domain of definition is a [[full set]].  This suggests that if we want to define the concept of measurable function, then we have to know what the full sets are.

There is a way out, due to [[Henry Cheng]], for both of these problems at once.  Instead of dealing with individual sets, we will deal with pairs of [[disjoint sets]].  The intuition is that we use disjoint pairs $(A,B)$ such that $A \cup B$ is full ---with $(A,\neg{A})$ being the motivating example in the classical theory---, but we let the $\sigma$-algebra itself tell us which pairs those are.  Once we fix a particular measure, we may find additional pairs whose union is full, somewhat like finding additional measurable sets when taking the completion in the classical theory (although taking the completion is a separate phenomenon here), but that\'s all right; the important thing is that each pair chosen really is full in any measure used (much as each set in a classical $\sigma$-algebra must actually be measurable by any measure used).

See details at [[Cheng space]].

## Idea

The _mapping cone_ of a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in some [[homotopical category]] (precisely: a [[category of cofibrant objects]]) is, if it exists, a particular representative of the [[homotopy fiber|homotopy cofiber]] of $f$. 

It is also called the _homotopy [[cokernel]]_ of $f$ or the _[[weak quotient]]_ of $Y$ by the [[image]] of $X$ in $Y$ under $f$. 

The dual notion is that of [[mapping cocone]].

###### Remark

Intuitively this says that $cone(f)$ is the object obtained by

1. forming the cylinder over $X$;

1. gluing to one end of that the object $Y$ as specified by the map $f$.

1. shrinking the other end of the cylinder to the point.

Intuitively it is clear that this way every [[cycle]] in $Y$ that happens to be in the image of $X$ can be "continuously" translated in the cylinder-direction, keeping it constant in $Y$, to the other end of the cylinder, where it becomes the point. This means that every [[homotopy group]] of $Y$ in the image of $f$ vanishes in the mapping cone. Hence in the mapping cone **the image of $X$ under $f$ in $Y$ is removed up to homotopy**. This makes it clear how $cone(f)$ is a homotopy-version of the [[cokernel]] of $f$. And therefore the name "mapping cone".

     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{i_1}} & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{h}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore prop. \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma} says that 
the mapping cone is the the [[universal property|universal]] object with a morphism $i$ from $Y$ and a [[left homotopy]] from $i \circ f$ to the [[zero morphism]]. This is of course also precisely what def. \ref{InfinityCokernel} is saying.

###### Proposition

The colimit in prop. \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma} may be computed in two stages by two consecutive [[pushouts]] in $C$, and in two ways by the following [[pasting diagram]]:

$$
  \array{
    && X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{i_1} && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& cyl(X) &\to & cyl(f)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& cone(X) &\to& cone(f) 
  }
  \,.
$$

Here every square is a [[pushout]], (and so by the [[pasting law]] is every rectangular pasting composite).

=--

This now is a basic fact in ordinary [[category theory]]. The pushouts appearing here go by the following names:

+-- {: .num_defn #CylindersAndCones}
###### Definition

The pushout

$$
  \array{
     X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& cyl(X)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {*} &\to& cone(X)
  }
$$

defines the **[[cone]]** $cone(X)$ over $X$ (with respect to the chosen [[cylinder object]]): the result of taking the [[cylinder object|cylinder]] over $X$ and identifying one $X$-shaped end with the [[point]].

The pushout 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    cyl(X) &\to& cyl(f)
  }
$$

defines the **[[mapping cylinder]]** $cyl(f)$ of $f$, the result of identifying one end of the cylinder over $X$ with $Y$, using $f$ as the gluing map.

The pushout 

$$
  \array{
    cyl(X) &\to& cyl(f)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    cone(X) &\to& cone(f)
  }
$$

defines the **mapping cone** $cone(f)$ of $f$: the result of forming the cylinder over $X$ and then identifying one end with the point and the other with $Y$, via $f$.

=--

The geometric intuition behind this is best seen in the archetypical example of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]]. See the example _[For topological spaces](#ForTopologicalSpaces)_ below. The example _[For chain complexes](InChainComplexes)_ can be understood similarly geometrically by thinking of all chain complexes as [[singular chain complex|singular chains]] on topological spaces.


## Examples

We discuss realizations of the general construction in various contexts.
Some of these examples are regarded in parts of the literature as the default examples, notably that [for topological spaces](#ForTopologicalSpaces) and that [for chain complexes](#InChainComplexes).

### Suspension 

The mapping cone of the morphism $X \to {*}$ to the [[terminal object]] is the [[suspension object]] $\Sigma X$ of an object $X$. The dual notion of the [[loop space object]] of $X$.

### For topological spaces
 {#ForTopologicalSpaces}

The notion _mapping cone_  derives its name from its geometrical 
interpretation in the category [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]].

For more details see also at _[[topological cofiber sequence]]_.


With respect to the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]] every [[CW-complex]] is a cofibrant object, and hence mapping cones on maps between CW-complexes have intrinsic meaning in [[homotopy theory]].

Write $I \coloneqq [0,1] \subset \mathbb{R} \in $ [[Top]] for the [[closed interval]] with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]]. This is an [[interval object]] for the standard model structure. We may therefore take the [[cylinder object]] of a topological space $X$ to be 

$$ 
  cyl(X) \coloneqq X \times I
  \,,
$$

which is literally the cylinder over $X$. 

Given a [[continuous function]] $f:X\to Y$, the 
[[topological space]] $cone(f)$ is

$$
  cone(f) =  (X \times I) \cup_{f} Y
$$

This is the [[disjoint union]] of $X \times I$ with $Y$
followed by an identification under which for each 
$x\in X$ a point $(x,1) \in X \times I$ is identified with 
the point $f(x) \in Y$ and followed by the contraction of $X\times \{0\}$ to a point. 

Of course the opposite convention is also possible: identify $(x,0)$ with $f(x)$ for all $x$ and then contract $X\times\{1\}$ to a point; the two constructions of cones are canonically homeomorphic; the first is sometimes called the "inverse mapping cone".

The [[singular chain complex]] [[functor]] from [[Top]] to the 
[[category of chain complexes]] of [[abelian groups]] sends the mapping cone to a mapping cone in the sense of chain complexes (up to conventions on the orientation of the interval and vector order in the definition of mapping cone of chain complexes). 


### For chain complexes
 {#InChainComplexes}


Let $Ch_\bullet = Ch_\bullet(R Mod)$ be the [[category of chain complexes]] in $R$[[Mod]] for some [[ring]] $R$. 

(For instance if $R = \mathbb{Z}$ the [[integers]], then this is $Ch_\bullet(Ab)$, chain complexes of [[abelian groups]]. More generally $R Mod$ can be replaced by any [[abelian category]] in the following, with the evident changes in  the presentation here and there.)

We derive an explicit presentation of the mapping cone $cone(f)$ of a [[chain map]] $f$, according to the general definition \ref{CylindersAndCones}. The end result is prop. \ref{ComponentsOfMappingConeInChainComplexes} below,
reproducing the classical formula for the mapping cone.

It is in fact the [[normalized chain complex]] of [[chains on a simplicial set]] for the canonical simplicial interval, the 1-[[simplex]]:

  \,.

  (R_{(1)} \otimes X_n )

The [[colimits]] in a [[category of chain complexes]] $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ are computed in the underlying

There they are computed 
degreewise in $\mathcal{A}$
(see at [limits in presheaf categories](limits+and+colimits+by+example#limitsinpresheafcat)). 
Here the statement is evident:

the pushout identifies one [[direct sum|direct summand]] $X_n$
with $Y_n$ along $f_n$ and so where previously a $id_{X_n}$
appeared on the diagonl, there is now $f_n$.

The construction above builds the mapping cone explicitly via the standard formula for [[homotopy pushouts]]. Often however other presentations are more convenient:

For $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ a [[chain map]],

$D_{0,\bullet} \coloneqq Y_\bullet$ with 
$\partial_{0,\bullet} \coloneqq f_\bullet \colon D_{1,\bullet} \to D_{0,\bullet}$.

Then the [[total complex]] of $D_{\bullet, \bullet}$ is also
a model for the mapping cone of $f$:

$$

One checks by inspection that 
$tot(D_{\bullet,\bullet}) = Cone(\tilde f)$

for which there is a [[chain homotopy]] $f \Rightarrow f'$
(given only by multiplication by signs).

This appears for instance as ([Weibel, Exercise 1.2.8](#Weibel)).



### For cochain complexes
 {#InCochainComplexes}

We spell out the situation in more detail in a [[category of cochain complexes]].

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be some [[concrete category|concrete]] [[additive category]] and $Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ the [[category of chain complexes]] in $\mathcal{A}$. For

$$
  f : V^\bullet \to W^{\bullet}
$$

a morphism, the mapping cone is the complex

$$
  \begin{aligned}
   Cone(f) 
    & \coloneqq
  (\cdots \to Cone(f)^{k-1} \stackrel{d_{Cone(f)}}{\to} Cone(f)^k) \to \cdots)
   \\
   & \coloneqq
  \left(
    \array{
      \cdots \to & V^k &\stackrel{- d_V}{\to}& V^{k+1} & \to \cdots
      \\
      & \oplus &\searrow^{f^k}& \oplus
      \\
      \cdots \to & W^{k-1} &\underset{d_W}{\to}& W^k & \to \cdots
    }
  \right)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

There is a canonical co[[chain homotopy]]

$$
  \array{
    Cone(f) &\leftarrow& 0
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}\uparrow &\swArrow_{\eta}& \uparrow
    \\
    W &\stackrel{f}{\leftarrow}& V 
  }
$$

where $i : W \to Cone(f)$ is the canonical inclusion, componentwise given by

$$
  i^k : W^k \stackrel{(0,Id)}{\to} V_{k+1} \oplus W^k
$$

and where the cochain homotopy $\eta$ has components

$$
  \eta^k : V^k \stackrel{(Id,0)}{\to} Cone(f)^{k-1} = V^k \oplus W^{k-1}
$$ 

which we denote on $v \in V^k$ by

$$
  \eta : v \mapsto (f(v))[1] 
  \,.
$$

The fact that this is a cochain homotopy means that

$$
  [d,\eta] = i \circ f - 0
  \,,
$$

which we check on any $v \in V^k$ by computing

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    [d, \eta](v) &= 
    d_{Cone(f)} \circ \eta (v) 
    + \eta(d_V v)
    \\
    & = d_{Cone(f)} (f(v)[1]) + (f(d_V v))[1]
    \\
    & =
    \left( 
      f(v)
      - 
      (d_{W}f(v))[1]
    \right)
    +
    (d_W (f(v)))[1]
    \\
    & = f(v)
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where we used the above definition of $d_{Cone(f)}$ and the fact that $f$ is a chain homomorphism and hence intertwines the differentials.

This cochain homotopy is universal in that 
for any other cochain homotopy

$$
  \array{
    X &\leftarrow& 0
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{j}}\uparrow &\swArrow_{\rho}& \uparrow
    \\
    W &\stackrel{f}{\leftarrow}& V 
  }
$$

hence

$$
  j \circ f = [d,\rho]
$$

we have a morphism

$$
  (j,\rho) :  Cone(f) \to X
$$

given on $W$ by $j$ and on $V$ by $\rho$

$$
  (j,\rho)^k : V^{k+1} \oplus W^k \stackrel{(\rho, j)}{\to} X^k
$$

which is indeed a cochain homomorphism because for all $v + w \in Cone(f)$ we have 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d_X (j,\rho)(v + w) 
     & = 
    d_X (\rho v) +  d_X (j(w))
     \\
     & = [d,\rho](v) - \rho d_V v + j (d_W w)
     \\
     & = j f (v) - \rho d_V v + j (d_{Cone(f)} w)
     \\
     & = (j,\rho) d_{Cone(f)}(v + w)
  \end{aligned}
$$

and which is unique with the property that [[whiskering]] of [[2-morphism]]s gives

$$
  \array{
    X &\leftarrow& 0
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{j}}\uparrow &\swArrow_{\rho}& \uparrow
    \\
    W &\stackrel{f}{\leftarrow}& V 
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;
   =
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    X
    \\
    & \nwarrow^{\mathrlap{(j,\rho)}}
    \\
    &&  Cone(f) &\leftarrow& 0
    \\
    && {}^{\mathllap{i}}\uparrow &\swArrow_{\eta}& \uparrow
    \\
    && W &\stackrel{f}{\leftarrow}& V 
  }  
$$

hence that

$$
  j = (j,\rho) \circ i
$$

and

$$
  \rho = (j,\rho) \circ \eta
  \,.
$$


### In additive categories with translation


Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[additive category]] [[category with translation|with translation]] $T=[1] : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two [[differential objects]] in $(\mathcal{A},T)$ and $f : X \to Y$ any [[morphism]] in $C$. 

The **mapping cone** $Cone(f)$ of $f$ is the [[differential object]] whose underlying object is the [[direct sum]] $T X \oplus Y$ and whose differential $d_{cone f} : T X \oplus X \to T T X \oplus T X$ is given in [[matrix calculus]] notation by

$$
  d_{cone f} :=
  \left(
   \array{
    d_{T X} & 0
    \\
    T(f) & d_Y
   }
  \right)
  =
  \left(
   \array{
    - T(d_X) & 0
    \\
    T(f) & d_Y
   }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Notice the minus sign here, coming from the definition of a [[differential object|shifted differential object]].

### Homology exact sequences and fiber sequences
 {#HomologyExactSequencesAndFiberSequences}

We discuss the relation between mapping cones 
in [[categories of chain complexes]], as [above](#InChainComplexes), 
and  [[long exact sequences in homology]]. For an exposition of the following see there the section _[Relation to homotopy fiber sequences](long+exact+sequence+in+homology#RelationToHomotopyFiberSequences)_.

Let $f : X_\bullet \longrightarrow Y_\bullet$ be a [[chain map]]
and write $cone(f) \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$
for its mapping cone
as explicitly given in prop. \ref{ComponentsOfMappingConeInChainComplexes}.

for the [[chain map]] which in components 

$$
  p_n : cone(f)_n \to X[1]_n
$$

is given, via prop. \ref{ComponentsOfMappingConeInChainComplexes}, 
by the canonical projection out of a direct sum

The chain map $p : cone(f)_\bullet \to X[1]_\bullet$
represents the [[homotopy cofiber]] of the

$i : Y_\bullet \to cone(f)_\bullet$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{InclusionIntoChainComplexCone} and 
def. \ref{ProjectionOutOfChainComplexMappingCone} the sequence

$$
  Y_\bullet 
    \stackrel{i}{\to}
  cone(f)_\bullet
    \stackrel{p}{\to}
  X[1]_\bullet
$$

is a [[short exact sequence]] of chain complexes (since it is so degreewise, in fact degreewise it is even a [[split exact sequence]]). In particular we have a [[cofiber]] [[pushout]] diagram

$$
  \array{
     Y_\bullet &\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow}& cone(f)_\bullet
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     0 &\to& X[1]_\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

Now, in the [[injective model structure on chain complexes]] all chain complxes are [[cofibrant objects]] and an inclusion such as $i : Y_\bullet \hookrightarrow cone(f)_\bullet$ is a [[cofibration]]. By the detailed discussion at [[homotopy limit]] this means that the ordinary colimit here is in fact a [[homotopy colimit]], hence exhibits $p$ as the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $i$.

In order to compare this to the discussion of [[nLab:connecting homomorphisms]], we now turn attention to the case that $f_\bullet$ happens to be a [[monomorphism]]. Notice that this we can always assume, up to [[quasi-isomorphism]], for instance by prolonging $f$ by the map into its [[mapping cylinder]]

$$
  X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} cyl(f) 
  \,.
$$

By the axioms on an [[abelian category]] in this case we have a [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to X_\bullet \stackrel{f_\bullet}{\to} Y_\bullet \stackrel{p_\bullet}{\to} Z_\bullet \to 0
$$

of chain complexes. The following discussion revolves around the fact that now $cone(f)_\bullet$ as well as $Z_\bullet$ are both models for the homotopy cofiber of $f$.



+-- {: .num_lemma #ConeInjectionEquivalentToZigzag}
###### Lemma

Let 
$$
  X_\bullet \stackrel{f_\bullet}{\to} Y_\bullet \stackrel{p_\bullet}{\to} Z_\bullet
$$

be a [[short exact sequence]] of [[chain complexes]]. 


The collection of linear maps

$$
  h_n : Y_n \oplus X_{n-1} \to Y_n \stackrel{}{\to} Z_n
$$

constitutes a [[chain map]]

$$
  h_\bullet : cone(f)_\bullet \to Z_\bullet
  \,.
$$


This is a [[quasi-isomorphism]]. The inverse of $H_n(h_\bullet)$ is given by sending a representing [[cycle]] $z \in Z_n$ to 

$$
  (\hat z_n, \partial^Y \hat z_n) \in Y_n \oplus X_{n+1}
  \,,
$$

where $\hat z_n$ is any choice of lift through $p_n$ and where $\partial^Y \hat z_n$ is the formula expressing the [[connecting homomorphism]] in terms of elements, as discussed at [Connecting homomorphism -- In terms of elements](connecting%20homomorphism#OnHomologyInTermsOfElements).
 
Finally, the morphism $i_\bullet : Y_\bullet \to cone(f)_\bullet$ is eqivalent in the [[homotopy category]] (the [[derived category]]) to the [[zigzag]]

$$
  \array{
    && cone(f)_\bullet 
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    Y_\bullet &\to& Z_\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

In the literature this appears for instance as ([Schapira, cor. 7.2.2](#Schapira)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that $h_\bullet$ defines a chain map recall the differential $\partial^{cone(f)}$ from prop. \ref{ComponentsOfMappingConeInChainComplexes}, which acts by

$$
  \partial^{cone(f)} (x_{n-1}, \hat z_n)
  = 
  (  -\partial^X x_{n-1} , \partial^Y \hat z_n + x_{n-1} )
$$

and use that $x_{n-1}$ is in the [[kernel]] of $p_n$ by exactness, hence

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    h_{n-1}\partial^{cone(f)}(x_{n-1}, \hat z_n)
    &= 
    h_{n-1}( -\partial^X x_{n-1}, \partial^Y \hat z_n + x_{n-1}  )
    \\
    & = p_{n-1}( \partial^Y \hat z_n + x_{n-1})
    \\
    & = p_{n-1}( \partial^Y \hat z_n )
    \\
    & = \partial^Z p_n \hat z_n
    \\
    & = \partial^Z h_n(x_{n-1}, \hat z_n)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

It is immediate to see that we have a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && cone(f)_\bullet 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{i_\bullet}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    Y_\bullet &\to& Z_\bullet
  }
$$

since the composite morphism is the inclusion of $Y$ followed by the bottom morphism on $Y$. 

Abstractly, this already implies that $cone(f)_\bullet \to Z_\bullet$ is a [[quasi-isomorphism]], 
for this diagram gives a morphism of [[cocones]] under the diagram defining $cone(f)$ in prop. \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma} and by the above both of these cocones are [[homotopy colimit|homotopy-colimiting]].

But in checking the claimed inverse of the induced map on homology groups, we verify this also explicity:

We first determine those cycles $(x_{n-1}, y_n) \in cone(f)_n$ which lift a cycle $z_n$. By lemma \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma}
a lift of chains is any pair of the form $(x_{n-1}, \hat z_n)$ where $\hat z_n$ is a lift of $z_n$ through $Y_n \to X_n$. So $x_{n-1}$ has to be found such that this pair is a cycle.
By prop. \ref{ComponentsOfMappingConeInChainComplexes} the differential acts on it by

$$
  \partial^{cone(f)} (x_{n-1}, \hat z_n)
  = 
  (  -\partial^X x_{n-1} , \partial^Y \hat z_n + x_{n-1} )
$$

and so the condition is that 

$x_{n-1} \coloneqq -\partial^Y \hat z_n$ (which implies $\partial^X x_{n-1} = -\partial^X \partial^Y \hat z_n = -\partial^Y \partial^Y \hat z_n = 0$ due to the fact that $f_n$ is assumed to be an inclusion, hence that $\partial^X$ is the restriction of $\partial^Y$ to elements in $X_n$).

This condition clearly has a unique solution for every lift $\hat z_n$ and a lift $\hat z_n$ always exists since $p_n : Y_n \to Z_n$ is surjective, by assumption that we have a [[short exact sequence]] of chain complexes. This shows that $H_n(h_\bullet)$ is surjective.

To see that it is also injective we need to show that 
if a [[cycle]] $(-\partial^Y \hat z_n, \hat z_n) \in cone(f)_n$ maps to a cycle $z_n = p_n(\hat z_n)$ that is trivial in $H_n(Z)$ in that there is $c_{n+1}$ with $\partial^Z c_{n+1} = z_n$, then also the original cycle was trivial in homology, in that there is $(x_n, y_{n+1})$ with

$$
  \partial^{cone(f)}(x_n, y_{n+1})
  \coloneqq
  (-\partial^X x_n, \partial^Y y_{n+1} + x_n)
  =
  (-\partial^Y \hat z_n, \hat z_n)
  \,.
$$

For that let $\hat c_{n+1} \in Y_{n+1}$ be a lift of $c_{n+1}$ through $p_n$, which exists again by surjectivity of $p_{n+1}$. Observe that

$$
  p_{n}( \hat z_n -  \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1})
  = 
  z_n -\partial^Z ( p_n \hat c_{n+1} )
  = 
  z_n - \partial^Z ( c_{n+1} ) 
  = 
  0
$$

by assumption on $z_n$ and $c_{n+1}$,
and hence that $\hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1}$ is in $X_n$ by exactness.

Hence 
$(z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1}, \hat c_{n+1}) \in cone(f)_n$
trivializes the given cocycle:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial^{cone(f)}( \hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1}  , \hat c_{n+1})
    & = 
   (-\partial^X(\hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1} ), \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1} + (\hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1} ) )
    \\
    & = (-\partial^Y(\hat z_n - \partial^Y \hat c_{n+1}),  \hat z_n )
    \\
    & =
    ( -\partial^Y \hat z_n, \hat z_n )
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

###### Theorem

Let 
$$
  X_\bullet \stackrel{f_\bullet}{\to} Y_\bullet \to Z_\bullet
$$

be a [[short exact sequence]] of [[chain complexes]]. 

Then the  [[chain homology]] functor

$$
  H_n(-) : Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \to \mathcal{A}
$$

sends the homotopy cofiber sequence of $f$, cor. \ref{HomotopyCofiberSequenceOfChainMap}, to the 
[[long exact sequence in homology]] induced by the given short
exact sequence, hence to

$$
  H_n(X_\bullet)
  \to
  H_n(Y_\bullet)
   \to 
  H_n(Z_\bullet)
   \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  H_{n-1}(X_\bullet)
   \to 
  H_{n-1}(Y_\bullet)
   \to 
  H_{n-1}(Z_\bullet)
   \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  H_{n-2}(X_\bullet)
   \to \cdots
  \,,
$$

where $\delta_n$ is the $n$th [[connecting homomorphism]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{ConeInjectionEquivalentToZigzag} the 
homotopy cofiber sequence is equivalen to the [[zigzag]]

$$
  \array{
     && && && && && cone(f)[1]_\bullet &\to& \cdots
     \\
     && && && && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h[1]_\bullet}}_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     && && cone(f)_\bullet &\to& X[1]_\bullet &\stackrel{f[1]_\bullet}{\to}& Y[1]_\bullet &\to& Z[1]_\bullet
     \\
     && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_\bullet}}_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     X_\bullet 
       &\stackrel{f_\bullet}{\to}&
     Y_\bullet
       &\stackrel{}{\to}&
     Z_\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

Observe that 

$$
  H_n( X[k]_\bullet) \simeq H_{n-k}(X_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

It is therefore sufficient to check that 

$$
  H_n
  \left(
    \array{
      cone(f)_\bullet &\to& X[1]_\bullet
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
      \\
      Z_\bullet
    }
  \right)
  \;\;
   : 
  \;\;
  H_n(Z_\bullet) \to H_n(cone(f)_\bullet) \to H_{n-1}(X_\bullet)
$$

equals the [[connecting homomorphism]] $\delta_n$ induced by the short exact sequence.

By prop. \ref{ConeInjectionEquivalentToZigzag} the inverse of the vertical map is given by choosing lifts and forming the corresponding element given by the connecting homomorphism.
By prop. \ref{ProjectionOutOfChainComplexMappingConeIsHoCofiber} the horizontal map is just the projection, and hence the assignment is of the form

$$
  [z_n] \mapsto [x_{n-1}, y_n] \mapsto [x_{n-1}]
  \,.
$$

So in total the image of the zig-zag under homology sends

$$
  [z_n]_Z \mapsto -[\partial^Y \hat z_n]_X
  \,.
$$

By the discussion [there](connecting%20homomorphism#OnHomologyInTermsOfElements), this is indeed the action of the [[connecting homomorphism]].

### Distinguished triangles from mapping cones 
 {#DistinguishedTriangles}

In summary, the [above](#HomologyExactSequencesAndFiberSequences) says that for every [[chain map]] $f_\bullet : X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ we obtain maps

$$
  X_\bullet \stackrel{f}{\to}
  Y_\bullet
  \stackrel{
    \left(
      \array{
          0 
          \\
          id_{Y_\bullet}
      }
    \right)
  }{\to}
   cone(f)_\bullet
  \stackrel{
    \left(
      \array{
         id_{X[1]_\bullet} & 0
      }
    \right)
  }{\to}
  X[1]_\bullet
$$

which form a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] and such that this sequence continues by forming [[suspension of a chain complex|suspensions]], hence for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ we have

$$
  X[n]_\bullet \stackrel{f}{\to}
  Y[n]_\bullet
  \stackrel{
    \left(
      \array{
          0 
          \\
          id_{Y[n]_\bullet}
      }
    \right)
  }{\to}
   cone(f)[n]_\bullet
  \stackrel{
    \left(
      \array{
         id_{X[n+11]_\bullet} & 0
      }
    \right)
  }{\to}
  X[n+1]_\bullet
$$

To amplify this quasi-cyclic behaviour one sometimes depicts the situation as follows:

$$
  \array{
     X_\bullet &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& Y_\bullet
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{[1]}}\nwarrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && cone(f)_\bullet
  }
$$

and hence speaks of a "triangle", or **distinguished triangle** or **mapping cone triangle** of $f$. 

* distinguished triangle = period of [[homotopy fiber sequence]] .

Due to these "triangles" one calls the [[homotopy category]] of chain complexes [[localization|localized]] at the [[quasi-isomorphisms]], hence the  [[derived category]], a **[[triangulated category]]**.

Notice that equivalently we can express the triangles via the 
[[mapping cylinder]].
For every map of [[chain complex]]es $f:A\to B$, the cylinder $Cyl(f)$ is quasi-isomorphic to $B$, and moreover in the [[homotopy category]] of chain complexes, every distinguished triangle is quasi-isomorphic to a distinguished triangle of the form 

$$ A\to Cyl(u)\to Cone(u)\to A[1]$$

for some $u:A\to B$ where all the morphisms in the triangle are appropriatedly induced by $u$.

# Totally bounded spaces
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

A [[topological space]] is _totally bounded_ if it may be [[covering|covered]] by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size.

The [[Heine-Borel theorem]], which states that a [[closed subset|closed]] and [[bounded subset|bounded]] [[subset]] of the [[real line]] is [[compact space|compact]] (in the finite open subcover sense), applies to all [[Euclidean spaces]] but not to general [[metric spaces]].  However, if we use two facts about the real line (which hold for all cartesian spaces) ---that a subset is [[closed subspace|closed]] if and only if it is [[complete space|complete]] and that a subset is [[bounded space|bounded]] if and only if it is _totally bounded_---, then we get a theorem that *does* apply to all metric spaces (at least assuming the [[axiom of choice]]): that a complete and totally bounded space is compact.

The concept (and the Heine--Borel theorem, in this sense) apply not only to metric spaces but to [[uniform spaces]]; like completeness, total boundedness is a uniform property.


## Definition

### Basic definitions

In the following definitions, '[[finite set|finite]]' means Kuratowski-finite, or finitely indexed, for the purposes of [[constructive mathematics]].  All of these definitions are constructively equivalent.

The slickest definition for [[uniform spaces]] is probably this one:

+-- {: .num_defn #slick}
###### Definition

A uniform space $X$ is __totally bounded__ if every [[uniform cover]] of $X$ has a finite subcover.
=--

Since uniform covers are not a common approach to uniform spaces, we unwrap the definition of uniform covers in terms of entouranges to get this definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #uniform}
###### Definition

A uniform space $X$ is __totally bounded__ if, for every [[entourage]] $U$ of $X$, there is a finite [[open cover]] $\mathcal{C}$ of $X$ such that every set $G$ in $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $G \times G \subseteq U$.
=--

In fact, it is enough to consider only basic entourages for some [[base]] of the uniformity.  Thus, we may specialise to [[gauge spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #gauge}
###### Definition

A gauge space $X$ is __totally bounded__ if, for every gauging distance $d$ of $X$, there is a finite open cover $\mathcal{C}$ of $X$ such that every set in $\mathcal{C}$ has $d$-diameter less than $1$.
=--

In fact, it is enough to consider only basic gauging distances for some base of the gauge, or even for some [[subbase]] of the gauge if we make the requirement for arbitrarily small diameters (rather than the fixed diameter $1$ as above).  Thus, we may specialise to [[metric spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #metric}
###### Definition

A metric space $X$ is __totally bounded__ if, for every positive number $\epsilon$, there is a finite open cover $\mathcal{C}$ of $X$ such that every set in $\mathcal{C}$ has diameter less than $\epsilon$.
=--

### Proximity spaces

The category of totally bounded uniform spaces and uniformly continuous functions is equivalent to the category of [[proximity spaces]] and proximally continuous functions.  Thus, proximity spaces can be considered yet another axiomatization of "totally bounded space" that doesn't rely on a pre-existing kind of "space".



## Properties

All of these results hold constructively unless otherwise noted.

Every [[compact space]] is totally bounded; this is immediate from Definition \ref{slick}, since every uniform cover is an open cover.  Conversely, if one assumes the [[ultrafilter principle]], then every [[complete space|complete]] and totally bounded space is compact.  In [[constructive mathematics]], "complete and totally bounded" is sometimes taken as a definition of "compact" -- see [[Bishop-compact space]].

Any [[product]] of totally bounded spaces is totally bounded.  The totally bounded subspaces of a given space $X$ form an [[ideal]] in the [[power set]] of $X$.

A [[subspace]] of a [[Cartesian space]] is totally bounded if and only if it is [[bounded space|bounded]].  Every totally bounded metric space is [[separable space|separable]].

### Relation to precompact spaces

Every [[precompact space|precompact]] [[uniform space]] is totally bounded; using Definition \ref{slick}, this may be proved by checking that any uniform cover of $X$ generates a uniform cover of $\overline{X}$. The converse, that every totally bounded space is precompact, is equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]]. Of course, many totally bounded spaces may be proved precompact on weaker assumptions; in particular, that a bounded subset of a cartesian space is precompact is equivalent to the [[fan theorem]] (and so also follows from the principle of [[excluded middle]]), a fact related to the [[Heine–Borel theorem]].

If $A = (a_{i j})$ is a [[matrix]] with [[coefficients]] in a [[star algebra]] (such as the [[complex numbers]] under [[complex conjugation]]), then its _conjugate transpose_ $A^\dagger$ is the matrix $A^\dagger \coloneqq (a^\ast_{j i})$, hence the composite of passing to the [[transpose matrix]] and applying the star-operation

$$
  A^\dagger \coloneqq \left(A^t\right)^\ast = \left(A^\ast\right)^t
$$

Identifying matrices with [[linear maps]] and with respect to the standard [[inner product]] this operation represents passing to the [[adjoint operator]]. Therefore one speaks also of _adjoint matrices_.

## Definition
 {#Definition}



The following definition of the degree of a polynomial is formulated vis the *formal [[derivative]]* or *left shift* of a polynomial. 

The idea behind this lies in the traditional conception of polynomials as [[sums]] of [[monomials]], namely of [[multiplication|products]] of non-zero [[scalars]] with powers of an "indeterminate" -- which have an associated exponent because commutative rings are [[power-associative]] in [[multiplication]]. 

Both the derivative and the left shift are functions on polynomials which reduce the exponent of the associated indeterminate by one and take polynomials, relative to the given indeterminate, to zero. Since both operations are also [[linear functions]], they act this way on each monomial summand, which means that after repeatedly taking derivatives or left shifts of polynomials, the result  will eventually become [[zero]]. 

This allows us to define the degree of a polynomial using [[induction]] on the [[natural numbers]] and on [[lists]] of natural numbers, as well as [[composition]] of left shifts, without having to write out long formulae using indices and ellipses everywhere in the definition, and without having to include additional structure with each polynomial $p$ in the form of the [[scalar]] [[coefficients]] of $p$.

### Polynomials in one indeterminate

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, the commutative ring of [[polynomials]] $R[x]$ in one indeterminate $x$ is the [[initial object|initial]] commutative ring $R[x]$ with an element $x \in R[x]$ and a [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[x]$. 

#### Using derivatives

The **formal derivative** $\frac{d (-)}{d x}:R[x] \to R[x]$ is a function which is inductively defined on $R[x]$ by

* Constants go to zero: $\frac{d h(r)}{d x} = 0$ for all $r \in R$
* Indeterminate goes to one: $\frac{d x}{d x} = h(1)$
* Addition preservation: $\frac{d (p + q)}{d x} = \frac{d p}{d x} + \frac{d q}{d x}$ for all $p \in R[x]$ and $q \in R[x]$. 
* Leibniz rule: $\frac{d (p \cdot q)}{d x} = \frac{d q}{d x} \cdot q + p \cdot \frac{d q}{d x}$ for all $p \in R[x]$ and $q \in R[x]$. 

By the universal property of $R[x]$, these constructors are enough to define the derivative on all polynomials $p \in R[x]$. 

Let $\frac{d^{(-)} (-)}{d x^{(-)}}:\mathbb{N} \to (R[X] \to R[X])$ be the function which takes a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ to the $n$-th derivative in the [[function set]] $R[X] \to R[X]$. This is inductively defined on the natural numbers by

* $\frac{d^{0} (-)}{d x^{0}} = \mathrm{id}_{R[X]}$
* $\frac{d^{s(n)} (-)}{d x^{s(n)}} = \frac{d (-)}{d x} \circ \frac{d^{n} (-)}{d x^{n}}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

If $R$ has [[characteristic zero]], given a non-zero polynomial $p \in R[x]$, the **degree** of $p$ is the maximum [[natural number]] $n$ where the $n$-th iteration of the formal [[derivative]] of $p$ is non-zero:
$$\mathrm{deg}(p) \coloneqq \max_{n \in \mathbb{N}, \frac{d^{n} p}{d x^{n}} \neq 0}(n)$$

The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined, since the formal derivative of the zero polynomial is never non-zero. 

The above definition involving formal derivatives works for commutative rings $R$ with [[characteristic zero]]. However, if $R$ has [[positive characteristic]], the formal derivative is problematic for the degree, because given characteristic $n$, the derivative of the $n$-th power of the indeterminate $x$ is zero. Instead, we have to use something more general, the left shift. 

#### Using left shifts

For every polynomial $p \in R[x]$, $p$ could be represented as the sum of a constant polynomial $c_p$ and the product of the indeterminate $x$ and a polynomial $s_L(p)$ called the **left shift** of $p$: $p = c_p + x \cdot s_L(p)$. Given any two constant polynomials $p = c_p$ and $q = c_q$, by definition, $c_{p \cdot q} = c_p \cdot c_q$. Now, given any two general polynomials $p = c_p + x \cdot s_L(p)$ and $q = c_q + x \cdot s_L(q)$, one then has the following, through the axioms of a [[commutative ring]]:
$$p = x \cdot s_L(p) + c_p, q = x \cdot s_L(q) + c_q$$
$$p \cdot q = x \cdot s_L(p \cdot q) + c_{p \cdot q} = x s_L(p \cdot q) + c_{p} \cdot c_{q}$$
$$p \cdot q = (x \cdot s_L(p) + c_p) \cdot (x \cdot  s_L(q) + c_q) = x^2 \cdot s_L(p) \cdot s_L(q) + x \cdot s_L(p) \cdot c_q + x \cdot s_L(q) \cdot c_p + c_p \cdot c_q$$
$$x \cdot s_L(p \cdot q) = x^2 \cdot s_L(p) \cdot s_L(q) + x \cdot s_L(p) \cdot c_q + x \cdot s_L(q) \cdot c_p$$
$$s_L(p \cdot q) = x \cdot s_L(p) \cdot s_L(q) + s_L(p) \cdot c_q + s_L(q) \cdot c_p$$
$$p - x \cdot s_L(p) = c_p, q - x \cdot s_L(q) = c_q$$
$$s_L(p \cdot q) = x \cdot s_L(p) \cdot s_L(q) + s_L(p) \cdot (q - x \cdot s_L(q)) + s_L(q) \cdot (p - x \cdot  s_L(p)) = s_L(p) \cdot q + s_L(q) \cdot p - x \cdot s_L(p) \cdot s_L(q)$$
Thus, we have the formula for the left shift of the product $p \cdot q$ for any two polynomials $p \in R[x]$ and $q \in R[x]$: 
$$s_L(p \cdot q) = s_L(p) \cdot q + p \cdot s_L(q) - x \cdot s_L(p) \cdot s_L(q)$$
The only difference from the [[Leibniz rule]] for the formal [[derivative]] is the extra term $-x \cdot s_L(p) \cdot s_L(q)$ at the end of the formula. 

This allows us to inductively define on $R[x]$ the formal left shift operator $s_L:R[x] \to R[x]$ in the same manner as the formal derivative, by

* Constants go to zero: $s_L(h(r)) = 0$ for all $r \in R$
* Indeterminate goes to one: $s_L(x) = h(1)$
* Addition preservation: $s_L(p + q) = s_L(p) + s_L(q)$ for all $p:R[x]$ and $q:R[x]$. 
* Left shift product rule: $s_L(p \cdot q) = s_L(p) \cdot q + p \cdot s_L(q) - x \cdot s_L(p) \cdot s_L(q)$ for all $p \in R[x]$ and $q \in R[x]$. 

By the universal property of $R[x]$, these constructors are enough to define the left shift on all polynomials $p \in R[x]$. 

Let $s_L^n:\mathbb{N} \to (R[X] \to R[X])$ be the function which takes a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ to the $n$-th left shift in the [[function set]] $R[X] \to R[X]$. This is inductively defined on the natural numbers by the following constructors

* $s_L^0 = \mathrm{id}_{R[X]}$
* $s_L^{s(n)} = s_L \circ s_L^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

In this defintion, $R$ is not required to have [[characteristic zero]]. Given a non-zero polynomial $p \in R[x]$, the **degree** of $p$ is the [[maximum]] [[natural number]] $n$ where the $n$-th iteration of the formal left shift operator of $p$ is non-zero:
$$\mathrm{deg}(p) \coloneqq \max_{n \in \mathbb{N}, s_L^n(p) \neq 0}(n)$$

The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined, since the left shift of the zero polynomial is never non-zero. 

### Polynomials in a finite number of indeterminates

Let us define the standard [[finite set]] $\mathrm{Fin}(n)$ as the set of all [[natural numbers]] less than $n$:

$$\mathrm{Fin}(n) \coloneqq \{i \in \mathbb{N} \vert i \lt n\}$$

Given a natural number less than $n$, $i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)$, let $\mathrm{Fin}(n) \setminus \{i\}$ be the set of natural numbers less than $n$ which are not equal to $i$. 

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$ with [[characteristic zero]] and a natural number $n$, the commutative ring of [[polynomials]] $R[X]$ is the [[initial object|initial]] [[commutative ring]] $R[X]$ with a function $X:\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to R[X]$ and a [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[X]$. We write $X_i$ for $X(i)$ throughout. Given a natural number less than $n$, $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$, let $R[X \setminus \{X_i\}]$ be the polynomial [[subring]] of $R[X]$ whose indeterminates do not include $X_i$, with monomorphism $m:R[X \setminus \{X_i\}] \hookrightarrow R[X]$. 

Let $\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ be the [[free monoid]] on the set of natural numbers less than $n$. Every [[free monoid]] $\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ has a length function $\mathrm{len}:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^* \to \mathbb{N}$ which returns the number of elements in a list $a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$, inductively defined by the following constructors

* Monoidal unit preservation: $\mathrm{len}(\epsilon) = 0$
* Monoidal product preservation: $\mathrm{len}(a b) = \mathrm{len}(a) + \mathrm{len}(b)$ for all $a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ and $b \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$
* Generators have length 1: $\mathrm{len}(i) = 1$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$

#### With partial derivatives

The **formal partial derivative** $\frac{\partial(-)}{\partial X_{(-)}}:\mathrm{Fin}(n) \times R[X] \to R[X]$ is inductively defined by 

* Constants relative to the indeterminant go to zero: $\frac{\partial h(r)}{\partial X_i} = 0$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$ and $r \in R[X \setminus \{X_i\}]$
* Indeterminates go to one: $\frac{\partial X_i}{\partial X_i} = 1$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$
* Addition preservation: $\frac{\partial (P + Q)}{\partial X_i} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial X_i} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial X_i}$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$, $P \in R[X]$ and $Q \in R[X]$. 
* Leibniz rule: $\frac{\partial (P \cdot Q)}{\partial X_i} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial X_i} \cdot Q + P \cdot \frac{\partial Q}{\partial X_i}$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$, $P \in R[X]$ and $Q \in R[X]$. 

By the universal property of $R[X]$, these constructors are enough to define the partial derivatives on all polynomials $P \in R[X]$. 

Let $d:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^* \to (R[X] \to R[X])$ be the [[monoid homomorphism]] which takes a list $a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ of natural numbers less than $n$, to the composition of formal partial derivatives 
$$d(a) \coloneqq \frac{\partial^{\mathrm{len}(a)} (-)}{\partial X_{a_0} \partial X_{a_1} \partial X_{a_2} \ldots} \coloneqq \frac{\partial (-)}{\partial X_{a_0}} \circ \frac{\partial (-)}{\partial X_{a_1}} \circ \frac{\partial (-)}{\partial X_{a_2}} \circ \ldots$$ 
in the [[function set]] $R[X] \to R[X]$. This is inductively defined by the following constructors

* Monoidal unit preservation: $d(\epsilon) = \mathrm{id}_{R[X]}$
* Monoidal product preservation: $d(a b) = d(a) \circ d(b)$ for all $a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ and $b \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$
* Generators to partial derivatives: $d(i) = \frac{\partial (-)}{\partial X_i}$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$

If $R$ has [[characteristic zero]], given a non-zero polynomial $P \in R[x]$, the **degree** of $P$ is the maximum length of all lists $a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ of natural numbers less than $n$ such that the evaluation of $d(a)$ at $P$ is non-zero
$$\mathrm{deg}(P) \coloneqq \max_{a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*, d(a)(P) \neq 0}(\mathrm{len}(a))$$ 
The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined, since any composition of partial derivatives evaluated at the zero polynomial is never non-zero. 

The above definition involving formal partial derivatives works for commutative rings $R$ with [[characteristic zero]]. However, if $R$ has [[positive characteristic]], the formal derivative is problematic for the degree, because given characteristic $p$, the derivative of the $p$-th power of any indeterminate $X_i$ for natural number less than $n$, $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$, is zero. Instead, we have to use something more general, partial left shifts. 

#### With partial left shifts

The **formal partial left shift operator** $s_{\partial L}:\mathrm{Fin}(n) \times R[X] \to R[X]$ is inductively defined by 

* Constants relative to the indeterminant go to zero: $s_{\partial L}(i, r) = 0$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$ and $r \in R[X \setminus \{X_i\}]$
* Indeterminates go to one: $s_{\partial L}(i, X_i) = 1$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$
* Addition preservation: $s_{\partial L}(i, P + Q) = s_{\partial L}(i, P) + s_{\partial L}(i, Q)$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$, $P \in R[X]$ and $Q \in R[X]$. 
* Left shift product rule: $s_{\partial L}(i, P \cdot Q) = s_{\partial L}(i, P) \cdot Q + P \cdot s_{\partial L}(i, Q) - X_i \cdot s_{\partial L}(i, P) \cdot s_{\partial L}(i, Q)$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$, $p \in R[x]$ and $q \in R[x]$. 

By the universal property of $R[X]$, these constructors are enough to define the partial left shifts on all polynomials $P \in R[X]$. 

Let $S:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^* \to (R[X] \to R[X])$ be the [[monoid homomorphism]] which takes a list $a\in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ of natural numbers less than $n$, to the composition of formal partial left shifts 
$$S(a) \coloneqq s_{\partial L}(a_0, -) \circ s_{\partial L}(a_1, -) \circ s_{\partial L}(a_2, -) \circ \ldots$$ 
in the [[function set]] $R[X] \to R[X]$. This is inductively defined by the following constructors

* Monoidal unit preservation: $S(\epsilon) = \mathrm{id}_{R[X]}$
* Monoidal product preservation: $S(a b) = S(a) \circ S(b)$ for all $a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ and $b \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$
* Generators to partial left shifts $S(i) = s_{\partial L}(i, -)$ for all $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$

Given a non-zero polynomial $P \in R[x]$, the **degree** of $P$ is the maximum length of all lists $a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ of natural numbers less than $n$ such that the evaluation of $S(a)$ at $P$ is non-zero
$$\mathrm{deg}(P) \coloneqq \max_{a \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)^*, S(a)(P) \neq 0}(\mathrm{len}(a))$$ 
The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined, since any composition of partial derivatives evaluated at the zero polynomial is never non-zero. 

## Homogeneous polynomials

...

Given a polynomial $p \in R[x]$ in one indeterminate, it is said to be an **homogeneous polynomial** of degree $n$ if $\frac{d p}{d x}.x = n.p$ (see the [[homogeneous polynomial|Euler identity]]).

Given a polynomial $p \in R[X]$ in a finite number of indeterminates, it is said to be an homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ if $\underset{i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)}{\sum} \frac{\partial p}{\partial X_i}.X_i = n.p$.

One could also define a polynomial $p \in R[X]$ to be homogeneous of degree $n$ with respect to $i \in \mathrm{Fin}(n)$ if $\frac{\partial p}{\partial X_i}.X_i = n.p$. It is equivalent to the fact that $p$ can be written under the form $p=X_i^{n}.q$ where $q \in R[X]$ is such that $\frac{\partial p}{\partial X_i} = 0$.

## In constructive mathematics

In [[constructive mathematics]], where [[excluded middle]] does not hold, the above definition is correct only if the ring $R$ has [[decidable equality]]. In more general circumstances, one has to assume that the ring $R$ and thus the polynomial ring $R[X]$ is an [[inequality space]] with a [[tight apartness relation]] $\#$, and replace all instances of "non-zero" $p \neq 0$ with instances of "apart from zero" $p \# 0$. (That every set $R$ is an inequality space in classical mathematics follows from the [[stable equality|stability]] of decidable equality.) For example, the degree function on the [[Dedekind real numbers]] is only defined on polynomials with at least one coefficient whose [[absolute value]] is greater than zero.

An __inner automorphism__ $\phi:G\to G$ of a group $G$ is any [[automorphism]] $\phi_g$ of the form $h\mapsto g h g^{-1}$. The inner automorphisms form a [[subgroup]] $Inn(G)$, called the __inner automorphism group__ of $G$, of the entire [[automorphism group]] $Aut(G)$; it is the [[image]] of the natural map $G\to Aut(G)$ given by $g\mapsto\phi_g$. The [[center]] of a group $G$ is precisely the [[kernel]] of this natural map. Similarly, the monoidal center due to Drinfel'd and Majid, in the case when the monoidal category is Picard, is a $2$-category-theoretic kernel (an observation due to L. Breen). 

Higher analogues of the inner automorphism group were studied by Roberts and Schreiber.

## Idea

A __permutation__ on a [[set]] $X$ is equivalently

* a [[bijection]] from $X$ to itself, 

* a [[pair]] of [[linear orderings]] on $X$;

* an element in the [[symmetric group]] of $X$.


In the case of a set that is already equipped with a natural [[ordering]] (such as a finite [[ordinal]] $X = \{1,\dots,n\}$), these two ways of defining permutations are interchangeable, but they correspond to different abstract [[structures]] that are more salient in different contexts, and to different natural ways of comparing permutations.
Typically, the definition of permutations-as-[[automorphisms]] is important in [[group theory]], while the definition of permutations-as-linear-orders is more common in [[combinatorics]].
Both views of permutations are relevant to the theory of [[symmetric operads]].

## Definitions

### Permutations as automorphisms, and conjugacy

As automorphisms $\sigma : X \to X$ in [[Set]], the permutations of $X$ naturally form a [[group]] under [[composition]], called the __symmetric group__ (or __permutation group__) on $X$.
This group may be denoted $S_X$, $\Sigma_X$, or $X!$.
When $X$ is [[the]] [[finite set]] $(n) = \{1,\dots,n\}$, then its symmetric group is a [[finite group]] of [[cardinality]] $n!$ = "$n$ [[factorial]]", and one typically writes $S_n$ or $\Sigma_n$.

Two permutations $\sigma : X \to X$ and $\tau : Y \to Y$ are said to be **conjugate** (written $\sigma \cong \tau$) just in case there is a bijection $f : X \to Y$ such that $\sigma = f^{-1} \tau f$, or equivalently, when there is a commuting square of bijections:

$$\array{& X & \overset{f}\rightarrow & Y & \\
          \sigma & \downarrow &&\downarrow & \tau\\
          &X & \underset{f}\rightarrow& Y & \\
}$$

Observe that conjugacy is an [[equivalence relation]], and that conjugacy classes of permutations of $X$ are in one-to-one correspondence with [[partitions]] of $X$ (see below).

### Permutations as linear orders, and pattern containment

If $X$ is a set equipped with a [[linear ordering]] $\lt$, then a permutation of $X$ is the same thing as a second (unrelated) linear ordering $\lt_\sigma$ on $X$.
Indeed, suppose we label the elements of $X$ according to the $\lt$ order as $x_1 \lt x_2 \lt \dots$, and according to the $\lt_\sigma$ order as $\sigma_1 \lt_\sigma \sigma_2 \lt_\sigma \dots$.
Then we can define a bijection $\sigma : X \to X$ as the function sending $x_1 \mapsto \sigma_1$, $x_2 \mapsto \sigma_2$, and so on.
Conversely, any bijection $\sigma : X \to X$ induces a linear ordering $\lt_\sigma$ on $X$ by defining $x \lt_\sigma x'$ iff $\sigma(x) \lt \sigma(x')$.

This way of viewing permutations naturally gives rise to "array notation" (or "one-line notation"), where a permutation $\sigma : X \to X$ is represented as the list of elements $\sigma = (\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\dots)$, and it may be contrasted with "cycle notation" (see below).
Whereas cycle notation makes it easy to compare permutations for conjugacy, array notation leads to a different natural way of comparing permutations known as **pattern containment**.

Given two linearly ordered sets $(X,\lt_X)$ and $(Y,\lt_Y)$, a permutation (or "pattern") $\sigma : X \to X$ is said to be _contained_ in a permutation $\tau : Y \to Y$ (written $\sigma \preceq \tau$) just in case there exists a [[monotone function|monotone]] [[injective]] function $f : X \to Y$ such that
$$\sigma_i \lt_X \sigma_j \Rightarrow \tau_{f(i)} \lt_Y \tau_{f(j)}$$
for all $i,j \in X$, or in other words, if $\tau = (\tau_1,\tau_2,\dots)$ contains a subsequence of elements whose relative ordering (in $Y$) is the same as the relative ordering (in $X$) of the sequence $\sigma = (\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\dots)$.
Note that this definition of $\sigma \preceq \tau$ is equivalent to asking for the existence of a commuting square:

$$\array{& X & \overset{f}\rightarrow & Y & \\
          \sigma & \downarrow &&\downarrow & \tau\\
          &X & \underset{g}\rightarrow& Y & \\
}$$

where $f$ and $g$ are monotone injections (each uniquely determined by the other).

Whereas conjugacy defines an equivalence relation on the permutations of a particular set $X$, pattern containment defines a [[partial order]] on the permutations of arbitrary linearly ordered sets (which restricts to the [[equality|discrete order]] on the permutations of $X$).

### r-permutations

In combinatorics, one sometimes also wants a slight generalisation of the notion of permutation-as-linear-order: for any [[natural number]] $r$, an _$r$-permutation_ of $X$ is an [[injective function]] $\sigma : (r) \to X$.
An $r$-permutation corresponds to a list of $r$ distinct elements of $X$, so that for a finite set $X$ of cardinality $n = |X|$, an $n$-permutation is the same thing as an ordinary permutation of $X$ (it is [[surjective]] and therefore [[bijective]], since [[Set]] is a [[balanced category]]).
More generally, the number of $r$-permutations of a set of cardinality $n$ is counted by the [[falling factorial]] $n^{\underline{r}} = n(n-1)\dots(n-r+1)$.

## Properties

### Cycle decomposition

As an element of the [[symmetric group]] $S_X$, every permutation $\sigma : X \to X$ generates a [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] $\langle \sigma \rangle$, and hence inherits a [[group action]] on $X$.  The [[orbits]] of this action partition the set $X$ into a disjoint union of cycles, called the **cyclic decomposition** of the permutation $\sigma$.

For example, let $\sigma$ be the permutation on $(6)$ defined by

$$\sigma = (\array{1 \mapsto 1 & 2 \mapsto 4 & 3 \mapsto 5 & 4 \mapsto 6 & 5 \mapsto 3 & 6 \mapsto 2})$$

The domain of the permutation is partitioned into three $\langle\sigma\rangle$-orbits 

$$(6) = \{1\} \cup \{2,4,6\} \cup \{3,5\}$$

corresponding to the three cycles

$$1 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 1 \qquad
2 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 4 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 6 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 2 \qquad
3 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 5 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 3$$

We can express this more compactly by writing $\sigma$ in "cycle notation", as the composition $\sigma = (1)(2\,4\,6)(3\,5)$, or $\sigma = (2\,4\,6)(3\,5)$ leaving implicit the action of the identity (1).

##Idea and definition##

A polyhedron (beware remark \ref{RemarkOnTerminology}) is a [[topological space]] made up of very simple bits 'glued' together. The 'bits' are **[[simplices]]** of different [[dimensions]]. An abstract _simplicial complex_ is a neat combinatorial way of giving the corresponding 'gluing' instructions, a bit like the plan of a construction kit!

+--{: .num_defn}
######Definition#######

A **simplicial complex** $K$ (sometimes called an **abstract** simplicial complex) consists of 

1. a [[set]] of objects, $V(K)$, called **vertices** 

1. a set, $S(K)$, of finite non-empty subsets of $V(K)$, called **[[simplex|simplices]]**.  

such that the simplices satisfy the following conditions: 

1. if $\sigma \subset V(K)$ is a simplex and $\tau \subset \sigma$, $\tau \ne \emptyset$, then $\tau$ is also a simplex; 

1. every singleton $\{v\}$, $v \in V(K)$, is a simplex.  

=--

We say $\tau$ is a **face** of $\sigma$.  If $\sigma \in S(K)$ has $p+1$ elements it is said to be a **$p$-simplex**.  The set of $p$-simplices of $K$ is denoted by $K_p$. The **dimension** of $K$ is the largest $p$ such that $K_p$ is non-empty. 

A **map** of simplicial complexes $K \to L$ is a function $f: V(K) \to V(L)$ such that whenever $\sigma \subseteq V(K)$ belongs to $S(K)$, the [[image]] $f(\sigma)$ belongs to $S(L)$.

###### Remark

The word 'polyhedron' is used here as it is often used by [[algebraic topology|algebraic topologists]], as a space described by a simplicial complex. Elsewhere in mathematics, it might mean a finite union of finite intersections of sets in Euclidean space defined by linear inequalities, usually assumed compact, and often with other assumptions as well (e.g., connected or convex). The various usages have a long history, as recounted in detail in Lakatos's _Proofs and Refutations_.

##Examples##
1. Recall that a 'simple' graph is an undirected [[graph]] with no loops or multiple edges. A simple graph is essentially the same thing as a 1-dimensional simplicial complex, by interpreting edges as simplices and vice versa (see [[graph#undirected_graphs_as_1complexes_barycentric_subdivision|undirected graphs as 1-complexes]]). (On the other hand, a 1-dimensional [[simplicial set]] is essentially the same thing as a 'directed multigraph', i.e., a [[quiver]].)

1. Given a space and an [[open cover]], the nerve of the cover is a simplicial complex (see [[Čech methods]] and the discussion there). The [[Vietoris complex]] is another given by a related method.

1. Given any two sets $X$ and $Y$, and a relation $R\subseteq X\times Y$, there are two simplicial complexes that encode information on the relation. These are generalisations of the nerve and the Vietoris complex. They are studied in detail in [[Dowker's theorem]].

1.  If $(P,\leq)$ is a [[poset]], then the [[nerve]] of the associated category has a simple description. The vertices are the points of $P$ and the simplices are the [[flag|flags]].


1. **Buildings:**
An important class of simplicial complexes is provided by the notion of [[building]], due to Jacques Tits.  


##Simplicial complexes v. simplicial sets {#vsSSet}

Simplicial complexes are, in some sense, special cases of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]], but only 'in some sense'. 

To get from a simplicial complex to a fairly small simplicial set, you  pick a [[total order]] on the set of vertices. Without an order on the vertices, you cannot speak of the $k^{th}$ face of a simplex, which is an essential feature of a simplicial set! The degeneracies are obtained by repeating an element when listing the vertices of a simplex. If $\sigma = \{v_0,v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$, with $v_0\lt v_1\lt \ldots \lt v_n$ then, for instance, $s_0(\sigma) = \{v_0,v_0, v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$. 

If you do not want to pick an order then you can still form a simplicial set where to each $n$-simplex of the original simplicial complex will correspond to $(n+1)!$ simplices of that associated simplicial set. The result is more unwieldy, but can be useful under some circumstances as it defines a functor from the category of simplicial complexes to that of simplicial sets.  This is very important when discussing group actions on simplicial complexes and how this transfers to the associated simplicial set.

##Simplicial complexes as sheaves on a site##

Simplicial sets are essentially (that is, up to equivalence) [[presheaves]] on the [[simplex category]] of finite nonempty totally ordered sets, whereas simplicial complexes may be regarded as [[concrete sheaf|concrete presheaves]] on the category $Fin_{+}$ of finite nonempty sets and functions between them. This works as follows: given a simplicial complex, $K = (V(K), S(K))$, define a presheaf $K^\sim: Fin_{+}^{op} \to Set$ whose values are sets of functions $\phi$: 

$$K^\sim(B) \stackrel{def}{=} \{\phi: B \to V(K)| \phi(B) \in S(K)\}, \qquad K^\sim(f: A \to B)(\phi) \stackrel{def}{=} \phi \circ f$$ 

This defines an evident [[functor]] 

$$SimpComplex \to Set^{Fin_{+}^{op}}: K \mapsto K^\sim$$ 

that is [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]]. The essential image is the subcategory of concrete presheaves, where a presheaf $F \colon Fin_{+}^{op} \to Set$ is **concrete** if the canonical map 

$$F(B) \to F(1)^{\hom(1, B)}$$ 

is an injection. The point is that a morphism of concrete presheaves $F \to G$ is uniquely determined from the function $F(1) \to G(1)$ between their underlying sets (i.e., the underlying-set functor on concrete presheaves is [[faithful functor|faithful]], so that a concrete presheaf is a set equipped with extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]] -- that's what makes it "concrete"). 

(Equivalently but somewhat more elaborately, the category of concrete presheaves is the same as the full subcategory of [[concrete sheaf|concrete sheaves]] on $Fin_{+}$ with respect to the trivial [[Grothendieck topology|topology]], where the only covering sieve $F \hookrightarrow hom(-, D)$ is the maximal sieve.) 

From this point of view, it is immediate that simplicial complexes are the [[separated presheaf|separated objects]] for the [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] on $Set^{Fin_{+}^{op}}$ whose sheaves are sets, via the sheafification functor 

$$\Gamma = \hom(\mathbf{1}, -) = ev_1 \colon Set^{Fin_{+}^{op}} \to Set$$ 

which has a right adjoint. (See [[local topos]].) It follows from this characterization that the category of simplicial complexes is a [[quasitopos]], and in particular is locally cartesian closed. The category of simplicial sets on the other hand is a [[topos]]. 

##Geometric realisations and Polyhedra##

An abstract simplicial complex is a combinatorial gadget that models certain aspects of a spatial configuration.  Sometimes it is useful, perhaps even necessary, to produce a topological space from that data in a simplicial complex. 

### Idea
To each simplicial complex $K$, one can associate a topological space called the _polyhedron_ of $K$ often also called the  _geometric realisation_ of $K$ and denoted $|K|$.   (This is essentially a special case of the geometric realisation of a simplicial sets.)


This can be constructed by taking a copy $K(\sigma)$ of a standard topological $p$-simplex for each $p$-simplex of $K$ and then 'gluing' them together according to the face relations encoded in $K$.

We therefore first need the definition of a standard $p$-simplex

+--{: .num_defn}
######Definition######
The _standard (topological) $p$-simplex_ is (usually)  taken to be the convex hull of the basis vectors $\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2,\ldots, \mathbf{e}_{p+1}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{p+1}$.
=--

###Intuition
The geometric realisation $|K|$ of a simplicial complex, $K$  is then constructed by taking, for each abstract $p$-simplex, $\sigma\in S(K)$, a copy, $K(\sigma)$ of such a standard topological $p$-simplex, and then 'gluing' faces together, so whenever $\tau$ is a face of $\sigma$ we identify $K(\tau)$ with the corresponding face of $K(\sigma)$. This space is usually denoted $\Delta^p$.

###Canonical construction

As a set, $|K|$ is constructed as follows: 

$|K|$ is the set of all functions from $V(K)$ to  the closed interval $[0,1]$ such that

$$\{v \in V(K) \mid \alpha(v)  \neq  0\}$$

is a simplex of $K$;

 * for each $\alpha \in {|K|}$,  
$$\sum_{v \in V(K)} \alpha (v) = 1.$$

There are two commonly used topologies on the set $|K|$. The first is the _metric topology_: we put a metric $d$ on $|K|$ by 

$$d(\alpha,\beta) = \Big(\sum_{v\in V(K)} (\alpha(v) - \beta(v))^2\Big)^\frac{1}{2}.$$

$|K|$, when endowed with the metric space topology, will be denoted $|K|_d$. Notice that when $V(K)$ is finite, this gives $|K|_d$ as a subspace of the metric space $\mathbb{R}^{\#(V(K))}$ (which is usually of much higher dimension than might seem geometrically significant in a given context). 

The second topology is the _coherent topology_: each geometric simplex $|s|$ consists of all $\alpha \in {|K|}$ supported in $s$, and is given the subspace topology inherited as a subset of $|K|_d$; then the coherent topology on $|K|$ is the largest topology for which all inclusions ${|s|} \hookrightarrow {|K|}$ are continuous. This topological space is normally denoted just $|K|$, reflecting the fact that the coherent topology is regarded as the default topology to put on the set $|K|$. 

Note that if $s \subseteq t$ is an inclusion of simplices in $K$, then there is an induced subspace inclusion ${|s|} \hookrightarrow {|t|}$. The space $|K|$ may then be characterized as the colimit in $Top$ of the diagram consisting of geometric simplices $|s|$ and inclusions between them, so that a function $f: {|K|} \to X$ is continuous if and only if its restriction to each simplex $|s|$ is continuous. In particular, the identity function ${|K|} \to {|K|}_d$ is continuous, so that the coherent topology contains the metric topology (and is often strictly larger). 

* **Warning:** The geometric realization of a simplicial complex does not preserve products. Indeed, the product of two intervals in the category of simplicial complexes is the tetrahedron! 

## Triangulable spaces

If a topological space can be described up to homeomorphism as the geometric realization of a simplicial complex, we say it is **triangulable**, and a **triangulation** of a space $X$ is a simplicial complex $K$ together with a homeomorphism $h: |K| \to X$. (This is discussed in a bit more detail in the entry on [[classical triangulation]]. 

There is another stronger notion of triangulation used by geometric topologists: a **piecewise-linear (PL) structure** on a [[topological manifold]] $X$ is given by a [[manifold|PL atlas]], where the transition functions are piecewise-linear homeomorphisms. (A homeomorphism $U \to V$ is **piecewise linear** if its graph is the intersection of $U \times V$ with a semilinear set $S$, meaning that $S$ is given by a finite Boolean combination of solution sets of linear inequalities.)  



#### Examples from manifold theory

* All [[manifold|smooth manifolds]] are triangulable and, in fact, admit PL structures. 

* All topological manifolds in dimensions 2 and 3 admit PL structures, and are in fact smoothable (admit a smooth manifold structure). 

* The $E_8$ [[E8 manifold|manifold]] does not admit a triangulation, much less a PL structure. 

* In dimensions $n \geq 5$, the $(n-2)$-fold suspension of the [[Poincaré sphere]] is homeomorphic to the $n$-sphere, hence is triangulable, but it does not admit a PL structure. 

#### Relation to simplicial sets

The following statement may seem obvious, but it requires careful proof: 

* A space is triangulable if and only if it is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of a simplicial set. 

As an important step: 

* The geometric realization of the nerve of a poset is triangulable. 

The basic technique is to use [[subdivision]].

For $V$ a [[vector space]] over the [[real numbers]] or some other $\mathbb{R}$-[[module]], its _complexification_ is the [[tensor product]] over $\mathbb{R}$ with the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$: the _[[extension of scalars]]_ along the canonical inclusion $\mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$.

## Idea

The term _intertwiner_ is a synonym for _[[homomorphism]] of [[representations]]/[[actions]]/[[modules]]_.

Notably for [[linear representations]] $\rho_1$, $\rho_2$ of some [[group]] or [[associative algebra]] $A$ on [[vector spaces]] $V_1, V_2$, a [[linear map]] $u : V_1 \to V_2$ is said to _intertwine_ $\rho_1$ with $\rho_2$ if for all $a \in A$ we have that

$$
  u \circ \rho_1(a) = \rho_2(a)\circ u

## Idea

An **exact sequence** may be defined in a [[semi-abelian category]], and more generally in a [[homological category]]. It is a [[sequential diagram]] in which the [[image]] of each [[morphism]] is equal to the [[kernel]] of the next morphism.


## Definition
 {#Definition}


### Definition in additive categories
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[additive category]] (often assumed to be an [[abelian category]], for instance $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]] for $R$ some [[ring]]).

+-- {: .num_defn #ExactSequence}
###### Definition

An **exact sequence** in $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[chain complex]] $C_\bullet$ in $\mathcal{A}$ with vanishing [[chain homology]] in each degree:

$$
  \forall n \in \mathbb{N} . H_n(C) = 0 
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #ShortExactSequence}
###### Definition

A **short exact sequence** is an exact sequence, def. \ref{ExactSequence} of the form

$$
  \cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

One usually writes this just "$0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$" or even just "$A \to B \to C$".

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A general exact sequence is sometimes called a **long exact sequence**, to distinguish from the special case of a short exact sequence.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #CharacterizationByMonoEpi}
###### Proposition

Explicitly, a sequence of morphisms 

$$ 
  0 \to A \stackrel{i}\to B \stackrel{p}\to C  \to 0
$$

is short exact, def. \ref{ShortExactSequence}, precisely if

1. $i$ is a [[monomorphism]],

1. $p$ is an [[epimorphism]], 

1. and the [[image]] of $i$ equals the [[kernel]] of $p$  (equivalently, the [[coimage]] of $p$ equals the [[cokernel]] of $i$).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The third condition is the definition of exactness at $B$. So we need to show that the first two conditions are equivalent to exactness at $A$ and at $C$.

This is easy to see by looking at elements when $\mathcal{A} \simeq R$[[Mod]], for some ring $R$ (and the general case can be reduced to this one using one of the [embedding theorems](abelian%20category#EmbeddingTheorems)):

The sequence being exact at

$$
  0 \to A \to B
$$

means, since the [[image]] of $0 \to A$ is just the element $0 \in A$, that the [[kernel]] of $A \to B$ consists of just this element. But since $A \to B$ is a [[group homomorphism]], this means equivalently that $A \to B$ is an [[injection]]. 

Dually, the sequence being exact at

$$
  B \to C \to 0
$$

means, since the [[kernel]] of $C \to 0$ is all of $C$, that also the [[image]] of $B \to C$ is all of $C$, hence equivalently that $B \to C$ is a [[surjection]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A **[[split exact sequence]]** is a short exact sequence as above in which $i$ is a [[split monomorphism]], or (equivalently) in which $p$ is a [[split epimorphism]].  

=--

In this case, $B$ may be decomposed as the [[biproduct]] $A \oplus C$ (with $i$ and $p$ the usual biproduct inclusion and projection); this sense in which $B$ is 'split' into $A$ and $C$ is the origin of the general terms 'split (mono/epi)morphism'.

### Definition in pointed sets
It is also helpful to consider a similar notion in the case of a [[pointed set]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
In the category $Set_*$ of [[pointed sets]], a sequence
$$
\array{
  (A, a) & \overset{f}{\to} & (B, b) & \overset{g}{\to} & (C, c)
}
$$
is said to be **exact** at $(B, b)$ if $im f = g^{-1}(c)$.

For [[concrete category|concrete]] pointed categories (ie. a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a faithful functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to Set_*$), a sequence is exact if the image under $F$ is exact.
=--

In the case of (abelian) categories like $Ab$ and $R-Mod$, the two notions of exactness coincide if we pick the point of each group/module to be $0$. Such a general notion is useful in cases such as the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] where the homotopy "groups" for small $n$ are just pointed sets without a group structure.

## Properties

### Computing terms in an exact sequence

A typical use of a long exact sequence, notably of the [[homology long exact sequence]], is that it allows to determine some of its entries in terms of others.

The characterization of short exact sequences in prop. \ref{CharacterizationByMonoEpi} is one example for this: whenever in a long exact sequence one entry vanishes as in $\cdot \to 0 \to C_n \to \cdot$ or $\cdot \to C_n \to 0 \to \cdots$, it follows that the _next_ morphism out of or into the vanishing entry is a [[monomorphism]] or [[epimorphism]], respectively.

In particular: 

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

If part of an exact sequence looks like

$$
  \cdots \to 0 \to C_{n+1} \stackrel{\partial_n}{\to} C_n \to 0 \to \cdots
  \,,
$$

then $\partial_n$ is an [[isomorphism]] and hence 

$$
  C_{n+1} \simeq C_n
  \,.
$$

=--


### Exactness and quasi-isomorphisms
 {#ExactnessAndQuasiIsomorphisms}

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

A chain complex $C_\bullet$ is exact (is a long exact sequence), precisely if the unique [[chain map]] from the [[initial object]], the 0-complex

  $$
    0 \to C_\bullet
  $$

is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

=--

### Short exact sequences and quotients
 {#SESAndQuotients}

The following are some basic lemmas that show how given a short exact sequence one obtains new short exact sequences from forming [[quotients]]/[[cokernels]] (see [Wise](#Wise)). 

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]]. 

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

For

$$
  A \to B \to C \to 0
$$

an exact sequence in $\mathcal{A}$ and for $X \to B$ any morphism in $\mathcal{A}$, also

$$
  A \to B/X \to C/X \to 0
$$

is a short exact sequence.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We have an exact sequence of complexes of length 2

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& X &\stackrel{id}{\to}& X &\to& 0
    \\
    \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to& B &\to& C &\to& 0
  }
$$

and the exact sequence to be demonstrated is degreewise the [[cokernel]] of this sequence. So the statement reduces to the fact that forming cokernels is a [[right exact functor]].

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

For

$$
  0 \to A \to B \to C
$$

an exact sequence and $X \to A$ any morphism, also 

$$
  0 \to A/X \to B/X  \to C
$$

is exact.

###### Example

Let $\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{Z}$[[Mod]] $\simeq$ [[Ab]]. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \geq 1$ let $\mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot n}{\to} \mathbb{Z}$ be the [[linear map]]/[[homomorphism]] of [[abelian groups]] which acts by the ordinary multiplication of [[integers]] by $n$. This is clearly an [[injection]]. The [[cokernel]] of this morphism is the projection to the [[quotient group]], which is the [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}_n \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Hence we have a short exact sequence

## Terminology

In [[field]] theory, what we call an 'absolute value' here is often called a 'valuation'.  However, there is also a more general notion of [[valuation]] used in field theory, which is what we call 'valuation'.  The notion of absolute value is also used in [[functional analysis]], where it may be called a 'multiplicative norm' (rather than merely submultiplicative, as norms on [[Banach algebras]] are required to be).


## Definition

For $k$ a [[rig]] (typically either a [[field]] or at least an [[integral domain]], or else an [[associative algebra]] over such), an **absolute value** on $k$ is a (non-trivial) multiplicative [[seminorm]], or equivalently a finite real-valued [[valuation]].

This means it is a [[function]] 

$$
  {\vert {-} \vert}\colon k \to \mathbb{R}
$$ 

to the [[real numbers]] such that for all $x, y \in k$

1. ${\vert x \vert} \geq 0$;

2. ${\vert x \vert} = 0$ precisely if $x = 0$;

3. ${\vert x \cdot y \vert} = {\vert x \vert} {\vert y \vert}$;

4. ${\vert x + y \vert} \leq {\vert x \vert} + {\vert y \vert}$ (the [[triangle inequality]]).


If the last triangle inequality is strengthened to

* ${\vert x + y \vert} \leq max({\vert x \vert}, {\vert y \vert})$ 

then ${\vert {-} \vert}$ is called an [[ultrametric]] or **non-archimedean** absolute value, since then for any $x, y \in k$ with $\vert x \vert \lt \vert y \vert$ then for all natural numbers $n$, $\vert n x \vert \leq \vert x \vert \lt \vert y \vert$.  If the opposite holds, that whenever $\vert x \vert \lt \vert y \vert$ (and $x\neq 0$) there exists a natural number $n$ with $\vert n x \vert \gt \vert y \vert$, then it is called **archimedean**.

Two absolute values ${\vert {-} \vert}_1$ and ${\vert {-} \vert}_2$ are called _equivalent_ if for all $x \in k$

$$
  ({\vert x \vert}_1 \lt 1)
   \Leftrightarrow
  ({\vert x \vert}_2 \lt 1)
  \,.
$$  

An [[equivalence class]] of absolute values is also called a **[[place]]**. 

A [[field]] equipped with an absolute value which is a [[complete metric space]] with respect to the corresponding [[metric]] is called a [[complete field]].


## Examples

### Trivial absolute value

Every field admits the trivial absolute value ${\vert {-} \vert}_0$ defined by

$$
  {\vert x \vert}_0 = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       0 & if\; x = 0
       \\
       1 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This is non-archimedean.


### On the real and complex numbers
 {#OnTheRealAndComplexNumbers}


Since the [[real numbers]] are a [[sequentially Cauchy complete]] [[Archimedean field]], the standard absolute value ${\vert {-} \vert_\infty}$ on the [[real numbers]] is

$$
  {\vert x \vert_\infty} = \lim_{n \to \infty} x \tanh(n x)
$$

With the standard absolute value function defined, the maximum and principal square root functions could be defined on the real numbers as well. 

The standard absolute value on the [[complex numbers]] is 

$$
  {\vert x + i y \vert_\infty}
  = 
  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
  \,.
$$

These standard absolute values are archimedean, and with respect to these standard absolute values, both $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are [[complete field|complete]] and hence are complete [[archimedean valued fields]]. Notice that $\mathbb{R}$ is in addition an [[ordered field]] and as such also an [[archimedean field]].

Similar norms exist on the [[quaternions]] and [[octonions]], showing that absolute values can be of interest on noncommutative and even nonassociative [[division rings]].


### On the rational numbers

The standard absolute value [above](#OnTheRealAndComplexNumbers) restricts to the standard absolute value on the [[rational numbers]]

$$
  {\vert {-} \vert_\infty}\colon \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

Moreover, for any [[prime number]] $p$ and [[positive number]] $\epsilon \lt 1$, there is an absolute value ${\vert {-} \vert_{p,\epsilon}}$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ defined by

$$
  \left\vert \frac{k}{l} p^n\right\vert_{p,\epsilon}
  = 
  \epsilon^n
$$

whenever $n$ is an [[integer]] and $k$ and $l$ are nonzero [[integers]] not divisible by $p$ (and ${\vert 0 \vert_{p,\epsilon}} = 0$).

These are called the **$p$-adic absolute values**.  Given $p$, they are all equivalent (the open unit ball consists of all rational numbers whose denominator in lowest terms is not divisible by $p$), so there is a unique **$p$-adic [[place]]**.  For most purposes, only the place matters, and one may write simply $|q|_p$; however, if one wants a specific absolute value, then the usual choice is to use $\epsilon = 1/p$ (so that ${|p^n|_p} = p^{-n}$ whenever $n$ is an integer).

The $p$-adic absolute value is non-archimedean. The [[complete field|completion]] $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ under this absolute value is called the field of [[p-adic numbers]], which is therefore a [[non-archimedean field]].

[[Ostrowski's theorem]] says that these examples exhaust the non-trivial absolute values on the [[rational numbers]]. Therefore the [[real numbers]] and the [[p-adic numbers]] are the only possible field completions of $\mathbb{Q}$.


### On Laurent power series

The field of [[Laurent series]] $k[ [ T] ]$ over a [[field]] $k$ is a [[complete field]] with respect to the absolute value that sends a series to $\epsilon^n$ for a fixed $0 \lt \epsilon \lt 1$ and with $n$ the lowest integer such that the $n$th coefficient of the series is not $0$.

## Idea

The _kernel_ of a [[morphism]] is that part of its [[domain]] which is sent to [[zero]].


## Definition

There are various definitions of the notion of kernel, depending on the properties and structures available in the ambient category. We list a few definitions and discuss (in parts) when they are equivalent.

### As a pullback 


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

In a [[category]] with an [[initial object]] $0$ and [[pullbacks]], the __kernel__ $ker(f)$ of a [[morphism]] $f: A \to B$ is the [[pullback]] $ker(f) \to A$ along $f$ of the unique morphism $0 \to B$

$$
  \array{
    ker(f)
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

More explicitly, this characterizes the object $ker(f)$ as [[generalized the|the]] object (unique up to unique [[isomorphism]]) that satisfies the following [[universal property]]:

for every object $C$ and every morphism $h : C \to A$ such that $f\circ h = 0$ is the [[zero morphism]], there is a unique morphism $\phi : C \to ker(f)$ such that $h = p\circ \phi$.

=--


### As an equalizer

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


In a [[category]] with [[zero morphism]]s (meaning: [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[category of pointed sets]]), [[generalized the|the]] **kernel** $ker(f)$ of a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ is, if it exists, the [[equalizer]] of $f$ and the zero morphism $0_{c,d}$.  

=--

### As a weighted limit 

In any category enriched over pointed sets, the kernel of a morphism $f:c\to d$ is the universal morphism $k:a\to c$ such that $f \circ k$ is the basepoint.  It is a [[weighted limit]] in the sense of [[enriched category theory]].  This applies in particular in any (pre)-[[additive category]].

This is a special case of the construction of [[generalized kernels]] in enriched categories.

### As a representing object

Let $Ab$ be the category of abelian groups. It is a category with kernels. In  every $Ab$-enriched category $A$, for every morphism $f: X\to Y$ in $A$ there is a [[subfunctor]] 

$$ker f : A^{op}\to Ab$$

of the representable functor $hom(-,X)$, defined on objects by

$$ (ker f)(Z) = ker(hom(Z,X)\to hom(Z,Y)), $$

where $ker$ on the right-hand side is the kernel n the category of abelian groups.

If the category is in fact preabelian, $ker f$ is also representable with representing object $Ker f$. One has to be careful with $Coker f$ which does not represent the functor naive  $coker f$ defined as $(coker f)(Z) = coker(hom(Z,X)\to hom(Z,Y))$ in $Ab$,
which is often not representable at all, even in the simple example of the category of abelian groups.  Instead, as a colimit construction, one should *co*represent another functor, namely, the covariant functor $Z\mapsto ker(hom(Y,Z) \to hom(X,Z))$ (which is a quotient of the corepresentable functor $hom(X,-)$). In short, $Coker f$ is defined by the double dualization using the kernel in $Ab$: $Coker f = (Ker f^{op})^{op}$.  This is a particular case of the dualization involved in defining any [[colimit]] from its corresponding [[limit]].

### In an $(\infty,1)$-category 

The kernel of a morphism in an [[(∞,1)-category]] with $\infty$-categorical [[zero object]] is the [[homotopy pullback]] as in the pullback definition above: the [[homotopy fiber]]. 

See also [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

### Other meanings 

In some fields, the term 'kernel' refers to an [[equivalence relation]] that category theorists would see as a [[kernel pair]].  This is especially important in fields such as [[monoid]] theory where both notions exist but are not equivalent (while in [[group]] theory they are equivalent).

In [[ring]] theory, even when one assumes that rings have units preserved by ring homomorphisms, the traditional notion of kernel (an [[ideal]]) exists in the category of non-unital rings (and is not itself a unital ring in general).  A purely category-theoretic theory of unital rings can be recovered either by using the kernel pair instead or (to fit better the usual language) moving to a category of [[modules]].

In [[universal algebra]], this may be handled in the framework of [[Malcev variety|Mal'cev varieties]].

Kashiwara-Schapira, following the terminology of EGA, uses kernel as a synonym of equalizer (and co-kernel of co-equalizer).

## Properties {#Properties}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Property

Let $C$ be a category with [[pullback]]s and [[zero object]].

In $C$, the kernel of a kernel is 0.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/pullback#Pasting">pasting law for pullbacks</a> we have that the total square

$$
  \array{
     ker ker f &\to& ker f  &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     0 &\to& c &\stackrel{f}{\to}& d
  }
$$

is a pullback. Since $0 \to c$ is a [[monomorphism]] and the pullback of a monomorphism along itself is the domain of the monomorphis, we have $ker ker f \simeq 0$.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This statement crucially fails to be true in [[higher category theory]]. There, the kernel of a kernel is the based [[loop space object]] of $d$. For this reason where one has [[short exact sequence]]s in 1-category theory, there are instead long [[fiber sequence]]s in higher category theory.

In a category $C$ with [[pullback]]s and [[pushout]]s and [[zero object]], kernel and [[cokernel]] form a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s on the [[arrow category|arrow categories]]

$$
  (coker \dashv ker) : Arr(C) \stackrel{\overset{coker}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{ker}{\to}} Arr(C)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


We check the hom-isomorphism of a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s. An element in the [[hom-set]] $Arr_C(g,ker f)$ is a [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     c &\to& ker(f) &\to& 0
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     d &\to& a &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the universal property of the [[pullback]], this is the same as a diagram

$$
  \array{
     c  &\to& &\to& 0
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && && \downarrow
     \\
     d &\to& a &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the dual reasoning, an element in $Arr_C(coker g, f)$ is a diagram

$$
  \array{
    c &\stackrel{g}{\to}& d &\to& a
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    0 &\to& coker g &\to& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the universal property of the [[pushout]] this is equivalently a diagram

$$
  \array{
    c &\stackrel{g}{\to}& d &\to& a
    \\
    \downarrow &&  && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    0 &\to&  &\to& b
  }
  \,.
$$

## Examples

###### Example

In the [[category]] [[Ab]] of abelian groups, the kernel of a [[group homomorphism]] $f : A \to B$ is the [[subgroup]] of $A$ on the set $f^{-1}(0)$ of elements of $A$ that are sent to the zero-element of $B$.

More generally, for $R$ any [[ring]], this is true in $R$[[Mod]]: the kernel of a morphism of modules is the [[preimage]] of the zero-element at the level of the underlying sets, equipped with the unique sub-module structure on that set.

## Idea

The _cellular simplex_ is one of the basic [[geometric shapes for higher structures]]. Variants of the same "shape archetype" exist in several settings, e.g., that of a [[simplicial set]], the topological /cellular one, and categorical contexts, plus others.

## Definitions
 {#Definition}

### Simplicial simplices
 {#SimplicialSimplex}

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the standard _simplicial $n$-simplex_ $\Delta[n]$ is the [[simplicial set]] which is represented (as a [[presheaf]]) by the object $[n]$ in the [[simplex category]], so $\Delta[n]= \Delta(-,[n])$.


### Cellular (simplicial) simplex
 {#CellularSimplex}

Likewise, there is a standard topological $n$-simplex, which is (more or less by definition) the [[geometric realization]] of the standard simplicial $n$-simplex.

### Topological simplex
 {#TopologicalSimplex}

The _topological $n$-simplex_ $\Delta^n$ is a generalization of the standard filled _[[triangle]]_ in the plane, from [[dimension]] 2 to arbitrary dimensions. Each $\Delta^n$ is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the closed $n$-[[ball]] $D^n$, but its defining [[embedding]] into a [[Cartesian space]] equips its [[boundary]] with its cellular decomposition into _[[faces]]_, generalizing the way that the triangle has three [[edges]] (which are 1-simplices) as [[faces]], and three points (which are [[vertices]] or 0-simplices) as corners.

The topological $n$-simplex is naturally defined as a [[subspace]] of a
[[Cartesian space]] given by some relation on its canonical 
[[coordinates]]. There are two standard choices for such coordinate
presentation, which of course define [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]]
$n$-simplices:

* [Barycentric coordinates](#BarycentricCoordinates)

* [Cartesian coordinates](#CartesianCoordinates)

Each of these has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on application, but of course there is a simple coordinate transformation that exhibits an explicit [[homeomorphism]] between the two:

* [Transformation between Barycentric and Cartesian coordinates](#CoordinateTransformation).


#### Barycentric coordinates
 {#BarycentricCoordinates}


In the following, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we regard the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ as equipped with the canonical [[coordinates]] labeled $x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}$.

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalInBarycentricCoords}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **topological $n$-simplex** is, 
up to [[homeomorphism]], the [[topological space]] whose underlying set is

$$
  \Delta^n \coloneqq 
  \{
    \vec x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
    |
    \sum_{i = 0 }^n x_i = 1 \; and \;
    \forall i . x_i \geq 0 
  \}
  \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and whose topology is the  [[subspace topology]] induces from the canonical topology in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\n \geq 1$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$, the 
**$k$th $(n-1)$-face (inclusion)**  of the topological $n$-simplex is the subspace inclusion

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \hookrightarrow \Delta^n
$$

of the "right" end of the standard interval. The other inclusion 

$$
  \delta_1 : \Delta^0 \to \Delta^1
$$ 

is that of the "left" end $\{0\} \hookrightarrow [0,1]$.

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n} \to \Delta^{n-1}
$$

induced under the barycentric coordinates of def. \ref{TopologicalInBarycentricCoords} under the surjection

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

which sends

$$
  (x_0, \cdots, x_n) \mapsto (x_0, \cdots, x_{k} + x_{k+1}, \cdots, x_n)

###### Proposition

The collection of face inclusions, def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}
and degeneracy projections, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}
satisfy the (dual) [[simplicial identities]]. Equivalently, they constitute the components of a [[functor]]

$$

from the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ to the category [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]]. This is, up to [[isomorphism]], the standard [[cosimplicial object]] in $Top$.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This definition identifies the topological $n$-simplex with the space of [[interval]] maps (preserving top and bottom) $\{0 \lt 1 \lt \ldots \lt n+1\} \to I$ into the topological interval. This point of view takes advantage of the [duality](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/simplex+category#duality_with_intervals_23) between the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ and the category $\nabla$ of finite [[intervals]] with distinct top and bottom. Indeed, it follows from the duality that we obtain a functor 

$$\Delta \simeq \nabla^{op} \stackrel{Int(-, I)}{\to} Top.$$ 

=--


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

* For $n = 0$ this is the [[point]], $\Delta^0 = *$.

* For $n = 1$ this is the standard [[interval object]] $\Delta^1 = [0,1]$.

* For $n = 2$ this is a triangle sitting in the plane like this:

  $$
    \left\{
      (x_0,x_1) | 0 \leq x_0 \leq x_1 \leq 1
    \right\}
    = 
    \left\{
    \array{
       && && (1,1)
       \\
       && & \nearrow & \downarrow
       \\

       (0,0) &\stackrel{}{\to}& (0,\tfrac{1}{2}) & \to & (0,1)
    }
    \right\}

#### Transformation between Barycentric and Cartesian coordinates
 {#CoordinateTransformation}

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$,  write now explicitly 

$$
 \Delta^n_{bar} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

for the topological $n$-simplex in barycentric coordinate presentation, def. \ref{TopologicalInBarycentricCoords}, and 

$$
 \Delta^n_{cart} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}
$$

for the topological $n$-simplex in Cartesian coordinate presentation, def. \ref{TopologicalInCartesianCoordinates}.  

Write

$$
  S_n : \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

for the [[continuous function]] given in the standard coordinates by

$$
  (x_0, \cdots, x_{n})
  \mapsto
  (x_0, x_0 + x_1, \cdots, \sum_{i = 0}^k x_i, \cdots, \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} x_i)
  \,.
$$

By restriction, this induces a continuous function on the topological $n$-simplices

$$
  \array{
     \Delta^n_{bar} &\hookrightarrow& \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{S_n|_{\Delta^n_{bar}}}} && \downarrow^{p_n}
     \\
     \Delta^n_{cart} &\hookrightarrow& \mathbb{R}^n
  }
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the function $S_n$ is a [[homeomorphism]]
and respects the face and degeneracy maps.

Equivalently, $S_\bullet$ is a [[natural isomorphism]] of [[functors]] 
$\Delta^n \to Top$, hence an [[isomorphism]] of [[cosimplicial objects]]

$$
  S_\bullet : \Delta^\bullet_{bar} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Delta^\bullet_{cart}
  \,.

### Singular simplex
 {#SingularSimplex}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X \in $ [[nLab:Top]]  and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a **singular $n$-simplex** in $X$ is a [[nLab:continuous map]]

$$
  \sigma : \Delta^n \to X
  \,.
$$

Write 

$$
  (Sing X)_n \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\Delta^n , X)
$$ 

for the set of singular $n$-simplices of $X$.

=--

As $n$ varies, this forms the [[singular simplicial complex]] of $X$.

## Idea

A [[monomorphism]] is _regular_ if it behaves like an [[embedding]].

* [[effective epimorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular epimorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[covering]]

* [[effective monomorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular monomorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[embedding]] .

The universal factorization through an embedding is the [[image]].


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A **regular monomorphism** is a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ in some [[category]] which occurs as the [[equalizer]] of _some_ [[pair of parallel morphisms]] $d \stackrel{\to}{\to} e$, i.e. for which a [[limit]] [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  c \stackrel{f}{\to} d \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} e
$$

exists.

=--

From the defining [[universal property]] of the [[limit]] it follows directly that a regular monomorphism is in particular a [[monomorphism]].

The dual concept is that of a [[regular epimorphism]].

\begin{rmk} Beware that ([CassidyHebertKelly](#CassidyHebertKelly)) use 'regular monomorphism' in a more general way: for them, a regular monomorphism is by definition the joint equalizer of an arbitrary family of parallel pairs of morphisms with common domain.
This concept is sometimes called [[strict monomorphism]], dual to the more commonly used [[strict epimorphism]]. \end{rmk}

## Properties

### Relation to effective monomorphisms 

+-- {: .num_defn #EffectiveMonomorphism}
###### Definition

A monomorphism $i: A \to B$ is an [[effective monomorphism]] if it is the [[equalizer]] of its [[cokernel pair]]: if the [[pushout]]

$$\array{
A & \stackrel{i}{\to} & B \\
i \downarrow & & \downarrow i_1 \\
B & \underset{i_2}{\to} & B +_A B
}$$ 

exists and $i$ is the equalizer of the pair of coprojections $i_1, i_2: B \stackrel{\to}{\to} B +_A B$. Obviously effective monomorphisms are regular. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #RegEquEff} 
###### Proposition

In a [[category]] with [[equalizers]] and [[cokernel pairs]], the class of  regular monomorphism coincides with that of [[effective monomorphism]] (def. \ref{EffectiveMonomorphism}).

=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

It is clear that every effective monomorphism is regular, we need to show the converse.

Suppose $i \colon A \to B$ is the equalizer of a pair of morphisms $f, g: B \to C$, and with notation as in def. \ref{EffectiveMonomorphism}, let $j: E \to B$ be the equalizer of the pair of coprojections $i_1, i_2$. Since $f \circ i = g \circ i$, there exists a unique map $\phi: B +_A B \to C$ such that $\phi \circ i_1 = f$ and $\phi \circ i_2 = g$. Then, since 
$$f j = \phi i_1 j = \phi i_2 j = g j$$ 
and since $i: A \to B$ is the equalizer of the pair $(f, g)$, there is a unique map $k: E \to A$ such that $j = i k$. Since $i_1 i = i_2 i$, there is a unique map $l: A \to E$ such that $i = j l$. The maps $k$, $l$ are mutually inverse. 

=-- 





## Examples {#Examples}

* In [[Set]], or more generally in any [[pretopos]], every [[monomorphism]] is regular.

* Similarly, in [[Ab]], and more generally any [[abelian category]], every monomorphism is regular.

+-- {: .num_prop #RegularMonomorphismsOfTopologicalSpaces}
###### Proposition
**(regular monomorphisms of [[topological spaces]])**

In the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological space]], 

1. the [[monomorphisms]] are the those [[continuous functions]] which are [[injective functions]];

1. the regular monomorphisms are the [[topological embeddings]] (that is, the injective continuous functions whose sources have the [[induced topology|topologies induced]] from their targets); these are in fact all of the [[extremal monomorphisms]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

Regarding the first statement: an injective continuous function $f \colon X \to Y$ clearly has the cancellation property that defines monomorphisms: for parallel continuous functions $g_1,g_2 \colon Z \to X$: if $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_1$, then $g_1 = g_2$ because continuous functions are equal precisely if their underlying functions of sets are equal. Conversely, if $f$ has the cancellation property, then testing on points $g_1, g_2 \colon \ast \to X$ gives that $f$ is injective.

Regarding the second statement: from the construction of [[equalizers]] in [[Top]] ([this example](Top#EqualizerInTop)) we have that these are topological subspace inclusions.

Conversely, let  $i \colon X \to Y$ be a [[topological subspace embedding]]. We need to show that this is the equalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms.

To that end, form the [[cokernel pair]] $(i_1, i_2)$ by taking the [[pushout]] of $i$ against itself (in the category of sets, and using the [[quotient topology]] on a [[disjoint union space]]). By prop. \ref{RegEquEff}, the equalizer of that pair is the set-theoretic equalizer of that pair of functions endowed with the [[subspace topology]]. Since monomorphisms in [[Set]] are regular, we get the function $i$ back and (again by [this example](Top#EqualizerInTop)) it is equipped with the subspace topology. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #reg}
###### Proposition 
In [[Grp]], the monics are (up to [[isomorphism]]) the inclusions of [[subgroup]]s, and every monomorphism is regular.
=--

In contrast, the [[normal monomorphisms]] (where one of the morphisms $d \to e$ is required to be the [[zero morphism]]) are the inclusions of [[normal subgroups]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
The elementary proof we give follows [exercise 7H](http://katmat.math.uni-bremen.de/acc/acc.pdf#page=129) of ([AdamekHerrlichStrecker](#AdamekHerrlichStrecker)). It is however nonconstructive (because it contains if-then-else lines); for a constructive proof, see [here](/nlab/show/Grp#eq). 

Let $K \hookrightarrow H$ be a subgroup. We 
need to define another group $G$ and group homomorphisms 
$f_1, f_2 : H \to G$ such that

$$
  K = \{h \in H  | f_1(h) = f_2(h)\}
  \,.
$$

To that end, let 

$$
  X  := H/K  \coprod  \{\hat K\}  := \{ h K | h \in H \}  \coprod  \{\hat K\} 
$$

be the set of [[coset]]s together with one more element $\hat K$.

Let then

$$ 
  G = Aut_{Set}(X)
$$

be the [[permutation group]] on $X$. 

Define $\rho \in G$ to be the permutation that exchanges the coset $e K$ with the extra element $\hat K$ and is the identity on all other elements.

Finally define group homomorphism $f_1,f_2 : H \to G$ by

$$
  f_1(h) : x \mapsto 
  \left\{
     \array{
        h h' K & if x = h' K
        \\
        \hat K & if x = \hat K
     }
  \right.
$$

and

$$
  f_2(h) = \rho \circ f_1(h) \circ \rho^{-1}
  \,.
$$

It is clear that these maps are indeed group homomorphisms.

So for $h \in H$ we have that 

$$
  f_1(h) : \hat K \mapsto \hat K
  \,,
$$

and

$$
  f_1(h) : e K \mapsto h K
$$

and

$$
  f_2(h) 
  : 
  \hat K 
   \mapsto 
  e K 
    \mapsto 
   h K 
   \mapsto 
  \left\{
    \array{
     \hat K & if h \in K
     \\
     h K & otherwise
   }
   \right.
  \,.
$$

$$
  f_2(h) : e K \mapsto \hat K \mapsto \hat K \mapsto e K
  \,.
$$

So we have $f_1(h) = f_2(h)$ precisely if $h \in K$.

=-- 



## In an $(\infty,1)$-category {#Infty1Version}

In the context of [[higher category theory]]
the ordinary [[limit]] diagram $c \stackrel{f}{\to} d \stackrel{\to}{\to} e $ may be thought of as the beginning of a [[homotopy limit]] diagram over a [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] diagram

$$
  c \stackrel{f}{\to} d_0 \stackrel{\to}{\to} d_1
  \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
  d_2
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

Accordingly, it is not unreasonable to define a 
[[regular monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category]], to be a morphism which is the [[limit in a quasi-category]] of a cosimplicial diagram.

In practice this is of particular relevance for the $\infty$-version of [[regular epimorphism]]s: with the analogous definition as described there, a morphism $f : c \to d$ is a [[regular epimorphism]] in an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ if for all objects $e \in C$ the induced morphism $f^* : C(d,e) \to C(c,e)$ is a [[regular monomorphism]] in [[∞Grpd]] (for instance [[model structure on simplicial sets|modeled]] by a [[homotopy limit]] over a cosimplicial diagram in [[SSet]]).

**Warning.** The same warning as at [[regular epimorphism]] applies: with this definition of regular monomorphism in an [[(∞,1)-category]] these may fail to satisfy various definitions of plain monomorphisms that one might think of.

## Idea

The __wedge sum__ $A \vee B$ of two [[pointed sets]] $A$ and $B$ is the [[quotient set]] of the [[disjoint union]] $A \uplus B$ where both copies of the basepoint (the one in $A$ and the one in $B$) are identified.  The wedge sum $A \vee B$ can be identified with a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $A \times B$; if this subset is collapsed to a point, then the result is the [[smash product]] $A \wedge B$.

The wedge sum can be generalised to [[pointed objects]] in any category $C$ with [[pushouts]], and is the [[coproduct]] in the category of pointed objects in $C$ (which is the [[coslice category]] $*/C$).  A very commonly used case is when $C=$[[Top]] is a category of [[topological spaces]].

In particular, if $C$ itself is a [[pointed category]], then every object is uniquely a pointed object, so that the coproduct in $C$ itself may be called a _wedge sum_.  A commonly used case is when $C=$[[Spectra]] is a category of [[spectra]].

Also, the wedge sum also makes sense for any [[family]] of pointed objects, not just for two of them, as long as $C$ has pushouts of that size.

###### Definition

For $\{x_i \colon * \to X_i\}_i$ a set of [[pointed objects]] in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, their _wedge sum_ $\bigvee_i X_i$ is the [[pushout]] in $\mathcal{C}$

$$
  \bigvee_i X_i \coloneqq (\coprod_i X_i) \coprod_{\coprod_{i} *} *
$$

in 

$$
  \array{
     \coprod_{i} * &\stackrel{(x_i)}{\to}& \coprod_i X_i
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     * &\to& \bigvee_i X_i
  }
  \,,
$$

if this exists.
=--

Equivalently (see at [overcategory -- limits and colimits](overcategory#LimitsAndColimits)) this is just the [[coproduct]] in the [[undercategory]] $\mathcal{C}\backslash\ast$ of [[pointed objects]].


## Examples

* A wedge sum of pointed [[circles]] is also called a **bouquet** of circles. See for instance at _[[Nielsen-Schreier theorem]]_.

* For $X$ a [[CW complex]] with [[filtered topological space]] structure $X_0 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow \X_k \hookrightarrow X_{k+1} \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X$ the quotient topological spaces $X_{k+1}/X_k$ are wedge sums of $(k+1)$-spheres.

## Idea

In [[homotopy theory]], the _cone_ of a [[space]] $X$ is the space obtained by taking the $X$-shaped [[cylinder object|cylinder]] $X \times I$, where $I$ may be an [[interval object]], and squashing one end down to a point.  The eponymous example is where $X$ is the [[circle]], i.e. the [[topological space]] $S^1$, and $I$ is the standard interval $[0,1]$.  Then the [[cartesian product]] $X \times I$ really is a [[cylinder]], and the cone of $X$ is likewise a cone.

This notion also makes sense when $X$ is a [[category]], if $I$ is taken to be the [[interval category]] $\{ 0 \to 1 \}$, i.e. the [[ordinal]] $\mathbf{2}$.  Note that since the interval category is directed, this gives two different kinds of cone, depending on which end we squash down to a point.

Another, perhaps more common, meaning of 'cone' in category theory is that of a _cone over (or under) a [[diagram]]_.  This is just a [[diagram]] over the cone category, as above.  Explicitly, a cone over $F\colon J \to C$ is an [[object]] $c$ in $C$ equipped with a [[morphism]] from $c$ to each vertex of $F$, such that every *new* triangle arising in this way [[commutative triangle|commutes]].  A cone which is [[universal property|universal]] is a [[limit]].

In [[category theory]], the word _[[cocone]]_ is sometimes used for the case when we squash the other end of the interval; thus $c$ is equipped with a morphism *to* $c$ *from* each vertex of $F$ (but $c$ itself still belongs to $C$).  A cocone in this sense which is universal is a [[colimit]].  However, one should beware that in homotopy theory, the word [[mapping cocone|cocone]] is used for a different dualization.

This definition generalizes to [[higher category theory]]. In particular in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] a cone over an [[∞-groupoid]] is essentially a cone in the sense of [[homotopy theory]].


## Definition

### In homotopy theory

If $X$ is a space, then the cone of $X$ is the [[homotopy pushout]]
of the identity on $X$ along the unique map to the point:

$$
\array{
  X & \to & X \\
  \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
  * & \to & cone(X)
}\,.
$$

This homotopy pushout can be computed as the ordinary [[pushout]] $cone(X) := X\times I \amalg_X *$

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{d_1}{\to} & X \times I
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& cone(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

If $X$ is a [[simplicial set]], then the cone of $X$ is the [[join of simplicial sets|join]] of $X$ with the point.

The [[mapping cone]] (q.v.) of a morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ is then the pushout along $f$ of the inclusion $X \to cone(X)$.


### As a monad 

In contexts where [[intervals]] $I$ can be treated as [[monoid]] objects, the cone construction as quotient of a cylinder with one end identified with a point, 

$$C(X) = I \times X/(0 \times X) \sim p,$$ 

carries a structure of [[monad]] $C$. In such cases, the monoid has a multiplicative [[identity]] $1$ and an absorbing element $0$, where multiplication by $0$ is the constant map at $0$. In that case, a $C$-algebra consists of an object $X$ together with 

* An [[action]] of the monoid, $a: I \times X \to X$. 

* A constant or basepoint $x_0 \colon 1 \to X$ 

such that $a(0, x) = x_0$ for all $x$. This equation can be expressed in any category $\mathbf{C}$ with finite products and a suitable interval object $I$ as monoid (for example, $Top$, where $I = [0, 1]$ is a monoid under real multiplication, or under $min$ as multiplication). Under some reasonable assumptions (e.g., if the $\mathbf{C}$ has quotients, and these are preserved by the functor $I \times -$), the category of $C$-algebras will be monadic over $\mathbf{C}$ and the free $C$-algebra on $X$ will be $C(X)$ as described above. The category of $C$-algebras will also be monadic over the category of pointed $\mathbf{C}$-objects, $1 \downarrow \mathbf{C}$. 

These observations apply for example to $Top$, and also to $Cat$ where the [[interval category]] $\mathbf{2}$ is a monoid in $Cat$ under the $min$ operation (see below). 

If in addition the underlying category $\mathbf{C}$ is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], or more generally if $I$ is [[exponentiable object|exponentiable]], the monad $C$ on pointed $\mathbf{C}$-objects also has a [[right adjoint]] $P$ which can be regarded as a [[path space]] construction $P$, where we have a pullback 

$$\array{
P(X) & \to & 1 \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
X^I & \stackrel{eval_0}{\to} & X.
}$$ 

For general abstract reasons, the right adjoint $P$ carries a comonad structure whereby $C$-algebras are equivalent to $P$-coalgebras. Considered over the category of simplicial sets, this is closely connected to [[decalage]]. 

### In category theory

If $C$ is a category, then the cone of $C$ is the [[cocomma category]] of the identity on $C$ and the unique map to the [[terminal category]]:

$$
\array{
  C & \to & C \\
  \downarrow & \Rightarrow  & \downarrow \\
  * & \to & cone(C)
}\,.
$$

Again, this may be computed as a pushout:

$$
  \array{
    C &\stackrel{d_1}{\to} & C \times \mathbf{2}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& cone(C)
  }
  \,.
$$

The cone of $C$ may equivalently be thought of, or defined, as the result of adjoining a new [[initial object]] to $C$.

### Cones over a diagram

A cone *in* a category $C$ is given by a category $J$ together with a [[functor]] $cone(J) \to C$.  By the [[universal property]] of the cocomma category, to give such a functor is to give an object $c$ of $C$, a functor $F \colon J \to C$, and a [[natural transformation]]
$$T: \Delta(c) \to F$$ 
where $\Delta(c):J\to C$ denotes the [[constant functor]] at the object $c$.  Such a transformation is called a _cone over the diagram_ $F$.

In other words, a cone consists of morphisms (called the **components** of the cone) 

$$T_j: c \to F(j),$$

one for each object $j$ of $J$, which are compatible with all the morphisms $F(f): F(j) \to F(k)$ of the diagram, in the sense that each diagram 
$$\array{
{}&{}&c&{}&{} \\
{}& \mathllap{\scriptsize{T_j}}\swarrow &{}& \searrow\mathrlap{\scriptsize{T_k}} &{}  \\
F(j) &{}&\stackrel{F(f)}{\longrightarrow} &{}& F(k) \\
}
$$
commutes.

It's called a cone because one pictures $c$ as sitting at the vertex, and the diagram itself as forming the base of the cone. 

A [[cocone]] in $C$ is precisely a cone in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.


### Over a diagram in an $(\infty,1)$-category

For $F : D \to C$ a [[diagram]] of [[(∞,1)-categories]], i.e. an [[(∞,1)-functor]], the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-cones over $F$ is the [[over quasi-category]] denoted $C_{/F}$. Its objects are cones over $F$. Its [[k-morphism]]s are $k$-homotopies between cones. The [[limit in a quasi-category|(∞,1)-categorical limit]] over $F$ is, if it exists, the [[terminal object]] in $C_{/F}$.


## See also

These are shaped like the homotopy-theoretic cone, so maybe there is a deeper relationship:

* [[positive cone]] (in an [[ordered group]], such as an [[operator algebra]]),
* [[future cone]] (of an [[event]] in a [[Lorentzian manifold]], such as [[spacetime]]),
* [[convex cone]] (in a [[vector space]]).

## Idea

Loosely speaking, the **boundary** of a subset $S$ of topological space $X$ consists of those points in $X$ that are neither 'fully in' $S$ nor are 'fully not in' $S$.

## Definition

### Of a subset of a topological space

For $S \subset X$ a [[subset]] of a [[topological space]] $X$, the **boundary** or **frontier** $\partial S$ of $S$ is its [[closure]] $\bar S$ minus its [[interior]] $S^\circ$:

$$
  \partial S = \bar S \backslash S^\circ
$$

Letting $\neg$ denote set-theoretic complementation, $\partial S = \neg (S^\circ \cup (\neg S)^\circ)$. It is a closed set. If we consider $\partial$ restricted to closed sets as an operation on closed sets, then it becomes a special case of the boundary operator on a [[co-Heyting algebra]]; see there for further properties. 

### Of a manifold

In a [[manifold with boundary]] of [[dimension]] $n$ the boundary is the collection of points which do not have a [[neighborhood]] diffeomorphic to an [[open n-ball]], but do have a neighborhood homeomorphic to a half-ball, that is, an open ball intersected with closed half-space.

## Properties 

### General

One reason behind the notation $\partial$ may be this (cf. [[co-Heyting boundary]]): 

+-- {: .num_prop #Leibniz} 
###### Proposition 
Let $X, Y$ be topological spaces. Then for closed subsets $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$, the [[Leibniz rule]] $\partial (A \times B) = (\partial A \times B) \cup (A \times \partial B)$ holds. 
=-- 

Notice the conclusion *must* fail if $A$, $B$ are *not* closed, since in this case $(\partial A \times B) \cup (A \times \partial B)$ is not closed (it doesn't include $\partial A \times \partial B$). 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The interior operation preserves intersections, so $(A \times B)^\circ = ((A \times Y) \cap (X \times B))^\circ = (A^\circ \times Y) \cap (X \times B^\circ)$. Its complement is $(\neg A^\circ \times Y) \cup (X \times \neg B^\circ)$, whose intersection with $\widebar{A \times B} = A \times B$ is $(\partial A \times B) \cup (A \times \partial B)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
If $A, B$ are [[connected space|connected]] open subsets of $X$ and $A \cap B$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], then $\partial A = \partial B$ implies $A = B$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Since $B$ is open, we have 

$$B \subseteq \neg \partial B = \neg \partial A = A^\circ \cup (\neg A)^\circ,$$ 

where the right side is a disjoint union of open sets. $B$ is connected, so $B \subseteq A^\circ$ or $B \subseteq (\neg A)^\circ \subseteq \neg A$. The latter cannot occur since $A \cap B$ is inhabited. So $B \subseteq A^\circ \subseteq A$; by symmetry $A \subseteq B$. 
=-- 

### Collar neighbourhood theorem

For [[topological manifolds]] and [[smooth manifolds]] [[manifold with boundary|with boudnary]], see: _[[collar neighbourhood theorem]]_.

## Some ramifications

The [Leibniz rule](#Leibniz) shows that the boundary operator is better behaved when restricted to the lattice of [[closed subspace|closed subsets]]. Since this lattice forms a [[co-Heyting algebra]], one is led to study algebraic operators axiomatizing properties of $\partial$ ([Zarycki 1927](#Zar27)) on these, the so called [[co-Heyting boundary]] operators.

Since the [[lattice of subtoposes]] of a given [[topos]] carries a co-Heyting algebra structure, it becomes possible to define (co-Heyting) boundaries of subtoposes and thereby even boundaries of the [[geometric theory|geometric theories]] that the subtoposes correspond to! Intuitively, such a boundary $\partial T$ of a theory $T$ consists of those geometric sequents that neither 'fully follow' from $T$ nor 'fully contradict' $T$.

The interior $Int(\mathcal{E}_j)$ of a subtopos $\mathcal{E}_j$ of a [[Grothendieck topos]] is defined in an exercise of [SGA4](#SGA4) as the largest [[open subtopos]] contained in $\mathcal{E}_j$. The boundary $\partial\mathcal{E}_j$ is then defined as the subtopos complementary to the (open) join of the [[dense subtopos|exterior subtopos]] $Ext(\mathcal{E}_j)$ and $Int(\mathcal{E}_j)$ in the [[lattice of subtoposes]].

The co-Heyting algebra perspective and the accompanying _mereo-logic of theories_ was proposed by [[William Lawvere]]. See the references at [[co-Heyting boundary]] for further pointers!

## Definition

A [[function]] $f$ (of sets) from $A$ to $B$ is __surjective__ if, given any element $y$ of $B$, $y = f(x)$ for some $x$.  A surjective function is also called __onto__ or a __surjection__. 

Surjections are the same as [[epimorphisms]] in [[Set|the category of sets]] and [[effective epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category|effective epimorphisms]] in [[Set|the (infinity,1)-category of sets]]. 

A _[[bijection]]_ is a function that is both [[surjection|surjective]] and [[injection|injective]].

## The surjection preorder

In [[classical mathematics|classical]] [[set theory]], one writes $|B| \leq^* |A|$ to mean that either there is a surjection $A \to B$ *or* $B=\empty$. The relation $\leq^*$ is a [[preorder]] on the class of all sets, and its restriction to [[inhabited]] sets is the preorder reflection of the category $Surj_{inh}$ of inhabited sets and surjections.

To make this definition less piecemeal and more constructive, one can define $|B| \leq^* |A|$ to mean $B$ is a [[subquotient]] of $A$, in other words one has a surjection $B' \to B$ and an injection $B' \to A$. For $B$ inhabited and a subquotient of $A$, [[excluded middle]] implies there is a surjection from $A$ to $B$, so in [[classical mathematics]] this coincides with the piecemeal definition.

Contrast with the notation $|B| \leq |A|$ if there is an [[injection]] $B\to A$.  Since subobjects are subquotients (e.g. we can take $B'=B$ above), $|B| \leq |A|$ implies $|B| \leq^* |A|$.  (If we wanted to prove this using the piecemeal definition, we would require excluded middle.)

## Axioms of choice

The [[axiom of choice]] states precisely that every surjection in the category of sets has a [[section]]. Thus in this setting one has: $|B| \leq^* |A|$ implies $|B| \leq |A|$, and so $|B| \leq^* |A|$ iff $|B| \leq |A|$ assuming AC. Some authors who doubt the axiom of choice use the term 'onto' for a surjection as defined above and reserve 'surjective' for the stronger notion of a function with a section (a [[split epimorphism]]). 

The axiom [[WISC]] has an equivalent statement (that works in any Boolean [[topos]]) due to Fran&#231;ois Dorais phrased almost entirely in terms of surjections (or epimorphisms): 

>For every set $X$ there is a set $Y$ such that for every surjection $q\colon Z \to X$ there is a function $s\colon Y \to Z$ such that $q\circ s\colon Y\to X$ is a surjection.

One can view this as really a statement about the [[Grothendieck fibration]] over [[Set]] with fibre over $X$ the full subcategory of $Set/X$ on the surjections: every fibre has a [[weakly initial object]].

## In other categories
Since an element $a$ in a set $A$ in the [[category of sets]] is just a [[global element]] $a:1\rightarrow A$, one could define surjections in any category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$ is called a __surjection__. a __surjective morphism__, or an __onto morphism__ if, given any global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, there exists a global element $x:1\rightarrow A$ such that $y = f \circ x$. 
=--

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
Some authors regard surjection as a synonym of [[split epimorphism]], and only use 'onto' for the definition above. 
=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$, the unique morphism $!:A\rightarrow 1$ is a surjection for every object $A$. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
By definition of a terminal object, for every object $A$ there exists a unique morphism $!:A\rightarrow 1$, and the identity morphism is the unique global element $1_{1}:1\rightarrow 1$. The composite of a global element $x:1\rightarrow A$ with the function $!:A\rightarrow 1$ results in a function $! \circ x:1\rightarrow 1$, which by definition of a terminal object is the same as $1_{1}:1\rightarrow 1$. Since $! \circ x = 1_{1}$, for every object $A$, $!:A\rightarrow 1$ is a surjection. 
=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
In a category of [[pointed object]]s $\mathcal{C}$, every morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ is a surjection for every object $A$. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
A pointed object in a category with terminal objects is a object $A$ with a global element $a:1\rightarrow A$ to the object, and morphisms in the category preserve the global element, which means there is only a unique global element for each object $A$. Therefore, for every morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ and global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, there exists a global element $x:1\rightarrow A$ such that $y = f \circ x$. 
=--

Just because a morphism is a surjection in a concrete category does not mean that the morphism in the underlying category of sets is a surjection; equivalently, the [[forgetful functor]] from any category $\mathcal{C}$ to Set does not preserve surjections. 

### Well-pointedness
The fact that surjections are epimorphisms in [[Set]] is a result of the fact that Set is well-pointed. This could be generalised to any category with a terminal separator $1$. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$ such that $1$ is a [[separator]], every surjection is an [[epimorphism]]. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
For any surjection $f:A\rightarrow B$, suppose there are parallel morphisms $g, h:B\rightarrow C$ such that there $g \circ f = h \circ f$ (a [[fork]]). Then for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$ there exists a global element $x:1\rightarrow A$ such that $y = f \circ x$, and thus $g \circ y = g \circ f \circ x$ and $h \circ y = h \circ f \circ x$. But since $g \circ f = h \circ f$, $g \circ f \circ x = h \circ f \circ x$, which implies that $g \circ y = h \circ y$. Since $1$ is a [[separator]], then for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, if $g \circ y = h \circ y$, then $g = h$. Therefore, every surjection is an epimorphism. 
=--

### Axiom of choice

The axiom of choice for surjections in [[Set]] is the following statement: 

* Every [[surjection]] is a [[split epimorphism]]. 

This axiom could be defined in every category with a terminal object, and could be contrasted with the axiom of choice for epimorphisms, as not every epimorphism is an surjection, nor is every surjection an epimorphism. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$ and binary [[equalisers]] such that every [[surjection]] is a [[split epimorphism]], the terminal object $1$ is a [[separator]]. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Suppose there are parallel morphisms $g, h:B\rightarrow C$ such that for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, $g \circ y = h \circ y$. One could construct an equaliser $f:eq(g,h)\rightarrow B$, which implies that $g \circ f = h \circ f$ and that for any global element $x:1\rightarrow eq(g,h)$, $g \circ f \circ x = h \circ f \circ x$. This implies that for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, there exists a global element $x:1\rightarrow eq(g,h)$ where $y = f \circ x$, and the equaliser $f:eq(g,h)\rightarrow B$ is a surjection. Since every surjection is a [[split epimorphism]], $f$ has a section $i:B\rightarrow eq(g,h)$ such that $f \circ i = 1_{B}$, the identity morphism on $B$, $g \circ f \circ i = h \circ f \circ i$, $g \circ 1_{B} = h \circ 1_{B}$, and $g = f$. Because for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, $g \circ y = h \circ y$ implies $g = h$, the terminal object $1$ is a [[separator]].

## Idea
An element $x$ in a [[ring]] (or potentially even a [[nonassociative algebra|nonassociative]] [[rig]]) $A$ is __nilpotent__ if there exist a natural number $n$ such that $x^n = 0$. 

An ring/rig/algebra is __nilpotent__ if there exists a uniform number $n$ such that any product of $n$ elements is $0$. An algebra over a [[field]] is __locally nilpotent__ if all of its finitely-generated subalgebras are nilpotent. A [[Lie algebra]] element is __[[ad-nilpotent Lie algebra|ad-nilpotent]]__ if the multiplication with any of its elements is a nilpotent linear operator. A Lie algebra $A$ is __nilpotent__ iff its [[lower central series]] $A, [A,A], [A,[A,A]], \ldots, [A,[A,[A,\ldots,[A,A]\cdots]]], \ldots$ terminates with $0$ after finitely many steps. By Engel's theorem ([English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_theorem)) a finite-dimensional Lie algebra is nilpotent iff it is locally nilpotent. Thus sometimes locally nilpotent Lie algebras are called __Engel's Lie algebras__. 

The class of locally nilpotent [[associative algebras]] is closed under extensions (defined in the category of associative algebras).  Consequently associative algebras have a largest nilpotent ideal (namely the sum of all locally nilpotent ideals), which is called __Levitskii radical__. 

The structure rings of classical [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] are finitely generated [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] commutative associative unital rings _without nilpotent elements_. One of the principal advantages of Grothendieck's theory of [[schemes]] is to allow for nilpotent elements in [[local rings]]. A scheme is [[reduced scheme|reduced]] if there are no nilpotent elements in stalks of the structure sheaf.

## Idea
 {#Idea}

The notion of _topological space_ aims to axiomatize the idea of a _[[space]]_ as a collection of [[points]] that hang together ("[[cohesive topos|cohere]]") in a _[[continuous function|continuous]]_ way.

Some one-dimensional shapes with different topologies: the Mercedes-Benz symbol, a line, a circle, a complete graph with 5 nodes, the skeleton of a cube, and an asterisk (or, if you'll permit the one-dimensional approximation, a starfish). A circle has the same topology as a line segment with a wormhole at its finish which teleports you to its start. You can see this by putting overlapping open intervals on each of the shapes. You'll see that they respond the same way, so they're equivalent in that sense.

The surface of a [[torus]] is also topologically equivalent to the surface of a mug. You can see this by putting open circles or slightly looser loops all over each surface: you'll see that they also respond in the same way. Abstractly, the surface of the mug can be deformed _continuously_ to become the standard torus: the continuous cohesion among the collections of points of the two surfaces is the same.

There is a slight generalization of the notion of topological space to that of a _[[locale]]_, which consists of dropping the assumption that all [[neighbourhoods]] are explicitly or even necessarily supported by points. In this form the definition is quite fundamental and can be naturally motivated from just pure [[logic]] -- as the formal dual of _[[frames]]_ --  as well as, and [[duality|dually]], from [[category theory]] in its variant as [[topos theory]] -- by the notion of _[[(0,1)-toposes]]_. 

Topological spaces are the objects studied in _[[topology]]_. 
By equipping them with a notion of [[weak equivalence]], namely of [[weak homotopy equivalence]], they turn out to support also _[[homotopy theory]]_. 

Topological spaces equipped with extra [[property]] and [[structure]] form the fundament of much of [[geometry]]. For instance a topological space locally isomorphic to a [[Cartesian space]] is a _[[manifold]]_. A topological space equipped with a notion of [[smooth functions]] into it is a [[diffeological space]]. The intersection of these two notions is that of a _[[smooth manifold]]_ on which [[differential geometry]] is based. And so on.

### Standard definition
 {#StandardDefinition}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **topological space** is a [[set]] $X$ equipped with a set of [[subsets]] 
$U \subset X$, called the **[[open sets]]**, which are closed under 

1. finite [[intersections]] 
1. arbitrary [[unions]].  

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The word 'topology' sometimes means the [[topology|study of topological spaces]] but here it means the collection of open sets in a topological space. In particular, if someone says 'Let $T$ be a topology on $X$', then they mean 'Let $X$ be equipped with the structure of a topological space, and let $T$ be the collection of open sets in this space'.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Since $X$ itself is the intersection of zero subsets, it is open, and since the [[empty set]] $\emptyset$ is the union of zero subsets, it is also open. Moreover, every open subset $U$ of $X$ contains the empty set and is contained in $X$

$$
  \emptyset \subset U \subset X
  \,,
$$

so that the topology of $X$ is determined by a [[poset of open subsets]] $Op(X)$ with [[bottom]] element $\bot = \emptyset$ and [[top]] element $\top = X$. 

Since by definition the elements in this [[poset]] are closed under finite [[meets]] (intersection) and arbitrary [[joins]] (unions), this poset of open subsets defining a topology is a _[[frame]]_, the _[[frame of opens]]_ of $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[homomorphism]] between topological spaces $f : X \to Y$ is a **[[continuous function]]**: 

a [[function]] $f:X\to Y$ of the underlying [[sets]] such that the [[preimage]] of every open set of $Y$ is an open set of $X$.

=--

Topological spaces with continuous maps between them form a [[category]], usually denoted _[[Top]]_.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The definition of [[continuous function]] $f : X \to Y$ is such that it induces a homomorphism of the corresponding [[frames of opens]] the other way around

$$
  Op(X) \leftarrow Op(Y) : f^{-1}
  \,.
$$

And this is not just a morphism of [[posets]] but even of [[frames]].
For more on this see at _[[locale]]_.

=--

### Alternate equivalent definitions
 {#AlternateDefinitions}

There are many equivalent ways to define a topological space.  A non-exhaustive list follows:

* A set $X$ with a [[frame]] of open sets (as above).

* A set $X$ with a co-frame of [[closed sets]] (the complements of the open sets) satisfying dual axioms.

* A set $X$ with any collection of subsets whatsoever, to be thought of as a [[subbase]] for a topology.

* A pair $(X, int)$, where $int\colon P(X) \to P(X)$ is a [[lex functor|left exact]] [[comonad]] on the [[power set]] of $X$ (the "[[interior]] operator").  The open sets are exactly the fixed points of $int$.

* A pair $(X, cl)$ where $cl$ is a [[rex functor|right exact]] [[Moore closure]] operator satisfying axioms dual to those of $int$.  The closed sets are the fixed points of $cl$.

* A [[relational beta-module]]; that is, a [[lax algebra]] of the [[monad]] $\beta$ of [[ultrafilters]] on the [[(1,2)-category]] [[Rel]] of sets and [[binary relations]].  More explicitly, this means a set $X$ together with a relation called "[[convergence]]" between ultrafilters and points satisfying certain axioms.  This exhibits it as a special sort of [[generalized multicategory]], and also as a special sort of [[pseudotopological space]].

* A set with a [[convergence relation]] between [[nets]] or [[filters]] (not just ultrafilters) and points, or even between transfinite [[sequences]] and points, satisfying appropriate axioms.


### Variations
 {#Variants}

The definition of topological space was a matter of some debate, especially about 100 years ago. Our definition is due to [[Bourbaki]], so may be called **Bourbaki spaces**.

For some purposes, including [[homotopy theory]], it is important to use [[nice topological spaces]] (such as [[sequential topological spaces]]) and/or a [[nice category of spaces|nice-]] or [[convenient category of topological spaces]]  (such as [[compactly generated spaces]]), or indeed to directly use a model of $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] (such as [[simplicial sets]]).

On the other hand, when doing [[topos theory]] or working in [[constructive mathematics]], it is often more appropriate to use [[locales]] than topological spaces.

Some applications to [[analysis]] require more general [[convergence spaces]] or other generalisations.

## Idea ##

In [[topology]], a _neighbourhood_ (or _neighborhood_) of a [[point]] $x$ in some [[topological space]] $X$ is a [[subset]] $U$ such that there is enough room around $x$ in $U$ to move in any direction (but perhaps not very far).  One writes $x \in U^\circ$, $U \stackrel{\circ}\ni x$, or any of the six other obvious variations to indicate that $U$ is a neighbourhood of $x$.


## Definitions ##

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and $x \in X$ a point. Then:

1. A [[subset]] $U \subset X$ is a __neighbourhood__ of $x$ if there exists an [[open subset]] $O \subset X$ such that $x \in O$ and $O \subset U$.

1. A [[subset]] $U \subset X$ is an __open neighbourhood__ of $x$ if it is both an [[open subset]] and a neighbourhood of $x$;

Beware, some authors use "neighbourhood" as a synonym for "open neighbourhood".

Similarly one says that a _closed neighbourhood_ or _compact neighbourhood_ etc. is a neighbourhood that is also a [[closed subset]] or [[compact subspace]], respectively.


## Properties ##

* When definitions of topological concepts are given in terms of neighbourhoods, it often makes no difference if the neighbourhoods are required to be open or not.  There should be some deep logical reason for this ....

* The neighbourhoods of a given point form a proper [[filter]], the __neighbourhood filter__ of that point.  A __local (sub)[[base]]__ for the topology at that point is a (sub)base for that filter.


* The concept of [[topological space]] can be defined by taking the neighbourhood relation as primitive.  One axiom is more complicated than the others; if it is dropped, then the result is the definition of [[pretopological space]].

# Zero-divisors
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

A zero-divisor is something that, like [[zero]] itself, when [[multiplication|multiplied]] by something possibly nonzero still produces zero as a product.


## Definitions

Let $M$ be a [[absorption monoid]] (such as a [[commutative ring]] or any [[ring]]).

An element $x$ of $M$ is a __non-zero-divisor__ if, whenever $x \cdot y = 0$ or $y \cdot x = 0$, then $y = 0$.  An element $x$ is a __zero-divisor__ if there exists $y \ne 0$ such that $x \cdot y = 0$ or $y x = 0$.

In [[constructive mathematics]], we want $\ne$ to be a [[tight apartness relation]] on $M$ in the definition of zero-divisor.  We also say that $x$ is a __strong non-zero-divisor__ if, whenever $y \ne 0$, then $x y \ne 0$ and $y x \ne 0$.  (The notion of (weak) non-zero-divisor makes sense even without any apartness relation.)

If $M$ is (or may be) non-commutative, then we may distinguish __left__ and __right__ (non)-zero-divisors in the usual way.

## Properties

By this definition, [[zero]] itself is a zero-divisor if and only if $M$ is non-trivial.  (Some authorities will differ on this point, but if you think about it, this is clearly the correct definition, by the same principle that the trivial ring is not a field, $1$ is not a prime number, etc.  See [[too simple to be simple]].)

An [[integral domain]] is precisely a commutative ring (whose multiplicative monoid is an absorption monoid by definition) in which [[zero]] is the unique zero-divisor of the multiplicative monoid of the commutative ring (or constructively, in which the strong non-zero-divisors are precisely the strong non-zero elements in the multiplicative monoid, that is those elements $x$ such that $x \ne 0$).

The non-zero-divisors of any absorption monoid $M$ form a [[monoid]] under multiplication, which may be denoted $M^{\times}$.  Note that if $M$ happens to be a [[field]], then this $M^{\times}$ agrees with the usual notation $M^{\times}$ for the [[group]] of invertible elements of the multiplicative monoid $M$, but $M^{\times}$ is not a group in general.  (We may use $M^{\div}$ or $M^*$ for the group of invertible elements.)

## Generalisations

If $I$ is any [[ideal of a monoid|ideal]] of $M$, then we can generalise from a zero-divisor to an $I$-[[divisor]].  In a way, this is nothing new; $x$ is an $I$-divisor in $M$ if and only if $[x]$ is a zero-divisor in $M/I$.  Ultimately, this is related to the notion of [[divisor]] in [[algebraic geometry]].

## Definition

### In set theory

Given [[sets]] $A$ and $B$ and a [[function]] $f\colon A \to B$, the __inverse function__ of $f$ (if it exists) is the function $f^{-1}\colon B \to A$ such that both [[composition|composite functions]] $f \circ f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1} \circ f$ are [[identity functions]].  Note that $f$ has an inverse function if and only if $f$ is a [[bijection]], in which case this inverse function is unique.

Inverse functions are [[inverse morphisms]] in the [[category]] [[Set]] of sets.

More generally, in any [[concrete category]], the inverse of any [[isomorphism]] is given by the inverse of the corresponding function between [[underlying sets]].

### In type theory

In [[type theory]], there are two different kinds of inverse functions, quasi-inverse functions, various kinds of more or less coherent quasi-inverse functions, and inverse functions. 

For more on this see at *[[equivalence in type theory]]*.

#### Quasi-inverse functions

Given [[types]] $A$ and $B$ and a [[function]] $f:A \to B$, a __quasi-inverse function__ of $f$ is a function $g:B \to A$ such that $g$ is a [[retraction]] and a [[section]] of $f$. 

$$\prod_{b:B} (f(g(b)) =_B b) \times \prod_{a:A} (a =_A g(f(a)))$$

Equivalently, there are functions $\epsilon_0(a, b):(a =_A g(b)) \to (f(a) =_B b)$ and $\eta_0(a, b):(f(a) =_B b) \to (a =_A g(b))$ for all $a:A$ and $b:B$. 

$$\prod_{a:A} \prod_{b:B} ((a =_A g(b)) \to (f(a) =_B b)) \times ((f(a) =_B b) \to (a =_A g(b)))$$

A function $f:A \to B$ might have multiple quasi-inverse functions. The type of quasi-inverses of $f$ is given by 

$$\mathrm{QuasiInv}(f) \coloneqq \sum_{g:B \to A} \prod_{b:B} (f(g(b)) =_B b) \times \prod_{a:A} (a =_A g(f(a)))$$

#### $n$-quasi inverse functions

There are also variants of quasi-inverse functions where they are the inverse functions for $n$-truncated types. 

For example, every function $g:B \to A$ is a (-1)-quasi inverse function, because it is an inverse function for [[h-propositions]] $A$ and $B$. 

A quasi-inverse function is a 0-quasi inverse function, because it is an inverse function for [[h-sets]] $A$ and $B$. 

A 1-quasi-inverse function is a quasi-inverse function with functions $\epsilon_0(a, b):(a =_A g(b)) \to (f(a) =_B b)$ and $\eta_0(a, b):(f(a) =_B b) \to (a =_A g(b))$ for all $a:A$ and $b:B$ such that for all $c:a =_A g(b)$ and $d:f(a) =_B b$, 
there are functions
$$\epsilon_1(a, b, c, d):(\epsilon_0(a, b, c) =_{f(a) =_B b} d) \to (c =_{a =_A g(b)} \eta_0(a, b, d))$$
$$\eta_1(a, b, c, d):(c =_{a =_A g(b)} \eta_0(a, b, d)) \to (\epsilon_0(a, b, c) =_{f(a) =_B b} d)$$
This is an inverse function for [[h-groupoids]] $A$ and $B$. 

So on and so forth. 

#### Inverse functions

Given [[types]] $A$ and $B$ and a [[function]] $f:A \to B$, an __inverse function__ of $f$ is a function $g:B \to A$ with a function $\epsilon(a, b):(f(a) =_B b) \to (a =_A g(b))$ for all $a:A$ and $b:B$, such that for all identities $p:a =_A g(b)$, the fiber of $\epsilon(a, b)$ at $p$ is contractible. 

$$\mathrm{isInv}(f, g) \coloneqq \prod_{a:A} \prod_{b:B} \sum_{\epsilon(a, b):(f(a) =_B b) \to (a =_A g(b))} \prod_{p:a =_A g(b)} \mathrm{isContr}(\mathrm{fiber}(\epsilon(a, b), p))$$

#### Coherent inverse functions

Given [[types]] $A$ and $B$ and a [[function]] $f:A \to B$, a __coherent inverse function__ of $f$ is a quasi-inverse function $g:B \to A$ with [[homotopies]] 

$$G:\prod_{x:B} f(g(x)) =_B x \qquad H:\prod_{x:A} g(f(x)) =_A x$$

which additionally has [[homotopies]]
$$K_f:\prod_{x:A} \mathrm{ap}_f(H(x)) =_{g(f(x)) =_A x} G(f(x)) \qquad K_g:\prod_{x:B} H(g(x)) =_{f(g(x)) =_B x} \mathrm{ap}_g(G(x)) $$

The type of coherent inverse functions of $f$ is given by the type

$$\mathrm{CohInv}(f) \coloneqq \sum_{g:B \to A} \sum_{G:\prod_{x:B} f(g(x)) =_B x} \sum_{H:\prod_{x:A} g(f(x)) =_A x} \left(\prod_{x:A} \mathrm{ap}_f(H(x)) =_{g(f(x)) =_A x} G(f(x))\right) \times \left(\prod_{x:B} H(g(x)) =_{f(g(x)) =_B x} \mathrm{ap}_g(G(x))\right)$$

## Properties

Given a function $f:A \to B$ and a function $g:B \to A$, there are functions 
$$G:\prod_{x:B} f(g(x)) =_B x, H:\prod_{x:A} (g(f(x)) =_A x) \vdash \mathrm{QInvToCohInv}_1(f, g)(G, H):\prod_{x:A} \mathrm{ap}_f(H(x)) =_{g(f(x)) =_A x} G(f(x))$$
$$G:\prod_{x:B} f(g(x)) =_B x, H:\prod_{x:A} (g(f(x)) =_A x) \vdash \mathrm{QInvToCohInv}_2(f, g)(G, H):\prod_{x:B} H(g(x)) =_{f(g(x)) =_B x} \mathrm{ap}_g(G(x))$$

which satisfies the [[commutative squares]] for all elements $a:A$ and $b:B$

$$
  \array{& f(g(f(g(b)))) & \overset{G(f(g(b))}= & f(g(b)) & \\
          \mathrm{ap}_{f}(H(g(b)))) & \Vert & =_{f(g(f(g(b)))) =_B b} & \Vert & \pi_1(\mathrm{QInvToCohInv}_1(f, g)(G, H))(b) \\
          & f(g(b)) & \underset{G(b)}= & b & \\
}$$

$$
  \array{& g(f(g(f(a)))) & \overset{H(g(f(a))}= & g(f(a)) & \\
          \mathrm{ap}_{g}(G(f(a)))) & \Vert & =_{g(f(g(f(a)))) =_A a} & \Vert & \pi_1(\mathrm{QInvToCohInv}_2(f, g)(G, H))(a) \\
          & g(f(a)) & \underset{H(a)}= & a & \\
}$$

## Idea

For a [[category]] $C$, its _opposite category_ $C^{op}$ is the category obtained by formally reversing the direction of all its [[morphisms]] (while retaining their original composition law).

Categories generalize (are a [[horizontal categorification]] of) [[monoids]], [[groups]] and [[algebras]], and forming the opposite category corresponds to forming the opposite of a group, of a monoid, of an algebra.



## Definition

### In category theory

For a [[category]] $C$, the **opposite category** $C^{op}$ has the same [[objects]] as $C$, but a [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ in $C^{op}$ is the same as a morphism $f : y \to x$ in $C$, and a composite of morphisms $g f$ in $C^{op}$ is defined to be the composite $f g$ in $C$.

More precisely, $C_{\mathrm{obj}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{mor}}$ are, respectively, the collections of [[objects]] and of [[morphisms]] of $C$, and if the structure maps of $C$ are

* source and target: $s_C,t_C : C_{\mathrm{mor}} \to C_{\mathrm{obj}}$

* identity-assignment: $i_C : C_{\mathrm{obj}} \to C_{\mathrm{mor}}$

* composition: $\circ_C : C_{\mathrm{mor}} \times_{C_{\mathrm{obj}}} C_{\mathrm{mor}} \to C_{\mathrm{mor}}$ 

then $C^{op}$ is the category with

* the same (isomorphic) collections of objects and morphisms

  $(C^{op})_{\mathrm{obj}} := C_{\mathrm{obj}}$

  $(C^{op})_{\mathrm{mor}} := C_{\mathrm{mor}}$ 

* the same identity-assigning map

  $i_{C^{op}} := i_C$

* _switched_ source and target maps

  $s_{C^{op}} := t_C$

  $t_{C^{op}} := s_C$

* the _same_ composition operation,

  $\circ_{C^{op}} := \circ_{C}$.

  or more precisely, the composition operation of $C^{op}$ is

  $$
    \circ_{C^{op}}
    : 
    C_{\mathrm{mor}}^{op} {}_{s^{op}}\times_{t^{op}} C_{\mathrm{mor}}^{op}
    =
    C_{\mathrm{mor}} {}_{t} \times_{s} C_{\mathrm{mor}}
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    C_{\mathrm{mor}} {}_{s} \times_{t} C_{\mathrm{mor}}
    \stackrel{\circ}{\to}
    C_{\mathrm{mor}}
    \,,
  $$

  where the isomorphism in the middle is the unique one induced from the universality of the [[pullback]].

Notice that hence the composition law does _not_ change when passing to the opposite category. Only the interpretation of in which direction the arrows point does change. So forming the opposite category is a completely formal process. Nevertheless, due to the switch of source and target, the opposite category $C^{op}$ is usually far from being [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $C$. See the examples below.

If $V$ is a monoidal category, then $V^{op}$ is equivalent to $(\Sigma V)^{co}$ where $\Sigma V$ is the [[delooping]] of $V$, i.e. $V$ viewed as a one-object [[bicategory]] and ${co}$ is the [[opposite 2-category|opposite on 2-cells]]

### Opposite functors

Given [[categories]] $C$ and $D$,
the __opposite functor__ of a [[functor]] $F:C\to D$
is the functor $F^{op}:C^{op}\to D^{op}$
such that $F^{op}_{obj}=F_{obj}$ and $F^{op}_{mor}=F_{mor}$.

In the literature, $F^{op}$ is often confused with $F$.
This is unfortunate, since (for example)
[[natural transformations]] $F^{op}\to G^{op}$ (of functors $C^{op}\to D^{op}$)
can be identified with natural transformations $G\to F$ (and not $F\to G$).

### Opposite natural transformations

Given [[categories]] $C$ and $D$,
[[functors]] $F,G:C\to D$,
the __opposite natural transformation__
of a [[natural transformation]] $t:F\to G$
is the natural transformation $t^{op}:G^{op}\to F^{op}$,
induced by the same map $C_{obj}\to D_{mor}$ as $t$.

Again, in the literature $t^{op}$ is often confused with $t$.

### The oppositization 2-functor

The above three constructions of the opposite category,
opposite functor, and opposite natural transformation
combine together into the __oppositization 2-functor__
$$Cat^{co}\to Cat,$$
where $Cat^{co}$ denotes the 2-cell dual of the [[2-category]] $Cat$,
with the direction of 2-morphisms reversed
and the direction of 1-morphisms preserved.

### In enriched category theory ##

The definition has a direct generalization to  [[enriched category theory]].

For $V$ a [[symmetric monoidal category]] and $C$ a $V$-[[enriched category]] the **opposite $V$-enriched category** $C^{op}$ is defined to be the $V$-enriched category with the same objects as $C$ and with

$$
  C^{op}(c,d) := C(d,c)
$$

and composition given by

$$
  C^{op}(b,c)\otimes C^{op}(a,b)
  :=
  C(c,b) \otimes C(b,a)
  \stackrel{\sigma}{\to}
  C(b,a) \otimes C(c,b)
  \stackrel{\circ_C}{\to} 
  C_{c,a}
  =:
  C^{op}(a,c)
  \,.
$$

The unit maps $j_a : I \to C^{op}(a,a)$ are those of $C$ under the identification $C^{op}(a,a) = C(a,a)$.

Note that the [[braiding]] of $V$ is used in defining composition for $C^{op}$.  So, we cannot define the opposite of a $V$-enriched category if $V$ is merely a [[monoidal category]], though $V$-enriched categories still make perfect sense in this case.  If $V$ is a [[braided monoidal category]] there are (at least) two ways to define "$C^{op}$", resulting in two different "opposite categories": we can use either the braiding or the inverse braiding.  If $V$ is [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] these two definitions coincide.

The opposite category can be regarded as a [[dual object]] of $C$ in the [[monoidal bicategory]] $V Prof$ of $V$-categories and $V$-[[profunctors]].  (Note that this does not characterize $C^{op}$ up to equivalence, but only up to [[Morita equivalence]], i.e. up to [[Cauchy completion]].)  When $V$ is symmetric, then $V Prof$ is also symmetric monoidal, so there is only one notion of dual object.  When $V$ is braided, then $V Prof$ is not symmetric and has two notions of dual: a left dual and a right dual.  These are exactly the two different opposite categories referred to above (the "left opposite" and "right opposite").


### In higher category theory

See

* [[opposite 2-category]]

* [[opposite (∞,1)-category]]



## Properties

The [[nerve]] $N(C^{op})$ of $C^{op}$ is the [[simplicial set]] that is degreewise the same as $N(C)$, but in each degree with the order of the face and the order of the degeneracy maps reversed. See [[opposite quasi-category]] for more details.




## Classes of examples

### Opposite group
 {#OppositeGroup}

For $G = (S, \cdot)$ a [[group]] (or [[monoid]] or [[associative algebra]], etc.) with product operation

$$
  \cdot_G : S \times S \to S
$$


the **opposite group** $G^{op}$ is the group whose underlying [[set]] (underlying object, underlying vector space, etc.) is the same as that of $G$

$$
  S^{op} := S
$$

but whose product operation is that of $G$ but combined with a switch of the order of the arguments:

$$
  \cdot_{G^{op}} : S \times S \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} S \times S \stackrel{\cdot_G}{\to} S
  \,.
$$

So for $g,h \in S$ two elements we have that their product in the opposite group is

$$
  g \cdot_{G^{op}} h := h \cdot_{G} g
  \,.
$$


Now, the group $G$ may be thought of as the pointed one-object [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}G$ which is the groupoid with a single object, with $S$ as its set of morphisms, and with $\cdot_G$ its composition operation.

Under this identification of groups with one-object categories, passing to the opposite category corresponds precisely to passing to the opposite group

$$
  (\mathbf{B}G)^{op} = \mathbf{B}(G^{op})
  \,.
$$


### Opposite of the opposite

The opposite of an opposite category is the original category:

$$
  (C^{op})^{op} = C
  \,.
$$

This is also true for $V$-enriched categories when $V$ is symmetric monoidal, but not when $V$ is merely braided.  However, in the latter case we can say $(C^{op1})^{op2} = C = (C^{op2})^{op1}$, i.e. the two different notions of "opposite category" are inverse to each other (as is always the case for left and right dualization operations in a non-symmetric monoidal (bi)category).


### Co-algebraic structures

Every algebraic structure in a category, for instance the notion of [[monoid]] in a [[monoidal category]] $C$, has a co-version, where in the original definition the direction of all morphisms is reversed -- for instance the co-version of a monoid is a [[comonoid]]. Of an [[algebra]] its a [[coalgebra]], etc.

One may express this succinctly by saying that a co-structure in $C$ is an original structure in $C^{op}$. For instance a [[comonoid]] in $C$ is a [[monoid]] in $C^{op}$.


### Duality

Passing to the opposite category is a realization of abstract [[duality]]. 

This goes as far as _defining_ some entities as objects in an opposite category--in particular, all generalizations of [[geometry]] which characterize [[space and quantity|spaces]] in terms of [[algebra|algebras]]. The idea of [[noncommutative geometry]] is essentially to define a category of _spaces_ as the opposite category of a category of algebras. Similarly, a [[locale]] is opposite to a [[frame]].

+--{.query}
Are there examples where algebras are defined as dual to spaces?
=--

Another example is the definition of the category of $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroids]] as that opposite to quasi-free differential graded algebras, identifying every $L_\infty$-algebra with its [[duality|dual]] [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]].



## Specific examples

### Opposite of $Set$ and $FinSet$

The [[power set]]-[[functor]]

$$
  \mathcal{P} \;\colon\; Set^{op} \to Bool
$$

constitutes an [[equivalence of categories]] from the opposite category of [[Set]] to that of [[complete atomic Boolean algebras]]. See at _[Set -- Properties -- Opposite category and Boolean algebras](Set#OppositeCategory)_

Restricted to [[finite sets]] this says that  the opposite of the category [[FinSet]] of [[finite sets]] is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of finite [[boolean algebras]]

$$
  FinSet^{op} \simeq FinBoolAlg
  \,.
$$

See at _[FinSet -- Properties -- Opposite category](FinSet#OppositeCategory)_. See at _[[Stone duality]]_ for more.

## Definition

Let $A: H\to H$  be an [[unbounded operator]] on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$. An unbounded operator $A^*$ is its __[[adjoint operator|adjoint]]__ if

* $(A x|y) = (x|A^*y)$ for all $x\in dom(A)$ and $y\in dom(A^*)$; and
* every $B$ satisfying the above property for $A^*$ is a restriction of $A$.

An adjoint does not need to exist in general. 

An unbounded operator is **symmetric** if $dom(A)\subset dom(A^*)$ and $A x = A^*x$ for all $x\in dom(A)$ (one also writes $A\subset A^*$).

The domain of $A^*$ is the set of all vectors $y\in H$ such that the linear functional
$x\mapsto (Ax|y)$ is bounded on $dom(A)$. 

The graph $\Gamma_A\subset H\oplus H$ satisfies $\Gamma_{A^*} = \tau(\Gamma_A)^\perp$ where $\perp$ denotes the [[orthogonal complement]] and $\tau$ denotes the transposition of the direct summands changing the sign of one of the factors, i.e. $x\oplus y\mapsto -y\oplus x$. An unbounded operator $A$ is __closed__ if $\Gamma_A$ is closed subspace of $H\oplus H$. An operator $B$ is a closure of an operator $A$ if $\Gamma_B$ is a closure of operator $\Gamma_A$. It is said that $B$ is an __extension__ of $A$ and one writes $B\supset A$ if $\Gamma_B\supset \Gamma_A$. The closure of an unbounded operator does not need to exist.

For any unbounded operator $A$ with a dense $dom(A)\subset H$, if the adjoint operator $A^*$ exists, then $A^*$ is closed, and if $(A^*)^*$ exists then it coincides with a closure of $A$.

An [[unbounded operator]] $A : H\to H$ on a Hilbert space $H$ is __self-adjoint__ if

* it has a densely defined domain $dom(A)\subset H$
* $A = A^*$, i.e. $dom(A^*)= dom(A)$ and $A x = A^* x$ for all $x\in dom(A)$

An (unbounded) operator is __essentially self-adjoint__ if it is symmetric and its [[spectrum]] (as a subspace of the [[complex plane]]) is contained in the [[real line]]. Alternatively, it is symmetric if its closure is self-adjoint. 

A __Hermitean__ (or __hermitian__) operator is a [[bounded operator|bounded]] symmetric operator (which is necessarily self-adjoint), although some authors use the term for any self-adjoint operator.

For a bounded operator $A: H\to K$ between Hilbert spaces, define the [[Hermitean conjugate]] operator $A^*: K\to H$ by $(Ax|y)_H = (x|A^*y)_K$, for all $x\in K$, $y\in H$. Distinguish it from the concept of the [[transposed operator]] $A^T: K^*\to H^*$ between the [[dual vector space|dual spaces]].

In an arbitrary $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]], a __self-adjoint__ or __hermitian__ element is any element $A$ such that $A^* = A$.

# Analytic functions

## Idea

An _analytic function_ is a [[function]] that is locally given by a converging [[power series]].


## Definitions

Let $V$ and $W$ be [[complete space|complete Hausdorff]] [[topological vector spaces]], let $W$ be [[locally convex space|locally convex]], let $c$ be an [[element]] of $V$, and let $(a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots)$ be an [[infinite sequence]] of [[homogeneous operator]]s from $V$ to $W$ with each $a_k$ of degree $k$.

Given an element $c$ of $V$, consider the [[infinite series]]

$$ 
  \sum_k a_k(x - c)
$$

(a [[power series]]).  Let $U$ be the [[interior]] of the set of $x$ such that this series converges in $W$; we call $U$ the __domain of convergence__ of the power series.  This series defines a [[function]] from $U$ to $W$; we are really interested in the case where $U$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], in which case it is a [[balanced neighbourhood]] of $c$ in $V$ (which is Proposition 5.3 of [Bochnak--Siciak](#BS)).

Let $D$ be any [[subset]] of $V$ and $f$ any [[continuous function]] from $D$ to $W$.  This function $f$ is __analytic__ if, for every $c \in D$, there is a power series as above with inhabited domain of convergence $U$ such that
$$ f(x) = \sum_k a_k(x - c) $$
for every $x$ in both $D$ and $U$.  (That $f$ is continuous follows automatically in many cases, including of course the finite-dimensional case.)


## Generalisation

The vector spaces $V$ and $W$ may be generalised to [[analytic manifold]]s and (more generally) [[analytic space]]s.  However, these are [[manifolds]] and [[varieties]] modelled on vector spaces using analytic [[transition functions]], so the notion of analytic function between vector spaces is most fundamental.


## Complex-analytic functions of one variable

If $W$ is a vector space over the [[complex numbers]], then we have this very nice theorem, due essentially to [[Édouard Goursat]]:

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
A function from $D \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ to $W$ is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] if and only if it is analytic.
=--

(Differentiability here is in the usual sense, that the difference quotient converges in $W$.)  See [[holomorphic function]] and [[Goursat theorem]].

## Idea


A [[manifold]] is a [[topological space]] that is locally isomorphic to a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$.

A **manifold with [[boundary]]** is a topological space that is locally isomorphic either to an $\mathbb{R}^n$ or to a **half-space** $H^n = \{ \vec x \in \mathbb{R}^n | x^n \geq 0\}$.

A **manifold with corners** is a topological space that is locally isomorphic to an $H^n_i = \{ \vec x \in \mathbb{R}^n | x^{i+1}, \cdots, x^n \geq 0\}$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$.

## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]], and particularly [[homotopy type theory]], an **identification** is a word sometimes used for an inhabitant of an [[identity type]]. Alternatives to the term identification include **[[identity]]**, **[[path]]**, or **[[equality]]**, though those phrases are also used in different contexts. 

Thus an identification $p:a=b$ provides a "reason", a "witness", or a "proof" that $a$ and $b$ "are equal", or more precisely a *way in which to identify them*.  The distinguishing feature of homotopy type theory is that in general, there may be more than one way to identify two things, i.e. more than one identification between two given elements.

### In singular homology

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $A \hookrightarrow X$ a [[subspace]]. Write $C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain complex]] of [[singular homology]] on $X$ and $C_\bullet(A) \hookrightarrow C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain map]] induced by the subspace inclusion. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The [[cokernel]] of this inclusion, hence the [[quotient]] $C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A)$ of $C_\bullet(X)$ by the [[image]] of $C_\bullet(A)$ under the inclusion, is the **chain complex of $A$-relative singular chains**. 

* A [[boundary]] in this quotient is called an **$A$-relative singular boundary**, 

* a [[cycle]] is called an **$A$-relative singular cycle**.

* The [[chain homology]] of the quotient is the **$A$-relative singular homology of $X$**

  $$
    H_n(X , A)\coloneqq H_n(C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A))
    \,.
  $$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that a singular $(n+1)$-chain $c \in C_{n+1}(X)$ is an $A$-relative cycle if its [[boundary]] $\partial c \in C_{n}(X)$ is, while not necessarily 0, contained in the $n$-chains of $A$: $\partial c \in C_n(A) \hookrightarrow C_n(X)$. So it vanishes only "up to contributions coming from $A$".

 {#RelationToQuotientTopologicalSpaces}

+-- {: .num_defn #GoodPair}
###### Definition

A [[topological subspace]] inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ is called a **good pair** if 

1. $A$ is [[closed subset|closed]] inside $X$;

1. $A$ has an [[neighbourhood]] in $X$ which is a [[deformation retract]] of $A$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

For $X$ a [[CW complex]], the inclusion of any subcomplex $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a good pair (called a _[[CW-pair]]_ $(X,A)$).

=--

This is discussed at  _[CW complex -- Subcomplexes](CW+complex#Subcomplexes)_.




+-- {: .num_prop #HomologyOfQuotientSpace}
###### Proposition

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a [[topological subspace]] inclusion which is _good_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}, then the $A$-relative singular homology of $X$ coincides with the [[reduced singular homology]] of the [[quotient space]] $X/A$: 

$$
  H_n(X , A)
  \simeq
  \tilde H_n(X/A)
 \,.
$$

=--

For instance ([Hatcher, prop. 2.22](#Hatcher)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption we can find a [[neighbourhood]] $A \stackrel{j}{\to} U \hookrightarrow X$ such that $A \hookrightarrow U$ has a [[deformation retract]] and hence in particular is a [[homotopy equivalence]] and so induces also isomorphisms on all [[singular homology]] groups. 

It follows in particular that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the canonical morphism $H_n(X,A) \stackrel{H_n(id,j)}{\to} H_n(X,U)$ is an [[isomorphism]], by prop. \ref{HomotopyInvariance}.

Given such $U$ we have an evident [[commuting diagram]] of pairs of [[topological spaces]]

$$
  \array{
    (X,A) &\stackrel{(id,j)}{\to}& (X,U) &\leftarrow& (X-A, U - A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    (X/A, A/A) &\stackrel{(id,j/A)}{\to}& (X/A, U/A) &\leftarrow& (X/A - A/A, U/A - A/A)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the right vertical morphism is in fact a [[homeomorphism]].

Applying relative singular homology to this diagram yields for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[commuting diagram]] of abelian groups

$$
  \array{
    H_n(X,A) &\underoverset{\simeq}{H_n(id,j)}{\to}& H_n(X,U) &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& H_n(X-A, U - A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    H_n(X/A, A/A) &\underoverset{\simeq}{H_n(id,j/A)}{\to}& H_n(X/A, U/A) &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& H_n(X/A - A/A, U/A - A/A)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the left horizontal morphisms are the above isomorphims induced from the deformation retract. The right horizontal morphisms are isomorphisms by prop. \ref{ExcisionA} and the right vertical morphism is an isomorphism since it is induced by a homeomorphism. Hence the left vertical morphism is an isomorphism ([[2-out-of-3]] for isomorphisms).

###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[topological space]] and let $x \colon  * \hookrightarrow X$ any point. Then the relative singular homology $H_n(X , *)$ is isomorphic to the absolute [[reduced singular homology]] $\tilde H_n(X)$ of $X$

$$
  H_n(X , *) \simeq \tilde H_n(X)

This is the special case of prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace} for $A$ a point.

=--



## Examples

### Basic examples

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

The [[reduced singular homology]] of the $n$-[[sphere]] $S^{n}$  equals the $S^{n-1}$-relative homology of the $n$-[[disk]] with respect to the canonical [[boundary]] inclusion $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow D^n$: for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(S^n) \simeq H_\bullet(D^n, S^{n-1})
 \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The $n$-[[sphere]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the $n$-[[disk]] with its entire [[boundary]] identified with a point:

$$
  S^n \simeq D^n/S^{n-1}
  \,.
$$

Moreover the boundary inclusion is evidently a _good pair_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}. Therefore the example follows with prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace}.

### Detecting homology isomorphisms

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

If an inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ is such that all relative homology vanishes, $H_\bullet(X , A) \simeq 0$, then the inclusion induces isomorphisms on all singular homology groups.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Under the given assumotion the long exact sequence in prop. \ref{RelativeHomologyLongExactSequence} secomposes into short exact pieces of the form

$$
  0 \to H_n(A) \to H_n(X) \to 0
  \,.

### Relative homology of CW-complexes
 {#RelativeHomologyOfCWComplexes}


Let $X$ be a [[CW-complex]] and write 

$$

$$

for its [[filtered topological space]]-structure with $X_{n+1}$ the topological space obtained from $X_n$ by gluing on $(n+1)$-cells.


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The relative singular homology of the filtering degrees is

$$
  H_n(X_k , X_{k-1})
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z}[Cells(X)_n] & if\; k = n
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,,
$$

where $Cells(X)_n \in Set$ denotes the set of $n$-cells of $X$ and $\mathbb{Z}[Cells(X)_n]$ denotes the [[free abelian group]] on this set.


=--

For instance ([Hatcher, lemma 2.34](#Hatcher)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusion $X_{k-1} \hookrightarrow X_k$ is clearly a _good pair_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}. The quotient $X_k/X_{k-1}$ is by definition of CW-complexes a [[wedge sum]] of $k$-[[spheres]], one for each element in $kCell$. Therefore by prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace} we have an isomorphism $H_n(X_k , X_{k-1}) \simeq \tilde H_n( X_k / X_{k-1})$ with the [[reduced homology]] of this wedge sum. The statement then follows by the respect of reduced homology for wedge sums as discussed at _[Reduced homology - Respect for wedge sums](reduced+homology#RelationToWedgeSums)_.

## Idea

In general, the [[homology]] of a [[point]] is not trivial but is concentrated in degree 0 on the given [[coefficient]] object. For some applications, though, it is convenient to divide out that contribution such as to have the homology of the point be entirely trivial. This is called _reduced homology_.

## Definition

### Reduced singular homology

We discuss the reduced version of [[singular homology]].

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Write $C_\bullet(X)$ for its [[singular chain complex]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **augmentation map** is the homomorphism of abelian groups

$$
  \epsilon \colon C_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

which adds up all the coefficients of all 0-chains:

$$
  \epsilon \colon \colon \sum_{i} n_i \sigma_i \mapsto \sum_i n_i
  \,.
$$

Since the boundary of a 1-chain is in the [[kernel]] of this map, it constitutes a [[chain map]]

$$
  \epsilon \colon C_\bullet(X) \to \mathbb{Z}
  \,,
$$

where now $\mathbb{Z}$ is regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #ReducedSingularChainComplex}
###### Definition

The **reduced singular chain complex** $\tilde C_\bullet(X)$ of $X$ is the [[kernel]] of the augmentation map, the chain complex sitting in the [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to \tilde C_\bullet(X) \to C_\bullet(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} \mathbb{Z} \to 0
  \,.
$$

The **reduced singular homology** $\tilde H_\bullet(X)$ of $X$ is the [[chain homology]] of the reduced singular chain complex

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(X) \coloneqq H_\bullet(\tilde C_\bullet(X))
  \,.

###### Proposition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H_n(X)

      \tilde H_n(X) & for \; n \geq 1
      \\
      \tilde H_0(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z} & for\; n = 0
    }
  \right.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[homology long exact sequence]] of the defining short exact sequence $\tilde C_\bullet(C) \to C_\bullet(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} \mathbb{Z}$ is, since $\mathbb{Z}$ here is concentrated in degree 0, of the form

$$
  \cdots \to \tilde H_n(X) \to H_n(X) \to 0 \to \cdots \to 
  0 \to 
  \cdots \to \tilde H_1(X) \to H_1(X) \to 0 \to 
  \tilde H_0(X) \to H_0(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to}  \mathbb{Z} \to 0 
  \,.
$$

Here [[exact sequence|exactness]] says that all the morphisms $\tilde H_n(X) \to H_n(X)$ for positive $n$ are [[isomorphisms]]. Moreover, since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[free abelian group]], hence a [[projective object]], the remaining [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to \tilde H_0(X) \to H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

is [[split exact sequence|split]] (as discussed there) and hence $H_0(X) \simeq \tilde H_0(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$.
 
=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X = *$ the [[point]], the morphism

$$
  H_0(\epsilon) \colon H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

is an [[isomorphism]]. Accordingly the reduced homology of the point vanishes in every degree:

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(*) \simeq 0
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion at _[Singular homology -- Relation to homotopy groups](singular%20homology#RelationToHomotopyGroups)_ we have that 

$$
  H_n(*) \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z} & for \; n = 0
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Moreover, it is clear that $\epsilon \colon C_0(*) \to \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[identity]] map.

### Relation to relative homology
 {#RelationToRelativeHomology}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X$ an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[topological space]], its reduced singular homology, def. \ref{ReducedSingularChainComplex}, coincides with its [[relative singular homology]] relative to any base point $x \colon * \to X$:

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(X)
  \simeq
   H_\bullet(X,*)
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the sequence of [[topological subspace]] inclusions

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow * \stackrel{x}{\hookrightarrow} X
  \,.
$$

By the discussion at _[Relative homology - long exact sequences](relative%20homology#LongExactSequences)_ this induces a [[long exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  H_{n+1}(*) \to H_{n+1}(X) \to H_{n+1}(X,*)
  \to
  H_n(*) \to H_n(X) \to H_n(X,*)
  \to 
  \cdots
  \to 
  H_1(X) \to H_1(X,*) \to  H_0(*) \stackrel{H_0(x)}{\to}  H_0(X) \to H_n(X,*)
  \to 0
  \,.
$$

Here in positive degrees we have $H_n(*) \simeq 0$ and therefore [[exact sequence|exactness]] gives [[isomorphisms]]

$$
  H_n(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(X,*)\;\; \forall_{n \geq 1}
$$

and hence with prop. \ref{RelationBetweenReducedSingularAndSingular} isomorphisms

$$
  \tilde H_n(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(X,*)\;\; \forall_{n \geq 1}  
  \,.
$$

It remains to deal with the case in degree 0. To that end, observe that $H_0(x) \colon H_0(*) \to H_0(X)$ is a [[monomorphism]]: for this notice that we have a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     H_0(*) &\stackrel{id}{\to}& H_0(*)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{H_0(x)}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{H_0(f)}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{H_0(\epsilon)}}_\simeq
     \\
     H_0(X) &\stackrel{H_0(\epsilon)}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,,
$$

where $f \colon X \to *$ is the terminal map. 
That the outer square commutes means that $H_0(\epsilon) \circ H_0(x) = H_0(\epsilon)$ and hence the composite on the left is an [[isomorphism]]. This implies that $H_0(x)$ is an injection.

Therefore we have a [[short exact sequence]] as shown in the top of this diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& H_0(*) &\stackrel{H_0(x)}{\hookrightarrow}&
    H_0(X) &\stackrel{}{\to}& H_0(X,*)
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{H_0(\epsilon)}} & 
   \\
   && && \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,.
$$

Using this we finally compute

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde H_0(X)
    & \coloneqq 
    ker H_0(\epsilon)
    \\
    & \simeq coker( H_0(x) )
    \\
    & \simeq H_0(X,*)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

## Definition

A [[function]] $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is __injective__ if $x = y$ whenever $f(x) = f(y)$. Equivalently, a function is injective if all its [[fibers]] are [[subsingletons]]: for all elements $b \in B$ and for all elements $x \in A$ and $y \in A$, if $f(x) = b$ and $f(y) = b$, then $x = y$. An injective function is also called __one-to-one__ or an __injection__; it is the same as a [[monomorphism]] in [[Set|the category of sets]]. 

A _[[bijection]]_ is a function that is both injective and [[surjection|surjective]].

In [[constructive mathematics]], a [[strongly extensional function]] between sets equipped with tight [[apartness relation]]s is called __strongly injective__ if $f(x) \ne f(y)$ whenever $x \ne y$ (which implies that the function is injective).  This is the same as a [[regular monomorphism]] in the category of such sets and strongly extensional functions (while any merely injective function, if strongly extensional, is still a monomorphism).  Some authors use 'one-to-one' for an injective function as defined above and reserve 'injective' for the stronger notion.

## In other categories
Since an element $a$ in a set $A$ in the [[category of sets]] is just a [[global element]] $a:1\rightarrow A$, one could define injections in any category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is an __injection__ or a __one-to-one morphism__ if, given any two global elements $x, y:1\rightarrow A$, $x = y$ if $f \circ x = f \circ y$.

###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$, every global element $e:1\rightarrow A$ is an injection.

By definition of [[terminal object]] $1$, the unique global element $i:1\rightarrow 1$ is the identity morphism of the terminal object. Thus for every global element $e:1\rightarrow A$, for any two global elements $x, y:1\rightarrow 1$, $x = y$ is always true, making $e:1\rightarrow A$ an injection. 
=--

If the category has a [[strict initial object]] $\emptyset$, then every morphism $f:\emptyset\rightarrow B$ is vacuously an injection, since there are no global elements $x:1\rightarrow\emptyset$.

## Idea

A _relation_ is the extension of a _[[predicate]]_.  That is, if you have a statement whose [[truth value]] may depend on some [[variables]], then you get a relation that consists of those instantiations of the variables that make the statement [[true]].  Equivalently, you can think of a relation as a [[function]] whose [[target]] is the set of truth values.

  \array{
     && R
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
    A_1 && && A_1
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence relations are precisely the [[(-1)-truncated]] [[correspondences]].

This identification induces a natural notion of [[composition]] of relations from the composition in the [[category of correspondences]], see below at _[The 2-poset of binary relations](#The2PosetOfBinaryRelations)_.

Formulated this way, the notion of relation generalizes to [[categories]] other than [[Set]] and to [[higher category theory]]. For more on this see at _[Generalizations](#Generalization)_ below.

### Special cases

A __nullary relation__ is a relation on the empty family of sets.  This is the same as a [[truth value]].

A __unary relation on $A$__ is a relation on the singleton family $(A)$.  This is the same as a [[subset]] of $A$.

A __binary relation on $A$ and $B$__ is a relation on the family $(A,B)$, that is a subset of $A \times B$.  This is also called a __relation from $A$ to $B$__, especially in the context of the $2$-category [[Rel]] described below, or sometimes called a __heterogenous relation__.

A __binary relation on $A$__ is a relation on $(A,A)$, that is a relation from $A$ to itself.  This is sometimes called a __homogenous relation__ on $A$, simply a __relation on $A$__, or just an __endorelation__ with its set implicit as a property if not explicitly mentioned.

An __$n$-ary relation__ on $A$ is a relation on a family of $n$ copies of $A$, that is a subset of $A^n$.

For a binary relation, one often uses a symbol such as $\sim$ and writes $a \sim b$ instead of $(a,b) \in \sim$.  Actually, even when a relation is given by a letter such as $R$, one often sees $a R b$ instead of $(a,b) \in R$, although now that does not look so good.

### Internal and external relations

In foundations of mathematics with a [[sort]] of [[propositions]] and a separate sort of [[sets]], such as most presentations of [[set theory]] in [[first-order logic]] with [[equality]], there are actually two notions of relation. The definition given above is the notion of **internal relation**, defined as a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] of a [[family of sets]]. There is a second definition of relation on a set: external relations, which are not defined purely inside of the set theory. Since each set has a type of elements inside of the set, an **external relation** is simply a [[proposition]] in the [[context]] of a family of [[variables]] $x_i$ inside of a family of sets $A_i$
$$\Gamma, x_0 \in A_0, x_1 \in A_1, x_2 \in A_2, \ldots, x_n \in A_n \vdash P \; \mathrm{prop}$$
In any [[unsorted set theory]], those variables would be expressed as
$$\Gamma, x_0, A_0, x_0 \in A_0 \; \mathrm{true}, x_1, A_1, x_1 \in A_1 \; \mathrm{true}, x_2, A_2, x_2 \in A_2 \; \mathrm{true}, \ldots, x_n, A_n, x_n \in A_n \; \mathrm{true} \vdash P \; \mathrm{prop}$$
It is in this second sense of external relation that [[equality]] in [[first-order logic with equality]] is an [[equivalence relation]], and [[inequality]] is a [[tight apartness relation]] in a first-order theory with equality presented in [[classical logic]]. 

In [[dependent type theory]], where propositions are considered to be the [[subsingletons]] or the [[sets]]/[[types]] themselves, there is only one notion of relation, the internal notion given above. 

## Morphisms

If $A$ and $B$ are each sets equipped with a relation, then what makes a [[function]] $f: A \to B$ a _morphism_ of sets so equipped?

There are really two ways to do this, shown below.  (We will write these as if each set is equipped with a binary relation $\sim$, but any fixed arity would work.)

*  $f$ __preserves__ the relation if $x \sim y \;\Rightarrow\; f(x) \sim f(y)$ always;
*  *f* __reflects__ the relation if $x \sim y \;\Leftarrow\; f(x) \sim f(y)$ always.

Now, if $f$ is a [[bijection]], then it preserves the relation if and only if its inverse reflects it, so clearly an [[isomorphism]] of relation-equipped sets should do both.  What about a mere morphism?

In general, it\'s more natural to require only preservation; these are the morphisms you get if you consider a set with a relation as a models of a [[algebraic theory|finite-limit theory]] or a simply [[directed graph]].

But in some contexts, particularly when dealing only with [[irreflexive relation]]s, we instead require (only) that a morphism reflect the relation.  Sometimes an even stricter condition is imposed, as for [[well-order]]s.  But even in these cases, the definition of isomorphism comes out the same.


## Binary relations

Binary relations are especially widely used.


### Kinds of binary relations

Special kinds of relations from $A$ to $B$ include:

* [[functional relations]],
* [[entire relations]],
* [[one-to-one relation]]s,
* [[onto relation]]s.

Combinations of the above properties of binary relations produce:

* [[functions]],
* [[partial functions]],
* [[injections]],
* [[surjections]],
* [[bijections]].

Special kinds of binary relations on $A$ (so from $A$ to itself) additionally include:

* [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]] relations;
* [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]] relations;
* [[transitive relations]] and [[comparisons]];
* left and right [[euclidean relations]];
* [[total relation|total]] and [[connected relation|connected]] relations;
* [[extensional relation|extensional]] and [[well-founded relation|well-founded]] relations.

Combinations of the above properties of binary relations produce:

* [[equivalence relations]],
* [[partial equivalence relations]],
* [[apartness relations]],
* the various kinds of [[orders]] (which see).

### Structure preserving relations

Given [[pointed sets]] $(A, a)$ and $(B, b)$, a binary relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is said to preserve the point if $R(a, b)$. 

Given sets with endofunctions $(A, f_A)$ and $(B, f_B)$, a binary relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is said to preserve the endofunction if for every $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, if $R(a, b)$, then $R(f(a), f(b))$. 

Given [[magmas]] $(A, \mu_A)$ and $(B, \mu_b)$, a binary relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is said to preserve the binary operation if for every $a \in A$, $c \in A$, $b \in B$ and $d \in B$, if $R(a, b)$ and $R(c, d)$, then $R(\mu_A(a, b), \mu_B(b, d))$. 

And so forth. 

### Properties

Every binary endorelation $R$ has an [[equivalence relation]] $\sim_R$ generated by $R$. 

### Binary relations as a coalgebra

By [[currying]] the binary relation $R: \mathcal{P}(X \times X) \cong X \times X \rightarrow \Omega$, one gets a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor|coalgebra]] $\theta: X \rightarrow (X \rightarrow \Omega) \cong X \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)$ for the [[powerset]] [[endofunctor]] on [[Set]].  

### The $2$-poset of binary relations
 {#The2PosetOfBinaryRelations}

Binary relations form a $2$-[[2-category|category]] (in fact a $2$-[[2-poset|poset]]) [[Rel]], which is the basic example of an [[allegory]].

The [[objects]] are [[sets]], the [[morphisms]] from $A$ to $B$ are the binary relations on $A$ and $B$, and there is a [[2-morphism]] from $R$ to $S$ (both from $A$ to $B$) if $R$ implies $S$ (that is, when $(a,b) \in R$, then $(a,b) \in S$).

The interesting definition is [[composition]] 

+-- {: .num_defn #CompositionOfRelations}
###### Defintion

If $R$ is a relation from $A$ to $B$ and $S$ is a relation from $B$ to $C$, then their _composite relation_  -- written $S \circ R$ or $R;S$ -- from $A$ to $C$ is defined as follows:
$$(a,c) \in R;S \;\Leftrightarrow\; \exists b: B,\; (a,b) \in R \;\wedge\; (b,c) \in S.$$

The identity morphism is given by [[equality]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[composition]] operation of relation from def. \ref{CompositionOfRelations} is induced by the composition of the underlying [[correspondences]], followed by [[(-1)-truncated|(-1)-truncation]].

=--

The special properties of the kinds of binary relations listed earlier can all be described in terms internal to [[Rel]]; most of them make sense in any [[allegory]].  Irreflexive and asymmetric relations are most useful if the allegory\'s [[hom-object|hom-poset]]s have [[bottom]] elements, and linear relations require this.  Comparisons require the hom-posets to have finite [[union|unions]], and well-founded relations require some sort of higher-order structure.

As a [[function]] may be seen as a functional, entire relation, so the category [[Set]] of sets and functions is a [[subcategory]] of [[Rel]] (in fact a [[replete subcategory|replete]] and locally [[full subcategory|full]] sub-$2$-category).

### The quasitopos of endorelations {#endorel}

Endorelations on sets are the objects of the [[quasitopos]] __$EndoRel$__ or __$Bin$__. It is a  [[reflective subcategory]] of [[Quiv]] the [[category of presheaves|presheaf topos]] of quivers and its morphisms are quiver morphisms. Endorelations are the [[separated presheaf|separated presheaves]] for the [[double negation#in_topos_theory|double negation topology]] on $Quiv$. "Separated" here translates to a quiver having  at most one arc between pairs of verticies. The [[reflective subcategory|reflector]] $Quiv \to EndoRel$ collapses parallel arcs together. Such quivers might also be called __singular__ or __simple__  though sometimes "simple" also means "no loops".

#### Relation closures as reflexive subcategories of $EndoRel$

All of the sub-types  of endorelations with positive conditions ([[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], [[transitive relations|transitive]], and left and right [[euclidean relations|euclidean]]) and their combinations have an associated [[Moore closure|closure]] that can produce one from an arbitrary relation. Such a closure [[completion|completes]] a relation by adding the least number of arcs such that the conditions are satisfied.
Within $EndoRel$ these closures are reflectors that produce reflective subcategories.
For example the __symmetric closure__ $sym: EndoRel \to EndoSym$ will (possibly) enlarge  a quiver that contains any arc $v_a \to v_b$ to one that also contains  $v_b \to v_a$. The __transitive and reflexive closure__ $transRef: EndoRel \to EndoTransRef$ produces a category which is isomorphic to [[preorder|PreOrd]] though its objects are the underlying quivers of the preorders which are the objects of $PreOrd$.

In addition to being reflective, the categories from the _symmetric_, _reflexive_, and _symmetric and reflexive_  closures are also quasitoposes that can be [[quasitopos#exampsep|directly defined]] through  double negation separation. The _symmetric and reflexive_ closure ([[category of simple graphs|SimpGph]]) is also a [[quasitopos|Grothendieck quasitopos]]. On the other hand $PreOrd$ is not a quasitopos because it is not a [[regular category]].

## Ternary relations 

Apart from binary relations, there are important ternary relations used in mathematics, which for the most part are [[families]] of binary relations indexed by a third set:

* [[uniformity]], where the index set is the set of [[entourages]]. 
* [[premetric]], where the index set is the set of [[real numbers]], or in some cases, the set of [[rational numbers]]. 

## Generalisation
 {#Generalization}

Most of the preceding makes sense in any [[category]] with enough [[products]]; giving rise to [[internal relation|internal relations]], for instance _[[congruences]]_ in the case of internal equivalence relations. 

Probably the trickiest bit is the definition of [[composition]] of binary relations, so not every category with [[finite products]] has an [[allegory]] of relations.  In fact, in a certain precise sense, a category has an allegory of relations if and only if it is [[regular category|regular]].  It can then be recovered from this allegory by looking at the functional entire relations.

## Definition

A **(left/right/2-sided) principal ideal** in a [[ring]] $R$ is a left/right/2-sided [[ideal]] $I$ generated by an element $x \in R$, or equivalently a [[left module|left sub-$R$-module]]/[[right module|right sub-$R$-module]]/[[bimodule|sub-$R$-$R$-bimodule]] [[generators and relations|generated by]] $x$. 

This means there exists an element $x \in I$ such that $y$ is a multiple of $x$ whenever $y \in I$; we say that $I$ is __generated__ by $x$. Thus every element $x$ generates a unique principal ideal, the set of all left/right/two-sided multiples of $x$: $a x$, $x b$, or $a x b$ if we are talking about left/right/two-sided ideals in a ring. Clearly, every ideal $I$ is a join over all the principal ideals $P_x$ generated by the elements $x$ of $I$.

### In commutative rings

In commutative rings, since the set of all principal ideals is isomorphic to the quotient of (the multiplicative monoid structure on) $R$ by the group of units, a **principal ideal** $I$ is equivalently an element of the quotient monoid $I \in R/R^\times$.

The __exterior__ of a [[subset]] of a [[topological space]] is the [[interior]] of its [[complement]], or equivalently the complement of its [[topological closure|closure]].  In more elementary terms, $x \in Ext A$ iff there is some [[neighbourhood]] of $x$ that is [[disjoint subsets|disjoint]] from $A$. 

The exterior operation applied to [[open sets]], i.e., to a [[topology]] $\mathcal{O}$ of a space, coincides with the [[negation]] operation $\neg: \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{O}$ when we view $\mathcal{O}$ as a [[frame]] or [[Heyting algebra]]. See also [[regular open set]].

# Functionals
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Disambiguation

This is about functionals in the sense of [[higher-order logic]], which is the original sense and which has only that name.  For functionals in the sense of [[functional analysis]], see _[[linear functional]]_; for the relation between these, see under Examples below.  For functionals on [[infinite-dimensional manifolds]], see at _[[nonlinear functional]]_.


## Definition

In a [[type theory]] with [[function types]], given a [[type]] $X$, a __functional__ of base type $X$ is a [[term]] of type $X^{X^X}$ aka $(X \to X) \to X$.  This should be distinguished from (on the one hand) an [[operator]], which is a term of type $(X^X)^{X^X}$ aka $(X \to X) \to (X \to X)$, and (on the other hand) a [[endofunction|function]], which (in this context) is a term of type $X^X$ aka $X \to X$.

More generally, any term whose type has the form $A^{B^C}$ aka $(C \to B) \to A$ may be called a functional, although usually not if any of these types is very trivial (since any type has this form, up to equivalence, if $B,C \coloneqq 1$).

Although one typically interprets type theory within [[set theory]] so that operations between types become [[functions]], one may also use [[partial functions]], which is necessary for many of the examples below.

A functional could also be interpreted within [[category theory]] as a [[simplex|simplicial]] [[2-morphism]] in the [[2-category|2-]][[category of sets]]. 

## Examples

In [[variational calculus]] one studies functions on spaces of [[sections]] of [[jet bundles]] or other [[mapping spaces]].  The notion of [[nonlinear functional]] is an abstraction of this.  For example, such functionals appear in [[physics]] as [[action functionals]].  See [[covariant phase space]] and [[path integral]] for other functionals in physics.

If we interpret $X$ as the [[real line]], then $X^X$ consists of real-valued maps of a real variable, which form a [[vector space]].  The [[linear maps]] from $X^X$ to $X$ are the original [[linear functionals]].  In [[functional analysis]], we now replace $X^X$ with an arbitrary [[topological vector space]] $V$ (originally but no longer necessarily taken to be a [[vector subspace|subspace]] of $X^X$) and consider linear maps from $V$ to $X$ instead; so these linear functionals are actually unstructured operations in a type-theoretic sense.

## Definition

Given a [[subset]] $S$ of (the [[underlying]] [[set]] of) a [[group]] $G$, its __normalizer__ $N(S) = N_G(S)$ is the [[subgroup]] of $G$ consisting of all elements $g\in G$ such that $g S = S g$, i.e. for each $s\in S$ there is $s'\in S$ such that $g s = s'g$.  

Notice the similarity but also the difference to the definition of the _[[centralizer subgroup]]_, for which $s' = s$ in the above.

## Properties

### Normalization and Weyl group
 {#NormalizationAndWeylGroup}

If the subset $S$ is in fact a [[subgroup]] of $G$, then it is a [[normal subgroup]] of the normalizer $N_G(S)$; and $N_G(S)$ is the largest subgroup of $G$ such that $S$ is a normal subgroup of it, whence the terminology _normalizer_. 

Indeed, if $S$ is already a normal subgroup of $G$, then its normalizer coincides with the whole of $G$, and only then (e.g. [here](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Normal_Subgroup_iff_Normalizer_is_Group)).

Hence when $S$ is a group then the [[quotient]] 

$$
  W_G S \coloneqq N_G(S)/S
$$ 

is a [[quotient group]]. This is also called the _[[Weyl group]]_ of $S$ in $G$. (This use of terminology is common in [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] -- see e.g. [May 96, p. 13](#May96) -- but not otherwise.)

## Examples

### Holomorph

Each group $G$ embeds into the [[symmetric group]] $Sym(G)$ on the [[underlying set]] of $G$ by the left [[regular representation]] $g\mapsto l_g$ where $l_g(h) = g h$. The [[image]] is isomorphic to $G$ (that is, the left regular representation of a [[discrete group]] is [[faithful representation|faithful]]). 

The normalizer of the image of $G$ in $Sym(G)$ is called the [[holomorph]]. This solves the elementary problem of embedding a group into a bigger group $K$ in which every [[automorphism]] of $G$ is obtained by restricting (to $G$) an [[inner automorphism]] of $K$ that fixes $G$ as a subset of $K$.

## Generalization

In ([Gray 14](#Gray14)) the concept of the normalizer of a subgroup of a group is generalized to the normalizer of a [[monomorphism]] in any [[pointed category]] in terms of a universal decomposition $U \stackrel{u}{\to} N \stackrel{f}{\to}T$ of a [[monomorphism]] $U \to T$ with $u$ a [[normal monomorphism]].

In ([Bourn-Gray 13](#BournGray13)) the condition that $w$ be a monomorphism is dropped.

###### Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is said to be __locally contractible__ if it has a [[basis for a topology|basis]] of [[open subset]]s that consists of [[contractible]] topological spaces $U \hookrightarrow X$.
=--

Sometimes one requires just that the inclusions $U \to X$ are [[null-homotopic map]]s. This might be called **semi-locally contractible**.

One could also consider a basis of open sets such that the opens $U$ have (just) trivial [[homotopy group]]s, but this does not seem to crop up in practice.

###### Definition

A [[locale]] $X$ is __locally contractible__ if, viewing a locale as a $(0,1)$-[[(0,1)-topos|topos]] and hence a (very special kind of) $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-topos|topos]], it is [[locally infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos|locally ∞-connected]].

## Examples 

* Any [[CW-complex]] is locally contractible (see [there](CW+complex#CWComplexesAreLocallyContractible)).

* Any [[paracompact space|paracompact]] [[manifold]] is locally contractible.

* Any [[contractible space]] is semi-locally contractible

* The [[cone]] on the [[Hawaiian earring space]] is contractible, hence semi-locally contractible, but is not locally contractible, as any neighbourhood of the 'bad point' is not simply connected.

###### Proposition

For $X$ a locally contractible topological space, the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ is a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]].

This is discussed at [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-site]].


## Other viewpoints

If one considers [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]]s, the inclusion $U \to X$ being null-homotopic is equivalent to the induced [[(∞,1)-functor]] $\Pi(U) \to \Pi(X)$ being naturally isomorphic to the trivial functor sending everything to a single point.

# Separable spaces
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definitions

A [[topological space]] is __separable__ if it has a [[countable set|countable]] [[dense subspace|dense]] subset.

To be explicit, $X$ is __separable__ if there exists an [[infinite sequence]] $a\colon \mathbb{N} \to X$ such that, given any point $b$ in $X$ and any [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $b$, we have $a_i \in U$ for some $i$.


## Properties

A [[second-countable space]] is separable (and trivially it is 
[[first-countable space|first-countable]]). However, first-countability plus separability do not imply second-countability; a counterexample is $\mathbb{R}$ with the half-open topology (see [Munkres](#Munk), page 192), denoted $\mathbb{R}_l$. 

An arbitrary [[product]] of separable spaces need not be separable, but a product of as many as a continuum number of separable spaces _is_ separable (with the product computed in [[Top]]); a proof of the more general Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery theorem can be found [here](#Brandsma). In particular, the space $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}$ of _all_ [[functions]] $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ under pointwise convergence is separable, but is not even first-countable (and thus not second-countable either). A first-countable space need not be separable; a simple example of that is a [[discrete space]] of uncountable cardinality. 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
Although an arbitrary product of separable spaces need not be separable, an arbitrary product of separable spaces does satisfy the [[countable chain condition]] (see there for more discussion). This is somewhat remarkable, since it is not necessarily true that even a finite product of spaces satisfying the countable chain condition also satisfies the countable chain condition (whether it does is independent of [[ZFC]]). 
=-- 

Subspaces of separable spaces need not be separable. Example: the product $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$, also called the [[Sorgenfrey plane]], is separable, but the subspace defined by the equation $y = -x$ is uncountable and discrete and therefore not separable. However, open subspaces of separable spaces are separable. 

Many results in [[analysis]] are easiest for separable spaces.  This is particularly true if one wishes to avoid using strong forms of the [[axiom of choice]], or to use arguments [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] over the natural numbers. For example, the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]] for _separable_ [[Banach spaces]] can be established using only mild forms of choice, e.g., [[dependent choice]]. More precisely, it can be established in the weak subsystem $WKL_0$ of [[second-order arithmetic]]; see [Brown-Simpson](#BS). 

## Separable metric spaces 

A classical fact is 

+-- {: .num_theorem #classical} 
###### Theorem 
Using [[countable choice]], then:

For a metric space $X$ the following are equivalent

1. $X$ is separable;
1. $X$ is [[second-countable space|second-countable]];
1. $X$ is [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]], i.e. any open cover admits a countable subcover.
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The second property is implied by the first: given any dense subset $\{x_n \mid n\in \mathbb{N}\}$, form the countable system of sets $\{B_{1/m}(x_n) \mid n,m\in\mathbb{N}\}$. To see that this is indeed a [[base]] for the topology of $X$, take any open set $U\subset X$, a point $x\in U$ and a radius $1/k$ such that $B_{1/k}(x)\subset U$. By separability there is some $n$ such that $x_n\in B_{1/(2k)}(x)$ and therefore $x\in B_{1/(2k)}(x_i)\subset U$.

To show (2) implies (3), let $\{U_n\}$ be a countable base of the topology.
Given any open cover $\{V_\lambda\}$ of $X$, we can form the index set $I\subset \mathbb{N}$ of those $n$ that are contained in some $V_\lambda$.
By assumption $\bigcup_{i\in I} U_{i} = \bigcup_\lambda V_\lambda = X$.
The axiom of [[countable choice]] provides now a section of $\bigsqcup_{i\in I} \{\lambda \mid U_i \subset V_\lambda\}\to I$.

Finally, we prove that (3) implies (1).
Consider the open covers $\{B_{1/1}(x) \mid x\in X\}$, $\{B_{1/2}(x) \mid x\in X\}$, ...
From each extract a countable subcover corresponding to collection of centers $A_1, A_2, \ldots$. We claim that that the union $A_1\cup A_2\cup\ldots$ forms a dense set.
Indeed, given any $y\in X$ and $n$ the point $x$ has to be contained in some $B_{1/n}(x)$ for some $x\in A_n$.
=-- 

\begin{remark}
In the proof any variant of the [[axiom of choice]] is only used for the implication $(2)\Rightarrow(3)$. On the other hand, assuming [[countable choice]], this implication [[second-countable spaces are Lindelöf|holds in every topological space]].
The implication $(2)\Rightarrow(1)$ holds in any topological space as well (see Example \ref{2ndCountablImplSeparable})
\end{remark}

Similar in spirit to (1)$\Leftrightarrow$(2) but less well-known is the following. 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
A [[metric space]] $X$ is separable iff every open set is a countable union of balls. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
One direction is not hard: if $x_i$ is a countable dense subset of $X$ and $r_j$ is an enumeration of the rationals, then according to the proof of Theorem \ref{classical}, the balls $B_{r_j}(x_i)$ form a countable base ($X$ is a [[second-countable space]]). Hence every open set is a union of a family of such balls that is at most countable. 

The other direction is trickier. (This is based on a [MathOverflow discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/181226/if-any-open-set-is-a-countable-union-of-balls-does-it-imply-separability), which for the moment we record with little adaptation.) Suppose $X$ is not separable; construct by recursion a sequence $x_\beta$ of length $\omega_1$ such that no $x_\beta$ lies in the closure of the set of its predecessors $x_\alpha$ (each such set is countable and therefore not dense, so such $x_\beta$ outside its closure can be found at each stage). 

Therefore, for each $x_\beta$ we may choose a rational radius $r_\beta$ such that the ball $B_{r_\beta}(x_\beta)$ contains no predecessor $x_\alpha$. There are uncountably many $\beta$, so some rational radius $r$ was used uncountably many times. The collection of $x_\beta$ for which $r_\beta = r$ forms another $\omega_1$-sequence which we now use instead of the first; since all the radii are the same, this sequence has the property that each $B_r(x_\beta)$ contains no other $x_\alpha$, no matter whether $\alpha$ appears before or after $\beta$ in the sequence. 

Provided that there uncountably many such $x_\alpha$ that are non-isolated in $X$, we can construct an open set $U$ that is not a countable union of balls. For around each such $x_\alpha$ we can find a point $p_\alpha \neq x_\alpha$ within distance $r/4$ of $x_\alpha$; put $U = \bigcup_\alpha B_{d(x_\alpha, p_\alpha)}(x_\alpha)$. Notice that $p_\alpha \notin U$. If $B_s(x)$ is any ball contained in $U$, then $d(x, x_\gamma) \lt r/4$ for some $\gamma$. Supposing we have distinct $x_\alpha, x_\beta \in B_s(x)$, then $r \lt d(x_\alpha, x_\beta) \leq d(x_\alpha, x) + d(x, x_\beta) \lt s + s$, so $r/2 \lt s$. But then from $d(x_\gamma, p_\gamma) \lt r/4$ and $d(x, x_\gamma) \lt r/4$, we have $d(x, p_\gamma) \lt r/2 \lt s$ so that $p_\gamma \in B_s(x) \subset U$, a contradiction. We conclude that any ball contained in $U$ contains at most one $x_\alpha$, and so $U$ cannot be covered by countably many balls. 

We are therefore left to deal with the case where there are at most countably many non-isolated $x_\beta$. Discard these, so without loss of generality we may suppose all the $x_\beta$ are isolated points of $X$ and that for some fixed $r$ the ball $B_r(x_\beta)$ contains no other $x_\alpha$. Let $Z$ be this set of $x_\beta$. For each $\beta$, let $t_\beta$ be the supremum over all $t$ such that $B_t(x_\beta) \cap Z$ is countable. It follows that $B_{t_\beta}(x_\beta) \cap Z$ is itself countable, as is $\{\alpha: \alpha \lt \beta\}$. At each stage $\beta$, there is a countable set $C_\beta \subset Z$ disjoint from $B_{t_\beta}(x_\beta) \cup \{x_\alpha: \alpha \lt \beta\}$ such that for each $s \gt t_\beta$, there exists $y \in C_\beta$ with $d(x_\beta, y) \lt s$. By transfinite induction, we can construct a cofinal subset $I$ of $\omega_1$ such that $x_\beta \notin C_\alpha$ whenever $\alpha, \beta \in I$ and $\alpha \lt \beta$. The set $Y = \{x_\alpha: \alpha \in I\}$ is open in $X$, and we claim that it is not a countable union of balls. For suppose otherwise. Let $F$ be such a countable family of balls; then there is some minimal $\alpha$ for which $B_t(x_\alpha) \in F$ is uncountable, so that $t \gt t_\alpha$. By construction of $C_\alpha$, there exists $z \in C_\alpha \cap B_t(x_\alpha)$. But since $Y = \bigcup F$, we have that $z = x_\beta$ for some $\beta \in I$, and this contradicts our condition on $I$.

Every [[second-countable topological space]] is separable.
To see this take a countable cover and select a point in each member of the cover (using [[countable choice]]).

## Definition

\begin{definition}\label{InverseMorphism}
**([[inverse morphisms]])** \linebreak
An **inverse** of a [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ in a [[category]] or [[unital magmoid]] (or an element of a [[monoid]] or [[unital magma]]) is another morphism $f^{-1} \colon Y \to X$ which is both a [[left-inverse]] (a [[retraction]]) as well as a [[right-inverse]] (a [[section]]) of $f$, in that 
$$
  f \circ f^{-1} \,=\, id_Y \colon Y \to Y 
$$
[[equality|equals]] the [[identity morphism]] on $Y$ 
and
$$
  f^{-1} \circ f \,=\, id_X \colon X \to X 
$$
[[equality|equals]] the [[identity morphism]] on $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{Isomorphism}
A [[morphism]] that has an [[inverse morphism]] (Def. \ref{InverseMorphism}) is called an *[[isomorphism]]*.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
A ([[small category|small]]) [[category]] in which all morphisms have inverses is called a *[[groupoid]]*.
\end{remark}

## Properties


\begin{prop}\label{InversesAreUnique}
**([[inverse morphisms]] are unique)** \linebreak
  If $f$ is an [[isomorphism]] (Def. \ref{Isomorphism}) with [[inverse morphism]] $f^{-1}$ (Def. \ref{InverseMorphism}), then any [[left inverse]] as well as any [[right inverse]] is already an actual [[inverse morphism]] and in fact is [[equality|equal]] to $f^{-1}$.
\end{prop}
In particular, [[inverse morphisms]] are unique when they exist.
\begin{proof}
  Let $g$ be a [[left inverse]], hence such that $g \circ f \,=\, id$. 
  Write $f^{-1}$ for the actual inverse, hence such that
  $f^{-1} \circ f \,=\, id$ and $f \circ f^{-1} \,=\, id$.  
  Then the following sequence of equalities implies that
  $g = f^{-1}$:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
    g 
    & \;=\;
    g \circ id
    \\
    & \;=\;
    g \circ ( f \circ f^{-1} )
    \\
    & \;=\;
    (g \circ f) \circ f^{-1}
    \\
    & \;=\;
    id \circ f^{-1}
    \\
    & \;=\;
    f^{-1}
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
  $$
Here all steps use just the definitions of the various morphisms, except the third step, which uses [[associativity]] of [[composition]] in any [[category]].

An analogous argument applies to right inverses; and either argument applies to actual inverses.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
  Let $f$ be an [[isomorphism]] (Def. \ref{Isomorphism}).
  Then the inverse morphism $\left(f^{-1}\right)^{-1}$ of an inverse morphism $f^{-1}$ (Def. \ref{InverseMorphism}) exists and is [[equality|equal]] to the original morphism:
$$
  \left(f^{-1}\right)^{-1}
  \;=\;
  f
  \,.
$$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  By the uniqueness of inverses (Prop. \ref{InversesAreUnique}) for $f^{-1}$.
\end{proof}


## Examples

\begin{example}\label{IdentityMorphismsAreTheirOwnInverses}
**([[identity morphisms]] are their own [[inverse morphisms]])** \linebreak
Any [[identity morphism]]  is its own inverse morphism (Def. \ref{InverseMorphism}):
$$
  id^{-1} \,=\, id
  \,.
$$
\end{example}


\begin{example}
In a [[balanced category]], such as in a [[topos]] (in particular in [[Sets]]) every morphism that is both a [[monomorphism]] and well as an [[epimorphism]] is actually an [[isomorphism]] and thus has an [[inverse morphism]]. 

To see that this is not generally the case, notice that any [[partial order]] is an (necessarily unbalanced) category where every morphism is both a monomorphism as well as an epimorphism, but only its [[identity morphisms]] have [[inverse morphisms]] (as they must, by Exp.  \ref{IdentityMorphismsAreTheirOwnInverses}). 
\end{example}


## In non-unital contexts

In a [[magmoid]] or [[semicategory]] (or an element of a [[semigroup]] or [[magma]]), a morphism $f:a \to b$ has a unique __[[retraction]]__ $f^{-1}:b \to a$ if 

* for every morphism $g:b \to c$, $g \circ (f^{-1} \circ f) = g$,

* for every morphism $g:c \to a$, $(f^{-1} \circ f) \circ g = g$,

and a morphism $f:a \to b$ has a unique __[[section]]__ $f^{-1}:b \to a$ if 

* for every morphism $g:a \to c$, $g \circ (f \circ f^{-1}) = g$,

* for every morphism $g:a \to c$, $(f \circ f^{-1})\circ g = g$,

A morphism $f:a \to b$ has a unique __inverse__ if it has a retraction that is also a section.

## Definitions

Ideals show up both in [[ring]] theory and in [[lattice]] theory.  We recall both of these below and look at some slight generalizations.


### In rings (and other rigs)

A __left ideal__ in a [[ring]] (or even [[rig]]) $R$ is a [[subset]] $I$ of (the underlying set of) $R$ such that:

*  $0 \in I$;
*  $x + y \in I$ whenever $x, y \in I$;
*  $x y \in I$ whenever $y \in I$, regardless of whether $x \in I$.

A __right ideal__ in $R$ is a subset $I$ such that:

*  $0 \in I$;
*  $x + y \in I$ whenever $x, y \in I$;
*  $x y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$.

A __two-sided ideal__ in $R$ is a subset $I$ that is both a left and right ideal; that is:

*  $0 \in I$;
*  $x + y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$ and $y \in I$;
*  $x y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$ or $y \in I$.

This generalises to:

*  $x_1 + \cdots + x_n \in I$ whenever $x_k \in I$ for every $k$;
*  $x_1 \cdots x_n \in I$ whenever $x_k \in I$ for some $k$.

Notice that all three kinds of ideal are equivalent for a commutative ring.

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remarks 
* A left ideal in a ring $R$ may be equivalently defined as an $R$-submodule of $R$, viewing the latter as a left $R$-[[module]]. 
* A right ideal in a ring $R$ may be equivalently defined as an $R$-submodule of $R$, viewing the latter as a right $R$-[[module]]. 
* A two-sided ideal in a ring $R$ may be equivalently defined as a sub-bimodule of $R$, viewing the latter as an $R$-[[bimodule]]. 
* The collection of all two-sided ideals in a ring $R$ form a [[concrete category]], see [[category of two-sided ideals in a ring]]
* The preceding remarks apply to rigs as well. 
* Considering the category of rings as a Barr-exact category, there is a natural bijection between [[congruence|congruence relations]] on a ring $R$ (internal to the category of rings) and two-sided ideals of $R$; this associates to each ideal $I$ the relation $\sim_I$ where $x \sim_I y$ means $x - y \in I$. This observation does not apply to the category of rigs. 
=-- 

This definition also makes sense for [[nonassociative rings]] (or rigs), with the left/right/two-sided coincidence in the commutative case.

In the case of a [[nonunital ring]] (or rig), if $R$ is being thought of as a [[module]] over some other ring $K$, then it won\'t immediately follow that $I$ is a [[submodule]] of $R$ over $K$, and so one usually includes that requirement as well:

*  $a x \in I$ whenever $a \in K$ and $x \in I$

in the case of left-modules, and similarly in the case of right modules or [[bimodules]].  (Technically, this should be distinguished in the terminology, say by calling $I$ an __ideal of $R$ over $K$__ or the like.)  In particular, a (real or complex) [[Lie ideal]] of a [[Lie algebra]] $R$ is an ideal of $R$ over the real or complex field $K$.


### In lattices (and other prosets)

An __ideal__ in a [[lattice]] (or even [[preorder|proset]]) $L$ is a [[subset]] $I$ of (the underlying set of) $L$ such that:

*  There is an element of $I$ (so that $I$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]]);
*  if $x, y \in I$, then $x, y \leq z$ for some $z \in I$;
*  if $x \in I$ and $y \leq x$, then $y \in I$ too.

We can make this look more algebraic if $L$ is a (bounded) join-[[semilattice]]:

*  $\bot \in I$;
*  $x \vee y \in I$ if $x, y \in I$;
*  $y \in I$ whenever $x \vee y \in I$.

If $L$ is indeed a lattice, then we can make this look just like the ring version:

*  $\bot \in I$;
*  $x \vee y \in I$ whenever $x, y \in I$;
*  $x \wedge y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$.

The concept of ideal is dual to that of [[filter]].  A subset of $L$ that satisfies the first two of the three axioms for an ideal in a proset is precisely a [[direction|directed subset]] of $L$; notice that this is weaker than being a sub-join-semilattice even if $L$ is a lattice.


### In both at once

There are some common situations where these two kinds of ideal might seem to clash but fortunately do not:

* A [[distributive lattice]] is both a lattice and a commutative rig; the two concepts of ideal are the same, as can be seen by comparing the definition for rigs to the last definition for lattices.

* A [[Boolean algebra]] is a both a distributive lattice and a [[Boolean ring]]; again, the two concepts of ideal are the same (partly because the multiplication operators are the same, although there is still some checking to do regarding closure under addition).

On the other hand, every poset is a poset in an [[opposite poset|opposite]] way, and this does *not* give the same concept of ideal; an ideal in one is a [[filter]] in the opposite one.  We are lucky that the convention for interpreting a Boolean ring as a lattice goes in the correct direction, or the two notions of ideal in a Boolean algebra would not match; or perhaps it is not a matter of luck, but the convention for which way to define ideals in a lattice was chosen precisely to match the conventions for Boolean algebras!


### In monoids

There is a notion of ideal in a [[monoid]] (or even [[semigroup]]), or more generally in a [[monoid object]] in any [[monoidal category]] $C$, which generalises the notion of ideal in a ri(n)g or in a (semi)lattice.  That is, if $C$ is [[Ab]], then a monoid in $C$ is a [[ring]]; if $C$ is [[Ab Mon]], then a monoid in $C$ is a [[rig]]; and a [[semilattice]] is a commutative idempotent monoid in [[Set]].  A left (right) ideal in a monoid (or semigroup) is a subset closed under multiplications with arbitrary elements in the semigroup from the left (right). See [[ideal in a monoid]].

This generalizes all of the above notions of ideal *except* for ideals in prosets that are not (possibly unbounded) join-semilattices.


### In categories

More generally still, passing from monoids to their many-object version and from prosets to their many-morphism version, a right ideal or _[[sieve]]_ in a [[category]] is a subcategory closed under precomposition with morphisms from the entire category, and a cosieve or left ideal is the dual notion closed under postcompositions with morphisms in the entire category.  See [[sieve]].

### In additive categories 

In ringoids (small additive categories) and additive categories in general, a left/right/2-sided ideal is just the ideal (sieve/cosieve) in the sense of categories which is also closed under group operations in hom groups. 

## Kinds of ideals

Ideals form [[complete lattices]] where arbitrary meets are given by set-theoretic intersection. In other words, ideals form a [[Moore collection]] of subsets of $R$ if $R$ is a rig, or of $L$ if $L$ is a lattice. This implies we have an ideal __generated__ by any [[subset]]: the intersection of all ideals containing the subset.  A subset $S$ that generates a given ideal $I$ may be called a __[[subbase]]__ of $I$; then $S$ is a __[[base]]__ if every element of $I$ is a multiple (in a rig) or a predecessor (in an order) of some element of $S$.  (In particular, every [[singleton subset]] is a base of its generated ideal.)  See also [[filter base]] and dualize for more about bases and subbases of ideals in lattices and other posets.

Certain kinds of ideals are often characterized by the roles they play in ideal lattices, or in terms of the Moore [[closure operator]]. Some examples follow. 

The top element of an ideal lattice is called the *improper ideal*. That is to say, an ideal $I$ is the improper ideal if $x \in I$ for every $x$ (which follows if $1 \in I$ for the case of rigs, or $\top \in I$ for the case of bounded lattices). An ideal $I$ is _proper_ if it is not the improper ideal: if there exists an element $x$ such that $x \notin I$.  So in a [[rig]], $I$ is proper iff $1 \notin I$; in a (bounded) lattice, $I$ is proper iff $\top \notin I$. 

An ideal is a __[[maximal ideal]]__ if it is maximal among *proper* ideals.  A maximal ideal in a rig (including in a distributive lattice, but not in every lattice) is necessarily [[prime ideal|prime]]; conversely, a prime ideal in a [[Boolean algebra]] is necessarily maximal. 

An ideal $I$ is a __[[principal ideal]]__ if it is generated by a singleton. This means there exists an element $x \in I$ such that $y$ is a multiple of $x$ (in a rig) or $y \leq x$ (in an ordered set) whenever $y \in I$; we say that $I$ is __generated__ by $x$. Thus every element $x$ generates a unique principal ideal, the set of all left/right/two-sided multiples of $x$ ($a x$, $x b$, or $a x b$ if we are talking about left/right/two-sided ideals in a rig) or the [[downset]] of $x$ (in an an order). Clearly, every ideal $I$ is a join over all the principal ideals $P_x$ generated by the elements $x$ of $I$. 

As discussed at [[ideals in a monoid]], there is for two-sided ideals an operation of ideal multiplication, making the ideal lattice a [[quantale]] (cf. [[Day convolution]]). Namely, if $I, J$ are ideals, then their product $I J$ is the ideal generated by all products $x y$ with $x \in I, y \in J$ in the case of rigs. Similarly, in the case of lattices, we could define $I J$ to be the ideal generated by all meets $x \wedge y$ -- but in this case the result is the same as $I \cap J$. In any case, we say that a proper ideal $P$ is __[[prime ideal|prime]]__ if for any ideals $I, J$, the condition $I J \subseteq P$ implies $I \subseteq P$ or $J \subseteq P$. In [[order theory]], the term 'prime ideal' is usually used for a _[[strongly irreducible ideal]]_, since the two are equivalent for prosets.

An (left, right, or two-sided) ideal $I$ is __[[irreducible ideal|irreducible]]__ if it is proper and, whenever it is written as the [[intersection]] of two ideals (of the same kind) $I = J \cap K$, then at least one of $J$ and $K$ equals $I$.  If we replace equality here by containment, then we get something more analogous to the definition of prime ideal, called a __[[strongly irreducible ideal]]__.  (Indeed, for [[prosets]], prime ideals and strongly irreducible ideals are the same.)  In general, prime ideals are strongly irreducible, and strongly irreducible ideals are irreducible, but the converses fail.  An ideal is __[[completely irreducible ideal|completely irreducible]]__ if whenever $I$ is an intersection of any (possibly infinite) collection of ideals, $I$ is equal to at least one of them.  (This is _not_ analogous to [[completely prime ideals]].)

An ideal $I$ is a __nil ideal__ if for every $x\in I$, there is an $n\in \mathbb{N}$ with $x^n=0$. That is, every element of the ideal is nilpotent. If on the other hand, there is an $n\in \mathbb{N}$, such that for every $x\in I$, $x^n=0$, the ideal is called __nilpotent__.

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
A maximal ideal $M$ is prime. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Because the ideal lattice is a [[quantale]], multiplication of ideals distributes over ideal joins. Suppose $I J \subseteq M$ for two ideals $I, J$. If neither is contained in $M$, then $I \vee M = \top = J \vee M$ (the improper ideal) since $M$ is maximal. Then 

$$\top = \top \cdot \top = (I \vee M) \cdot (J \vee M) = I J \vee M J \vee I M \vee M M$$ 

where all four summands are contained in $M$ ($I J \subseteq M$ by supposition, and the other containments hold since $M$ is an ideal). Thus their join is contained in $M$, so we have proved $\top \subseteq M$, contradiction. 
=-- 

That every ideal is contained in a prime ideal is a [[prime ideal theorem]]; that every ideal is contained in a maximal ideal is a [[maximal ideal theorem]].

## Idea

A **surface** is a [[space]] of [[dimension]] 2.

In [[differential geometry]] this means a 2-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] or something thereby [[parametrization|parametrized]].

In [[complex analytic geometry]] this usually means a [[complex manifold]] of _complex_ dimension 2.

Similarly and more generally, in [[algebraic geometry]] an _[[algebraic surface]]_ is a [[variety]] of algebraic dimension 2.

## Definition

A [[magma]] $(S,\cdot)$ is called _unital_ if it has an [[identity element]] $1 \in S$, hence an element such that for all $x \in S$ it satisfies the [[equation]]

$$
  1 \cdot x = x = x \cdot 1
$$

holds. The identity element is [[idempotent]]. 

Some authors take a magma to be unital by default (cf. [[Borceux-Bourn]] Def. 1.2.1). 

There is also a possibly empty version, where the identity element is replaced with a [[constant function]] $1:S \to S$ such that for all $x,y \in S$, $1(x)\cdot y = y$ and $x\cdot 1(y) = x$. 

## Properties

The [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] holds for unital magmas: two compatible ones on a set must be equal, associative and commutative.

## Examples

Examples include [[unital rings]] etc.

## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[algebra]], a *subring* is a [[subobject]] of a [[ring]], i.e. a [[subobject]] of an [[object]] in the [[category]] [[Ring]] of rings with [[homomorphisms]] between them.

As usual, there is a little bit of variation of what exactly one takes to be the definition of "ring" (multiplicative [[unital magma|unitality]] is usually understood by default, while [[commutative ring|commutativity]] is usually not assumed by default) but in each case the general notion of [[subobject]] reduces to the appropriare notion of subring. For instance, a subring in the category of unital rings necessarily contains the [[unit]]-element of the ambient ring, etc.

## Definition

### For Lie algebras

Given a [[Lie algebra]] $L$ internal to some [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] $k$-linear category $C = (C,\otimes, \mathbf{1},\tau)$, an __enveloping monoid__ (or __enveloping algebra__) of $L$ in $C$ is any morphism $f: L\to Lie(A)$ of Lie algebras in $C$ where $A$ is a monoid (= algebra) in $C$, and $Lie(A)$ is the underlying object of $A$ equipped with the Lie bracket $[,]_{Lie(A)}=\mu-\mu\circ\tau_{A,A}$. In further we will just write $A$ for $Lie(A)$. A morphism of enveloping algebras $\phi : (f:L\to A)\to (f':L\to A')$ is a morphism $g: A\to A'$ of monoids completing a commutative triangle of morphisms in $C$, i.e. $g\circ f = f'$. With an obvious composition of morphisms, the enveloping algebras of $L$ form a category. A __universal enveloping algebra__ of $L$ in $C$ is any universal [[initial object]] $i_L:L\to U(L)$ in the category of enveloping algebras of $L$; it is of course unique up to an isomorphism if it exists. If it exists for all Lie algebras in $C$, then the rule $L\mapsto U(L)$ can be extended to a functor $U$ which is the left adjoint to the functor $Lie:A\mapsto Lie(A)$ defined above and the morphism $i_L:L\to U(L)$ is the unit of the adjunction. 

### For $L_\infty$-algebras

In the more general context of [[higher algebra]] there is a notion of universal enveloping [[E-n algebra]] of an [[L-infinity algebra]] for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ which generalizes the notion of universal associative algebra envelope of a Lie algebra. See at _[[universal enveloping E-n algebra]]_.

## Existence

The existence of the universal enveloping algebra is easy in many concrete symmetric monoidal categories, e.g. the symmetric monoidal category of bounded chain complexes (giving the universal enveloping [[differential graded algebra|dg-algebra]] of a [[differential graded Lie algebra|dg-Lie algebra]]), but not true in general. 

First of all if $C$ admits countable coproducts, form the tensor algebra $TL=\coprod_{n=0}^\infty L^{\otimes n}$ on the object $L$; this is a monoid in $C$.
In most standard cases, one can also form the smallest 2-sided ideal (i.e. $A$-subbimodule) $I$ in monoid $A$ among those ideals whose inclusion into $A$ is factorizing the map $([,]-m_{TL}+m_{TL}\circ\tau)\circ \otimes :L\otimes L\to TL$; if the coequalizers exist in $C$ then we can form the quotient object $TL/I$ and there is an induced monoid structure in it. Under mild conditions on $C$, the natural morphism $i_L:L\to TL/I$ is an universal enveloping monoid of $L$ in $C$. If $C$ is an abelian tensor category and some flatness conditions on the tensor product are satisfied, then the enveloping monoid $i_L:L\to TL/I$ is a monic morphism in $C$ and $U(L\coprod L)\cong U(L)\otimes U(L)$.

## Properties

### Isomorphism problem

The _isomorphism problem_ for enveloping algebras is about the fact that the universal enveloping monoids of two Lie algebras of $C$ are isomorphic as associative [[monoids]] in $C$, but this does not imply that the Lie algebras are isomorphic. This is even not true in general for the Lie $k$-algebras (in classical sense), even if $k$ is a [[field]] of characteristics zero. It is known however in that case that the dimension of the finite-dimensional Lie $k$-algebra $L$ can be read off from its universal enveloping $k$-algebra as its Gel'fand-Kirillov dimension $GK(U(L))$. 

### Poisson algebra structure on $U(\mathfrak{g})$

The universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$ of a [[Lie algebra]] is naturally a (non-commutative) [[Poisson algebra]] with the restriction of the Poisson bracket to generators being the original [[Lie bracket]]

### Hopf algebra structure on $U(\mathfrak{g})$

Suppose the universal enveloping algebras of Lie algebras exist in a $k$-linear symmetric monoidal category $C$ and the functorial choice $L\mapsto U(L)$ realizing the above construction with tensor products is fixed. For example, this is true in the category of $k$-[[modules]] where $k$ is a [[commutative ring]]. Then the projection $L\to 0$ (where $0$ is the trivial Lie algebra) induces the counit $\epsilon:U(L)\to U(0)=\mathbf{1}$. The coproduct $\Delta:U(L)\to U(L\times L)\cong U(L)\otimes U(L)$ is induced by the [[diagonal]] map $L\to L\times L$ whereas the antipode $S=U(-id):U(L)\to U(L)$. One checks that these morphisms make $U(L)$ into a [[Hopf algebra]] in $C$. (e.g [Milnor-Moore 65, section 5](#MilnorMoore65)) The _[[Milnor-Moore theorem]]_ states conditions under which the converse holds (hence under which a primitively generated Hopf algebra is a universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra).

If the category is simply the vector spaces over a field $k$, then for $l\in L$, after we identify $L$ with its image in $U(L)$, $\Delta(l) = l\otimes 1 + 1\otimes l$, i.e. the elements in $L$ are the [[primitive element]]s in $U(L)$. 

### PBW theorem

The [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] states that the 
[[associated graded]] algebra of an enveloping algebra $U(g)$ in [[characteristics zero]] is canonically isomorphic to a [[symmetric algebra]] $Sym(g)$, and $U(g)$ is isomorphic to $S(g)$ as a coalgebra, via the projection map $U(g)\to Gr U(g)$. 

### Relation to formal deformation quantization

See at _[[deformation quantization]]_ the section _[Relation to universal enveloping algebras](deformation+quantization#RelationToUniversalEnvelopingAlgebras)_.

## Examples

### Universal enveloping of a tangent Lie algebra

The universal enveloping algebra of the [[tangent Lie algebra]] of a 
finite-dimensional Lie group $G$ over real or complex numbers is canonically isomorphic to the algebra of the left invariant 
[[differential operators]] on $G$.

## What should a set be?

The concept of _set_ appears in several different guises in [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[category theory]].


It is common to use [[foundations of mathematics]] in which 'set' is an undefined term; this is [[set theory]] as a foundation.  In a [[pure set|pure]] [[material set theory]] like [[ZFC]], every object is a set.  Even in a [[structural set theory|structural approach]] such as [[ETCS]], it is common for every object to be a [[structured set]] in some way or another.

Even if sets are not at the bottom of your foundations, still they are probably close.  For instance, in [[type theory]] sometimes sets are defined as [[predicates]] on [[types]], or as [[setoids]].  In [[homotopy type theory]], sets are defined as [[truncated object|0-truncated]] homotopy types; see below.

Material set theory conflates two notions of sets, which were elegantly (but not first) described by [[Mathieu Dupont]] in [a blog post](http://math.breckes.org/2009/03/the-two-meanings-of-the-word-%E2%80%9Cset%E2%80%9D-in-mathematics/) as 'set&#185;' and 'set&#178;', which we will here call 'abstract set' and 'concrete set'.  In the latter case (set&#178;), we have some fixed [[universe of discourse]] (say, consisting of all real numbers), and a __concrete set__ is a set of elements of this universe (so a set of real numbers, such as $\{5\}$, $\{ x | x \gt 2 \}$, or $\empty$).  In the former case (set&#185;), an __abstract set__ is a purely abstract concept, an unstructured (except perhaps for the [[equality relation]]) collection of unlabelled elements.  Arguably (this argument goes back at least to [[Bill Lawvere|Lawvere]]), [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]\'s original concept of [[cardinal number]] (Kardinalzahl) was the abstraction from a concrete set to its underlying abstract set.

Here we adopt a structural approach, in which a __set__ is an abstract set, a (mostly) unstructured [[collection]].  For concrete sets, see [[subset]]; if the fixed universe of discourse is an abstract set $S$, then a concrete set will be a subset of $S$.  In material set theory (as usually conceived), the fixed universe of discourse is an abstract set (or [[proper class]]) $V$, an abstract set (internal to the theory) is an element of $V$, and a concrete set is a sufficiently [[small set|small]] subset of $V$; the concepts may be identified because $V$ comes with an [[bijection|isomorphism]] to its class of small subsets.


## What is a set?

We still need to clarify exactly what sort of collection a set is.  Although most foundations leave this unspecified, we may (perhaps circularly, and perhaps controversially) define it in various ways, as follows:

### In category theory

+-- {: .un_defn #AsCategory}
###### Definition

A __set__ is a [[category]] (or instead an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]] or even an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]]) that is [[small category|small]], [[discrete category|discrete]], and [[skeletal category|skeletal]]. (This definition needs explanation since it seems to be recursive, as "smallness" refers to what a set is.)
=--
Each of these three adjectives describes a different aspect of what makes something a 'set', and they serve different purposes, which should not be conflated.

That a set is (in the category-theoretic sense) [[discrete category|discrete]] is the most important point; nobody would call a category a 'set' merely because it is small and skeletal.  (This clause is also the reason why it makes no difference whether we start from categories, $\infty$-groupois, or $\infty$-categories; discreteness immediately limits us to $0$-[[0-groupoid|groupoids]].)  The discreteness of a set reflects its lack of internal structure; while a category may have much structure relating its objects, the only structure remaining in a discrete category is whether any two given objects are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (and the fact that isomorphism is an [[equivalence relation]]); if (and only if) they are, then they are considered __[[equality|equal]]__ as elements of the set.

That a set is [[small category|small]] allows there to be a collection of 'all' sets; this collection is not itself small, but we still have a [[large category]] of all sets, [[Set]].  A category that is merely discrete and skeletal may be called a __[[class]]__ instead.  But notice that the difference between a set and a class is a rather technical one; a class is just like a set, only (possibly) larger.  Indeed, not everyone would agree with the requirement that a set must be small; although that is probably the most common way of talking to deal with size issues, it is not the only way.  Another way, used by no less an authority than _[[Categories Work]]_, is to posit the existence of a strongly [[inaccessible cardinal]] $\kappa$ and define a __[[small set]]__ to be a set whose [[cardinality]] is less than $\kappa$.

That a set is [[skeletal category|skeletal]] is arguably the least important requirement; in fact, it violates the [[principle of equivalence]].  A category that is merely small and discrete may be called a __[[setoid]]__ instead.  However, if you forbid yourself from referring to [[equality]] of elements of the setoid (which are the objects of the small discrete category) --- or, equivalently, interpret "equality" to mean "isomorphism" therein --- then you cannot distinguish the setoid from a set; each is merely a (small) collection of elements with an equivalence relation (called 'equivalence' in the setoid and 'equality' in the set, in both cases corresponding to isomorphism in a small discrete category).  While [[size issues]] are real and cannot be ignored completely, it is possible to adopt foundations in which the issue of skeletality simply does not appear.


### In homotopy type theory {#InHoTT}

As [[homotopy type theory]] may be viewed as a theory of $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]], it falls under the preceding section; but since the language of HoTT is important to learn, let us look at it explicitly:
+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **set** is a [[type]] in which there is an operation connecting any two parallel [[identity type|paths]] by a 2-path:

    Definition is_set A := forall (x y : A) (p q : x == y), p == q

(There are numerous other equivalent definitions; see [[h-set]].)
=--
Because this operation is defined internally, it acts on paths as well as points and implies that, for any two points of $A$, the [[identity type|type of paths]] between them is [[contractible space|contractible]] as soon as it is [[inhabited]].

Regarding types as [[∞-groupoids]], this definition takes care only of the discreteness requirement.  Regarding smallness, HoTT is usually formulated in [[Martin-Löf type theory]] with [[universes]] ([[type of types]]).  If we have chosen one particular universe as the universe of "small" things, then "setness" could be restricted to types belonging to that universe.

Finally, skeletality is mostly meaningless in HoTT because paths are the only notion of (propositional) [[equality]] which we have to reason with.  (There is also the notion of "definitional" equality, but as we cannot assert or prove statements of the form "$x$ and $y$ are definitionally equal" inside the theory, this is mostly not relevant for the purposes of setness.)

###### Definition

A ([[topological space|topological]]) [[space]] whose only [[connected topological space|connected]] [[subspaces]] are [[singletons]] is called *totally disconnected*.

## Examples

###### Example

[[discrete space|Discrete spaces]] are totally disconnected.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #RationalNumbersAreTotallyDisconnected}
###### Example
**(the rational numbers are totally disconnected)**

The [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ equipped with their [[subspace topology]] inherited from the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] on the [[real numbers]], form a totally disconnected space.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By construction, a [[base for a topology|base for the topology]] is given by the open subsets which are restrictions of [[open intervals]] of real numbers to the rational numbers

$$
  (a,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} \coloneqq (a,b) \cap \mathbb{Q}
$$

for $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$.

Now for any such $a \lt b$ there exists an [[irrational number]] $r \in \mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$ with $a \lt r \lt b$. This being irrational implies that $(a,r)_{\mathbb{Q}} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ and $(r,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ are disjoint subsets. Therefore every basic open subset is the disjoint union of (at least) two open subsets:

$$
  (a,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} = (a,r)_{\mathbb{Q}} \cup (r,b)_{\mathbb{Q}}
  \,.
$$

Hence no [[inhabited set|inhabited]] open subspace of the rational numbers is connected.

+-- {: .num_example #limits} 
###### Example 
A [[product]] in $Top$ of totally disconnected spaces is totally disconnected. A subspace of a totally disconnected space is totally disconnected. Hence [[limits]] in $Top$ of diagrams of totally disconnected spaces are totally disconnected. 
=-- 

For example, the [[Baire space]] of [[irrational numbers]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[countable set|countable]] [[product space]] $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$ (via [[continued fractions]]), so it is totally disconnected. Similarly, [[Cantor space]] $2^\mathbb{N}$ is totally disconnected. Another notable special case of the preceding class of examples is the following.

Every [[profinite group]] is totally disconnected and in particular the set of [[p-adic number|p-adic numbers]] is totally disconnected.

The general class of examples in Example \ref{limits} may be seen in the following light. 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
The [[category]] of totally disconnected spaces and continuous maps is a [[reflective subcategory]] of [[Top]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The reflector takes a space $X$ to the space of connected components, i.e., the [[quotient space]] $X/\sim$ of $X$ where $\sim$-equivalence classes are precisely the connected components of $X$. We check that connected components $C$ of $X/\sim$ are singletons. Let $q: X \to X/\sim$ be the quotient map; it suffices to check that $q^{-1}(C) \subseteq X$ is connected (because then $q^{-1}(C)$ is contained in a single $\sim$-equivalence class, making $C = q q^{-1}(C)$ a single point). So, suppose the (closed) set $q^{-1}(C)$ is a disjoint union $K_1 + K_2$ of closed sets $K_1, K_2$; we are required to show one or the other is empty. For each $c \in C$, the inverse image $q^{-1}(\{c\})$ is connected, hence we must have $q^{-1}(\{c\}) \subseteq K_1$ or $q^{-1}(\{c\}) \subseteq K_2$. Thus we can partition $C$ into sets 

$$C_1 \coloneqq \{c \in C: q^{-1}(\{c\}) \subseteq K_1\}, \qquad C_2 \coloneqq \{c \in C: q^{-1}(\{c\}) \subseteq K_2\}$$ 

and we observe $q^{-1}(C_1) = K_1$ and $q^{-1}(C_2) = K_2$. By definition of quotient topology, since $K_1, K_2$ are closed we infer $C_1, C_2$ are closed. They are also disjoint and $C = C_1 + C_2$, so by connectedness of $C$ either $C_1 = \emptyset$ or $C_2 = \emptyset$, and therefore $K_1 = q^{-1}(C_1)$ or $K_2 = q^{-1}(C_2)$ is empty, as required. 

Finally, given a continuous map $f: X \to Y$ with $Y$ totally disconnected, each connected component $C$ of $X$ is mapped to a connected set $f(C)$ of $Y$ which is a singleton by total disconnectedness of $Y$, and so we get a (unique) factoring through a map $X/\sim \to Y$, continuous of course by virtue of the quotient topology. This completes the proof.

## Definition


Given a [[function]] $f: X \to Y$ and a [[subset]] $S$ of $Y$, the __preimage__ (sometimes also called the __[[inverse image]]__, though that may mean something different) of $S$ under $f$ is a [[subset]] of $X$, consisting of those arguments whose values belong to $S$.  

That is,
$$ f^*(S) = \{ a: X \;|\; f(a) \in S \} .$$
A traditional notation for $f^*$ is $f^{-1}$, but this can conflict with the notation for an [[inverse function]] of $f$ (which indeed might not even exist). In fact $f^\ast$ is borrowed from a notation for [[pullbacks]]; indeed, a preimage is an example of a pullback: 

$$\array{
f^\ast(S) & \hookrightarrow & X \\ 
\downarrow & (pb) & \downarrow \mathrlap{f} \\ 
S & \hookrightarrow & Y
}$$ 

Notice also that $f^\ast$ may be regarded as an operator $P(Y) \to P(X)$ between [[power sets]]. Power sets $P(X)$ are [[exponential objects]] $2^X$ in the [[topos]] $Set$; under this identification the pre-image operator $f^\ast$ is thereby identified with the map $2^f: 2^Y \to 2^X$ (variously called "pulling back along $f$ or substituting along $f$) obtained by [[currying]] the composite map 

$$2^Y \times X \stackrel{1 \times f}{\to} 2^Y \times Y \stackrel{eval}{\to} 2.$$ 

The appearance of the asterisk as a *superscript* in $f^\ast$ serves as a reminder of the [[contravariant functor|contravariance]] of the map $f \mapsto f^\ast = 2^f$. Similarly, one uses a subscript notation such as $f_*$ (or sometimes $f_!$) for the direct [[image]], considered as an operator $f_\ast: 2^X \to 2^Y$ in the *covariant* direction. 

Naturally all of this generalizes to the context of [[toposes]], where the set $2$ is replaced by the [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ and $f^\ast = \Omega^f$, with a pullback description similar to the above. 


## Properties

* [[interactions of images and pre-images with unions and intersections]]:

  * [[pre-images preserve unions and intersections]] (a general reason for this being that unions are colimits, intersections are limits, and $f^\ast$ is simultaneously a left- and a right-adjoint: $f^\ast$ is right-adjoint to the [[existential quantifier]] $\exists_f$ and left-adjoint to the [[universal quantifier]] $\forall_f$) 

As emphasized by [Lawvere](#Lawvere73), the quantifiers $\exists_f, \forall_f$ are vastly generalized by the concept of [[enriched category theory|enriched]] [[Kan extensions]] which provide left and right adjoints to pulling-back operators $V^f: V^D \to V^C$ for $V$-enriched functors $f: C \to D$. 

## Iterated preimages

For [[partial function|partial]] [[endofunctions]], one could also consider iterating the construction of the preimage of the partial endofunction. 

For every [[set]] $T$ and [[subset]] $S \subseteq T$, let $f:S \to T$ be a function from the subset $S$ to $T$. Given any subset $R \subseteq T$, the preimage $f^{-1}(R)$ by definition is a subset of $S$ and thus a subset of $T$. One could restrict the domain of $f$ to $f^{-1}(R)$ and the codomain of $f$ to $R$, and find the preimage of $f^{-1}(R)$ under $f$, or the 2-fold iterated preimage of $R$ under $f$:

$$f^{-2}(R) \coloneqq \{x \in S \vert \exists b \in f^{-1}(R).f(x) = b\}$$

One could repeat this definition indefinitely, which could be formalised by the indexed sets $f^{-n}(R)$ representing the __$n$-fold iterated preimage of $R$ under $f$__. 

$$f^{-0}(R) \coloneqq R$$

and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$,

$$f^{-(n+1)}(S) \coloneqq \{x \in S \vert \exists b \in f^{-(n)}(R).f(x) = b\}$$

One example of an iterated preimage is the set of [[iterated differentiable functions]] and the iterated [[continuously differentiable functions]] $C^n(\mathbb{R})$, which are the $n$-th iterated preimage of all functions and [[pointwise continuous functions]] on the [[real numbers]] under the [[derivative]]/[[Newton-Leibniz operator]] respectively. 

## Infinitely iterated preimages

The above definition of an iterated preimage is [[inductive]]; one could also consider the [[coinductive]] version of above. This leads to infinitely iterated preimages: 

For every set $T$ and subset $S \subseteq T$, let $f:S \to T$ be a function from the subset $S$ to $T$. Given any subset $R \subseteq T$, the infinitely iterated preimage is defined as the largest subset $f^{-\infty}(R) \subseteq T$ such that the preimage of $f^{-\infty}(R)$ under $f$ is $f^{-\infty}(R)$ itself.

One example of an infinitely iterated preimage is the set of [[smooth functions]]  $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, which is the infinitely iterated preimage of [[pointwise continuous functions]] under the [[derivative]]/[[Newton-Leibniz operator]].

## Definition 

### In set theory

In [[set theory]], a **span** or **correspondence** between [[sets]] $A$ and $B$ is a set $C$ with a [[function]] $R:C \to A \times B$ to the [[product set]] $A \times B$. A span between a set $A$ and $A$ itself is a [[directed pseudograph]], which is used to define [[categories]] in set theory. 

### In dependent type theory

In [[dependent type theory]], there is a distinction between a *span*, a *multivalued partial function*, and a *correspondence*:

* A **span** between types $A$ and $B$ is a type $C$ with families of elements $x:C \vdash g(x):A$ and $x:C \vdash h(x):B$

* A **[[multivalued partial function]]** from type $A$ to type $B$ is a type family $x:A \vdash P(x)$ with a family of elements $x:A, p:P(x) \vdash f(x, p):B$

* A **correspondence** between types $A$ and $B$ is a type family $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$. 

However, from any one of the above structures, one could get the other two structures, provided one has [[identity types]] and [[dependent pair types]] in the dependent type theory. Given a type family $x:A \vdash P(x)$, let $z:\sum_{x:A} P(x) \vdash \pi_1(z):A$ and $z:\sum_{x:A} P(x) \vdash \pi_2(z):P(\pi_1(z))$ be the dependent pair projections for the [[dependent pair type]] $\sum_{x:A} P(x)$. 

* From every span one could get a multivalued partial function by defining the type family $x:A \vdash P(x)$ as $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{y:C} g(y) =_A x$ and the family of elements $x:A, p:P(x) \vdash f(x, p):B$ as $f(x, p) \coloneqq h(\pi_1(x))$. 

* From every multivalued partial function one could get a span by defining the type $C$ as $C \coloneqq \sum_{x:A} P(x)$ and the family of elements $x:C \vdash g(x):A$ as $g(x) \coloneqq \pi_1(x)$. 

* From every multivalued partial function one could get a correspondence by defining the type family $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$ as $R(x, y) \coloneqq \sum_{p:P(x)} f(x, p) =_B y$. 

* From every correspondence one could get a multivalued partial function by defining the type family $x:A \vdash P(x)$ as $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{y:B} R(x, y)$, and the family of elements $x:A, p:P(x) \vdash h(x, p):B$ as $h(x, p) \coloneqq \pi_1(p)$

* From every span one could get a correspondence by defining the type family $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$ as $R(x, y) \coloneqq \sum_{z:C} (g(z) =_A x) \times (h(z) =_B y)$. 

* From every correspondence one could get a span by defining the type $C$ as $C \coloneqq \sum_{x:A} \sum_{y:B} R(x, y)$, the family of elements $z:C \vdash g(z):A$ as $g(z) \coloneqq \pi_1(z)$, and the function $z:C \vdash h(z):B$ as $h(z) \coloneqq \pi_1(\pi_2(z))$ 

Given types $A$, $B$, and $C$ and spans $(D, x:D \vdash g_D(x):A, x:D \vdash h_D(x):B)$ between $A$ and $B$ and $(E, y:E \vdash g_E(y):B, y:E \vdash h_E(y):C)$ between $B$ and $C$, there is a span 
$$(E \circ D, z:E \circ D \vdash g_{E \circ D}(z):A, z:E \circ D \vdash h_{E \circ D}(z):C)$$ 
defined by
$$E \circ D \coloneqq \sum_{x:D} \sum_{y:E} h_D(x) =_B g_E(y)$$
$$z:E \circ D \vdash g_{E \circ D}(z) \coloneqq g_D(\pi_1(z))$$
$$z:E \circ D \vdash h_{E \circ D}(z) \coloneqq h_E(\pi_1(\pi_2(\pi_1(z))(z)))$$

Given types $A$, $B$, and $C$ and correspondences $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$ and $y:B, z:C \vdash S(y, z)$, there is a correspondence $x:A, z:C \vdash (S \circ R)(x, z)$ defined by 
$$(S \circ R)(x, z) \coloneqq \sum_{y:B} R(x, y) \times S(y, z)$$


### In category theory

In any [[category]] $C$, a __span__, or __roof__, or __correspondence__, from an [[object]] $x$ to an object $y$ is a [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     && s
      \\
      & {}^{f}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{g}
     \\
     x
     &&&&
     y
  }
$$

where $s$ is some other object of the category.  (The word "correspondence" is also sometimes used for a [[profunctor]].)

This [[diagram]] is also called a 'span' because it looks like a little bridge; 'roof' is similar.  The term 'correspondence' is prevalent in geometry and related areas; it comes about because a correspondence is a generalisation of a binary [[relation]].  

Note that a span with $f = 1$ is just a morphism from $x$ to $y$, while a span with $g = 1$ is a morphism from $y$ to $x$.  So, a span can be thought of as a generalization of a morphism in which there is no longer any asymmetry between source and target.

A span in the [[opposite category]] $C^op$ is called a [[co-span]] in $C$.  

A span that has a [[cocone]] is called a [[coquadrable span]].

### Categories of spans

If the category $C$ has [[pullback|pullbacks]], we can compose spans.  Namely, given a span from $x$ to $y$ and a span from $y$ to $z$:
$$
  \array{
     && s &&&& t
      \\
      & {}^{f}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{g}
       &
       & {}^{h}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{i}
     \\
     x
     &&&&
     y
     &&&&
     z
  }
$$

we can take a pullback in the middle:

$$
  \array{
     &&&& s \times_y t 
     \\& 
    &&
      {}^{p_s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{p_t}
    \\
     && s &&&& t
      \\
      & {}^{f}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{g}
       &
       & {}^{h}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{i}
     \\
     x
     &&&&
     y
     &&&&
     z
  }
$$

and obtain a span from $x$ to $z$:

$$
  \array{
     && s \times_y t
      \\
      & {}^{f p_s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{i p_t}
     \\
     x
     &&&&
     z
  }
$$

This way of composing spans lets us define a [[bicategory]] [[Span]]$(C)$ with:

* objects of $C$ as objects
* spans as morphisms
* maps between spans as 2-morphisms

This is a weak 2-category: it has a nontrivial [[associator]]: composition of spans is not strictly associative, because pullbacks are defined only up to canonical isomorphism.  A [[Lack's coherence theorem|naturally defined]] [[strict 2-category]] which is equivalent to $Span(C)$ is the strict 2-category of [[linear polynomial functors]] between [[slice categories]] of $C$.

(Note that we must choose a specific pullback when defining the composite of a pair of morphisms in $Span(C)$, if we want to obtain a [[bicategory]] as traditionally defined; this requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Otherwise we obtain a bicategory with 'composites of morphisms defined only up to canonical iso-2-morphism'; such a structure can be modeled by an [[anabicategory]] or an [[opetopic bicategory]].)

By including functions as well, instead of a bicategory we obtain a [[pseudo-double category]].

## Properties

### The 1-category of spans

Let $C$ be a category with [[pullback]]s and let $Span_1(C) := (Span(C))_{\sim 1}$ be the 1-category of objects of $C$ and isomorphism classes of spans between them as morphisms.

Then

* $Span_1(C)$ is a [[dagger category]].

Next assume that $C$ is a [[cartesian monoidal category]]. Then clearly $Span_1(C)$ naturally becomes a [[monoidal category]] itself, but more: then

* $Span_1(C)$ is a [[dagger compact category]].


### Universal property of the bicategory of spans
 {#UniversalPropertyOfTheBicategoryOfSpans}

We discuss the [[universal property]] that characterizes 2-categories of spans. 

For $C$ be a [[category]] with [[pullbacks]], write 

1. $Span_2(C) \coloneqq (Span(C))_{\sim2}$ for the [[weak 2-category]] of objects of $C$, spans as morphisms, and maps between spans as 2-morphisms, 

1. $\eta_C: C \rightarrow Span_2(C)$ for the functor given by:

\begin{centre}
\begin{tikzcd}
  & & & & 
  x 
  \arrow[ld, "1_x"{above}] 
  \arrow[rd, "f"] 
  & 
  \\
  x 
  \arrow[r, "f"] 
  & 
  y 
  & 
  \mapsto 
  & 
  x 
  & & 
  y
\end{tikzcd}
\end{centre}

Now let

1. $K$ be any [[bicategory]]

1. $F, G \,\colon\, C \rightarrow K$ be [[functors]] such that every map in $C$ is sent to a map in $K$ possessing a [[right adjoint]] and satisfying the [[Beck-Chevalley Condition]] for any [[commutative square]] in $K$, 

1. $\alpha \,\colon\, F \rightarrow G$ be a [[natural transformation]].

Then: 

\begin{proposition}
**(universal property of the bicategory of spans)**
\linebreak
The following holds:

1. $\eta_C$ is [[universal]] among such functors $F$, i.e. $F$ as above factors as $F = \hat{F} \circ \eta_C$ for a functor $\hat{F} \,\colon\, Span_2(C) \rightarrow K$ which is unique up to isomorphism.

1. There exists a unique [[lax natural transformation]]: $\hat{\alpha} \,\colon\, \hat{F} \rightarrow \hat{G}$ such that $\hat{\alpha} \eta_C = \alpha$. 

1. Let $x, y$ be objects in $C$ and $f: x \rightarrow y$ be a morphism in $C$. If $(\alpha_x, \alpha_y)$ induce a pseudo-map of adjoints $F(f) \dashv (Ff)^* \rightarrow G(f) \dashv (Gf)^*$, then $\hat{\alpha}$ is a [[pseudonatural transformation]]

Furthermore, if we denote $Pbk$ as the [[2-category]] of categories with pullbacks, [[pullback]]-preserving [[functor]]s, and [[equifibered natural transformation]]s and $BiCat$ as the [[tricategory]] of [[bicategories]], $Span(-): Pbk \rightarrow BiCat$ is well-defined as a functor. 
\end{proposition}
This is due to [Hermida 1999](#Hermida99).


### Limits and colimits
 {#LimitsAndColimits}

Since a category of spans/correspondences $Corr(\mathcal{C})$ is evidently [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to its [[opposite category]], it follows that to the extent that [[limits]] exists they are also [[colimits]] and vice versa.

If the underlying category $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[extensive category]], then the [[coproduct]]/[[product]] in $Corr(\mathcal{C})$ is given by the [[disjoint union]] in $\mathcal{C}$. (See also [this](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/32526/what-is-the-product-in-the-2-category-of-spans) MO discussion).

More generally, every [[van Kampen colimit]] in $\mathcal{C}$ is a (co)limit in $Corr(\mathcal{C})$ &#8212; and conversely, this property characterizes van Kampen colimits. ([Sobocinski-Heindel 11](SobocinskiHeindel11)).

### Relation to relations
 {#RelationToRelations}

Correspondences may be seen as generalizations of [[relations]]. A relation is a [[correspondence]] which is [[(-1)-truncated]] as a [[morphism]] into the [[cartesian product]]. See at _[[relation]]_ and at _[[Rel]]_ for more on this.

## Examples

* Spans in [[FinSet]] behave like the [[categorification]] of  [[matrices]] with entries in the [[natural number]]s: for $X_1 \leftarrow N \to X_2$ a span of finite sets, the [[cardinality]] of the [[fiber]] $X_{x_1, x_2}$ over any two elements $x_1 \in X_1$ and $x_2 \in X_2$ plays the role of the corresponding matrix entry. Under this identification composition of spans indeed corresponds to matrix multiplication. This implies that the category of spans of finite sets is equivalent to the [[Lawvere theory]] of commutative monoids, that is, to the [[PROP]] for the free bicommutative [[bialgebra]].  Spans over finite sets is a [[rig category]] with respect to the tensor products induced by the coproduct and product in FinSet.  The coproduct in FinSet remains the coproduct, but the product becomes the bilinear [[tensor product of modules]].


* The [[Burnside category]] is essentially the category of correspondences in [[G-sets]] for $G$ a [[finite group]].

* A [[cobordism]] $\Sigma$ from $\Sigma_{in}$ to $\Sigma_{out}$ is an example of a cospan $\Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}$ in the category of [[smooth manifold]]s. However, composition of cobordisms is not quite the pushout-composition of these cospans: to make the composition be a [[smooth manifold]] again some extra technical aspects must be added ("[[collars]]").

* In [[prequantum field theory]] (see there for details), spans of [[stacks]] model [[trajectories]] of [[field (physics)|fields]].

* The [[category of Chow motives]] has as [[morphisms]] [[equivalence classes]] of [[linear combinations]] of spans of [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[projective varieties]].

* The [[Weinstein symplectic category]] has as morphisms [[Lagrangian correspondences]] between [[symplectic manifolds]]. 

  More generally [[symplectic dual pairs]] are correspondences between [[Poisson manifolds]].

* Cospans of homomorphisms of [[C*-algebras]] represent morphisms in [[KK-theory]] (by Cuntz' result).

* Correspondences of [[flag manifolds]] play a role as [[twistor correspondences]], see at _[Schubert calculus -- Correspondences](Schubert+calculus#Correspondences)_ and at _[[horocycle correspondence]]_

* The [[Fourier-Mukai transform]] is a pull-push operation through correspondences equipped with objects in a cocycle given by an object in a [[derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves]].

* [[Hecke correspondence]]

* A [[hypergraph]] is a span from a set of vertices to a set of (hyper)edges.

## Idea 

The [[permutations]] of a [[set]] $X$ form a [[group]], $S_X$, under [[composition]].  This is especially clear if one thinks of the permutation as a [[bijection]] on $X$, where the multiplication / composition is just composition of [[functions]]. This group is called the _symmetric group_ of $X$ and often denoted $S_X$, $\Sigma_X$, $Sym(X)$ or similar.

The [[subgroups]] of symmetric groups are the _[[permutation groups]]_.

When $X$ is [[the]] [[finite set]] $(n) = \{1,\dots,n\}$, then its symmetric group is a [[finite group]] of [[cardinality]] $n!$ = "$n$ [[factorial]]", and one typically writes $S_n$ or $\Sigma_n$. 

(We will make frequent use of the entry [[permutation]] for some key notation and concepts.)

In general, an element of $S_n$ can be represented by a two row array

$$\sigma= \left(\array{1&2&\ldots &n\\\sigma(1)&\sigma(2)&\ldots&\sigma(n)}\right).$$

It can also be given in cycle notation. We repeat the example from the entry on [[permutations]]. This is from $S_6$:

Let $\sigma$ be the permutation on $(6)$ defined by

$$\sigma = (\array{1 \mapsto 1 & 2\mapsto 4 & 3 \mapsto 5 & 4 \mapsto 6 & 5 \mapsto 3 & 6 \mapsto 2})= \left(\array{1&2&3&4&5&6\\1&4&5&6&3&2}\right)$$

The domain of the permutation is partitioned into three $\langle\sigma\rangle$-orbits 

$$(6) = \{1\} \cup \{2,4,6\} \cup \{3,5\}$$

corresponding to the three cycles

$$1 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 1 \qquad
2 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 4 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 6 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 2 \qquad
3 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 5 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 3$$

We express this more compactly by writing $\sigma$ as the composition $\sigma = (1)(2\,4\,6)(3\,5)$, or $\sigma = (2\,4\,6)(3\,5)$ leaving implicit the action of the identity (1).

We can also write $\sigma$ as a product of transpositions

$$(2\,4)(2\,6)(3\,5)$$



## Examples

### The symmetric group  $S_3$

$S_3$ is the group of permutations of $(3)=\{1,2,3\}$.

One simple way to represent an element of $S_3$ is by listing the $(3)$ on the top row of an array with a second row denoting the image of each element under the permutation.  For instance, the element $sigma= (1\mapsto 2, 2\mapsto 1, 3\mapsto 3)$ can be written more compactly as 

$$\sigma= \left(\array{1&2&3\\2&1&3}\right).$$

We can also use, even more compactly, 'cycle notation', as explained in more detail at [[permutation]], in which successive images under the permutation, $\sigma$, are listed until you get back to where you started. Elements of (3), or more generally of (n),  are usually not listed as cycles of length 1, exept that (1) may be used to indicate the identity element. For the above permutation, this gives

$$\sigma = (1\,2)$$

the _transposition_ exchanging the elements 1 and 2 and leaving 3 'unmoved'.  Whilst the 3-cycle, $(1\,2\,3)$, shifts every element to the right one position and then maps 3 to 1. 

\begin{example}\label{CayleyGraphOfSym3}
**([[Cayley graph of Sym(3)]])**
The following shows the [[Cayley graph]] of the [[symmetric groups]] on 3 elements, $Sym(3)$, with [[edges]] corresponding to any [[transposition]] (not necessarily adjacent), hence whose [[graph distance]] is the [[Cayley distance]]:

### The symmetric group $S_4$

The symmetric group on 4 elements is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the full [[tetrahedral group]] as well as to the orientation-preserving [[octahedral group]].



## Properties


### Cycle decomposition

As an element of the [[symmetric group]] $S_X$, every permutation $\sigma : X \to X$ generates a [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] $\langle \sigma \rangle$, and hence inherits a [[group action]] on $X$.  The [[orbits]] of this action partition the set $X$ into a disjoint union of cycles, called the **cyclic decomposition** of the permutation $\sigma$.

For example, let $\sigma$ be the permutation on $(6)$ defined by

$$\sigma = (\array{1 \mapsto 1 & 2 \mapsto 4 & 3 \mapsto 5 & 4 \mapsto 6 & 5 \mapsto 3 & 6 \mapsto 2})$$

The domain of the permutation is partitioned into three $\langle\sigma\rangle$-orbits 

$$(6) = \{1\} \cup \{2,4,6\} \cup \{3,5\}$$

corresponding to the three cycles

$$1 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 1 \qquad
2 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 4 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 6 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 2 \qquad
3 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 5 \underset{\sigma}{\to} 3$$

We can express this more compactly by writing $\sigma$ in "cycle notation", as the composition $\sigma = (1)(2\,4\,6)(3\,5)$, or $\sigma = (2\,4\,6)(3\,5)$ leaving implicit the action of the identity (1).


Even in the simple example of $S_3$ one can see some patterns. 

* $(12)$ clearly has order 2, whilst $(123)$ has square $(132)$, which is also the inverse of $(123)$, and has order 3.

* $(123) = (12)(13)$, so transpositions generate the whole group.

This gives a listing of the elements of $S_3$ as 

$$\{ 1, (12),(13),(23),(123),(132)\}.$$

* $S_3$ has a [[group presentation|presentation]]

$$\langle a,b | a^3, b^2,(a b)^2 \rangle.$$

where $a$ corresponds to the 3-cycle, $(123)$, whilst $b$ corresponds to any transposition.  It also has a presentation in which the generators correspond to the transpositions:

$$\langle \sigma_1,\sigma_2 | \sigma_1^2,\sigma_2^2, (\sigma_1\sigma_2)^3\rangle$$

It is easy to see that these relations imply that 

$$\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_1= \sigma_2\sigma_1\sigma_2$$

which relates this symmetric group to the [[braid group]], **Br 3**, and to the [[trefoil knot|trefoil group]].  It is clear that there is an epimorphism $S_3\to Br_3$ obtained by making the two braid generators become the transpositions.

###### Proposition
**([[conjugacy classes]] of the [[symmetric group]] labeled by [[partitions]] by [[cycle]] lengths)** \linebreak

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\Sigma(n)$ the [[symmetric group]]
on $n$ elements. Then the [[conjugacy classes]] of elements of $\Sigma(n)$, hence of [[permutations]] of $n$ elements, correspond to the [[cycle]] structures: two elements are conjugate to each other precisely if they have the same number $\# cycles \in \mathbb{N}$ of distinct [[cycles]] of the same lengths $(l_1 \geq l_2 \geq \cdots \geq l_{\#cycles})$, hence equivalently if they define the same underlying [[partition]]

### Representation theory

See at *[[representation theory of the symmetric group]]*.

### Relation to the field with one element

One may regard the symmetric group $S_n$ as the [[general linear group]] in dimension $n$ on the [[field with one element]]  $GL(n,\mathbb{F}_1)$.

See [there](field+with+one+element#AlgebraOverF1).


### Classifying space and universal Thom space
 {#ClassifyingSpaceAndThomSpace}

The [[classifying space]] $B \Sigma(n)$ of the symmetric group on $n$ elements may be presented by $Emb(\{1,\cdots, n\}, \mathbb{R}^\infty)/\Sigma(n)$, the [[Fadell's configuration space]] on $n$ unordered points in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$.


(e.g. [Bödigheimer 87, Example 10](#Boedigheimer87))

Write $\tau_n$ for the [[rank]] $n$ [[vector bundle]] over this which exhibits the canonical [[action]] of $\Sigma(n)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, by permutation of [[coordinates]].

The [[Thom space]] $B \Sigma(n)^{\tau_n}$ of this bundle appears as the cofficients of the [[spectral symmetric algebra]] of the "absolute [[spectral superpoint]]" $Sym_{\mathbb{S}} \Sigma \mathbb{S}$ (see [Rezk 10, slide 4](spectral%20symmetric%20algebra#Rezk10)).

### Whitehead tower and relation to supersymmetry
 {#WhiteheadTowerAndSupersymmetry}

The [[symmetric groups]] and [[alternating groups]] are the first stages in a restriction of the [[Whitehead tower]] of the [[orthogonal group]] to "finite [[discrete ∞-groups]]" in the sense of [[homotopy type with finite homotopy groups]]. The [[homotopy fibers]] of the stages of the "finite Whitehead tower" are the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] ([Epa-Ganter 16](#EpaGanter16)). (See also at _[super algebra -- Abstract idea](super+algebra#AbstractIdea)_ and at _[[Platonic 2-group]]_.)

Notice that the squares on the right are _not_ [[homotopy pullback]] squares. (The homotopy pullback of the [[string 2-group]] along $\tilde A \hookrightarrow Spin(n)$ is a $\mathbf{B}U(1)$-extension of $\tilde  A$, but here we get the universal _finite_ 2-group extension, by $\mathbb{Z}/24$ instead.

### Cardinality of symmetric groups

Recall that two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same [[cardinality]] if $A$ is in [[bijection]] with $B$. 

Given a [[natural number]] $n:\mathbb{N}$, the symmetric group on [[generalized the|the]] [[finite set]] with $n$ elements $\Sigma(n)$ is in bijection with the [[finite set]] $\mathrm{Fin}(n!)$ elements, where $n!$ is the [[factorial]] of $n$. 

The symmetric group on the natural numbers $\mathrm{Sym}(\mathbb{N})$ is an [[uncountable set]] in [[bijection]] with the endofunction set $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$. In the context of [[excluded middle]], this is in bijection with $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$, the [[power set]] of the natural numbers. 

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], given an [[infinite set]] $A$, there is a [[bijection]] $\mathrm{Sym}(A) \cong \mathcal{P}(A)$ between the symmetric group of $A$ and the [[power set]] of $A$.

## Idea

A [[module]] over a [[ring]] whose underlying [[abelian group]] has trivial [[torsion subgroup]] is called _torsion-free_.

## Definition 

### Torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules

In classical mathematics, a **torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-module** or **torsion free [[abelian group]]** $M$ could be defined using a variant of the zero-divisor property characteristic of [[integral domains]]: for all $r$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $m$ in $M$, if $r m = 0$, then $r = 0$ or $m = 0$, or the [[contrapositive]], if $r \neq 0$ and $m \neq 0$, then $r m \neq 0$. 

There is also an equivalent definition: a **torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-module** $M$ or **torsion free abelian group** is such that right multiplication by $m$ is injective if $m \neq 0$ and left multiplication by $r$ is injective if $r \neq 0$, where "multiplication" refers to the $\mathbb{Z}$-action. 

In [[constructive mathematics]], there are multiple inequivalent ways of defining a torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-module. One could define a torsion-free module as a module such that for all $r$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $m$ in $M$, if $r m = 0$, then $r = 0$ and $m = 0$. The first definition is valid in all modules with [[decidable equality]], and could be defined using [[coherent logic]], but is not valid for $\mathbb{R}$-modules. 

If the module has a [[tight apartness relation]], then one could define a torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-module as a module such that for all $r$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $m$ in $M$, if $r \neq 0$ and $m \# 0$, then $r m \# 0$. This is valid in $\mathbb{R}$, but is no longer capable of being defined in coherent logic. Similarly, one could define a torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-module $M$ is such that right multiplication by $m$ is injective if $m \# 0$ and left multiplication by $r$ is injective if $r \neq 0$. 

A torsion-free ring is a [[monoid object]] in torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules. 

### Torsion-free $R$-modules

In classical mathematics, given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, a **torsion-free $R$-module** is a module $M$ such that for all $r$ in $Can(R)$, where $Can(R)$ is the [[multiplicative submonoid of cancellative elements]] in $R$ and $m$ in $M$, if $r m = 0$, then $r = 0$ or $m = 0$. Equivalently, the [[contrapositive]], if $m \neq 0$, then $r m \neq 0$. Some authors require $R$ to be an [[integral domain]], where $Can(R)$ is the monoid of nonzero elements in $R$. 

In [[constructive mathematics]], given a [[ring]] $R$, there are multiple inequivalent ways of defining a torsion-free $R$-module. One could define a torsion-free module as a module such that for all $r$ in $Can(R)$ and $m$ in $M$, if $r m = 0$, then $m = 0$. The first definition is valid in all modules with [[decidable equality]], and could be defined using [[coherent logic]], but is not valid for $\mathbb{R}$-modules. 

If $M$ has a [[tight apartness relations]], then one could define a torsion-free module as a module such that for all $r$ in $Can(R)$ and $m$ in $M$, if $m \# 0$, then $r m \# 0$. This is valid in $\mathbb{R}$-modules, but is no longer capable of being defined in coherent logic. 

A torsion-free $R$-[[associative unital algebra|algebra]] is a [[monoid object]] in torsion-free $R$-modules. 

## Properties

\begin{proposition}
Every [[divisible group|divisible]] torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-module is a [[rational vector space]].
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
Every [[integral domain]] $R$ is a torsion-free $R$-module. 
\end{proposition}

# Paths
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definitions

In [[topology]], a (parametrised, oriented) __path__ in a [[space]] $X$ is a map (a [[morphism]] in an appropriate [[category]] of [[spaces]], such as a [[continuous function]] between [[topological space]]) to $X$ from the [[topological interval]] $\mathbb{I} = [0,1]$.  

A __path from $a$ to $b$__ is a path $f$ such that $f(0) = a$ and $f(1) = b$.  
An __unparametrised path__ is an [[equivalence class]] of paths, such that $f$ and $g$ are equivalent if there is an [[monotone function|increasing]] [[automorphism]] $\phi$ of $\mathbb{I}$ such that $g = f \circ \phi$.  An __unoriented path__ is an equivalence class of paths such that $f$ is equivalent to $(x \mapsto f(1 - x))$.  

If $P$ is a path, then its __reverse path__[^1], denoted $\overline{P}$, is defined to be the composite $P \circ ( t\mapsto 1-t )$. 
The operation $P\mapsto\overline{P}$ is called _path reversal_.

[^1]: Cf. e.g. [[Introduction to Topology -- 2]], or also [Section 2.1](#tomDieck2008); beware that that reference, (0) like many others, uses the term "inverse path", even though the operation of concatenation of paths does not *in and of itself* yield a [[strict category|strict groupoid]], in which $\overline{P}$ would be an inverse, and (1) that it uses $a$ and $b$ for the endpoints of the _interval_, not the endpoints of the paths in the space $X$, and (2) that it uses $P^-$ instead of $\overline{P}$, which however is less suited for notational iterating (compare $\overline{\overline{P}}=P$ with $(P^-)^-=P$), and that (3)  the 2008 edition has a typo: " $w(1-t)$ " in loc. cit., when   *inverse path* gets defined, should be $u(1-t)$.

A __Moore path__ is defined like a path, except for having another domain: replace $[0,1]$ with the interval $[0,n]$ for some [[natural number]] (or, more commonly, any non-negative [[real number]]) $n$.  All of these variations can be combined, of course.  (For unoriented paths, one usually says 'between $a$ and $b$' instead of 'from $a$ to $b$'.  Also, a Moore path from $a$ to $b$ has $f(n) = b$ instead of $f(1) = b$.  Finally, there is not much difference between unparametrised paths and unparametrised Moore paths, since we may interpret $(t \mapsto n t)$ as a reparametrisation $\phi$.)

In [[graph theory]], a __path__ is a [[list]] of edges, each of which ends where the next begins.  Actually, this is a special case of the above, if we use Moore paths and interpret $[0,n]$ as the linear graph with $n + 1$ vertices and $n$ edges; in this way, the other variations become meaningful.  (However, as the only directed graph automorphism of $[0,n]$ is the [[identity morphism|identity]], parametrisation is trivial for directed graphs and equivalent to orientation for undirected graphs.  Note that a non-Moore path is simply an edge, one of the fundamental ingredients of a graph.)


## Concatenation

Given a Moore path $f$ from $a$ to $b$ and a Moore path $g$ from $b$ to $c$, the __concatenation__ of $f$ and $g$ is a Moore path $f ; g$ or $g \circ f$ from $a$ to $c$.  If the domain of $f$ is $[0,m]$ and the domain of $g$ is $[0,n]$, then the domain of $f ; g$ is $[0,m+n]$, and
$$ (f ; g)(x) \coloneqq \left \{ \array { f(x) & \quad x \leq m \\ g(x-m) & \quad x \geq m .} \right . $$
In this way, we get a ([[strict category|strict]]) [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[global element|points]] in $X$ and whose [[morphisms]] are Moore paths in $X$, with concatenation as [[composition]].  This category is called the __[[Moore path category]]__.

Often we are more interested in a [[quotient category]] of the Moore path category.  If we use unparametrised paths (in which case we may use paths with domain $\mathbb{I}$ if we wish), then we get the __unparametrised [[path category]]__.  If $X$ is a [[smooth space]], then we may additionally identify paths related through a [[thin homotopy]] to get the __[[path groupoid]]__.  Finally, if $X$ is a [[continuous space]] and we identify paths related through any (endpoint-preserving) [[homotopy]], then we get the __[[fundamental groupoid]]__ of $X$.

In graph theory, the Moore path category is known as the __[[free category]]__ on the graph.

# Compact operators
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definition

For a [[linear operator]] between [[Banach spaces]], compactness is a natural strengthening of [[bounded operator|continuity]] (boundedness). A linear operator is **compact** if it sends the [[bounded subspace|bounded subsets]] to [[relatively compact subset|relatively compact subsets]]. 

The [[quotient]] of the [[bounded operators]] by the compact operators is called the _[[Calkin algebra]]_.

## Properties

Since every relatively compact subspace (in a Banach space, or indeed in any [[metric space]]) is bounded, every compact operator is bounded. Instead of checking compactness on all bounded subsets it is sufficient to check it for a [[ball]] of one fixed radius: an operator is compact iff it sends the ball of unit radius to a relatively compact set.

See also [[compact self-adjoint operator]].


## Completely continuous operators

In the setup of [[Hilbert spaces]], instead of a compact operator, one sometimes says a completely continuous operator. However, in the full generality of Banach spaces, by a **completely continuous operator** one means slightly less: an operator that maps every [[weak convergence|weakly convergent]] sequence to a [[norm convergence|norm convergent]] sequence. For Hilbert spaces and, more generally, for [[reflexive Banach spaces]], the two notions are equivalent.

## Idea

A _quaternion_ or _Hamilton number_ is a kind of [[number]] similar to the [[complex numbers]] but with three instead of one [[square root]] of $(-1)$ adjoined, satisfying certain relations.

The __quaternions__ form the largest [[associative algebra|associative]] [[normed division algebra]], usually denoted  $\mathbb{H}$ after [[William Rowan Hamilton]] (since $\mathbb{Q}$ is taken for the [[rational numbers]]). 

## Properties

### Normed division algebra structure

The structure of $\mathbb{H}$ as an $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative unital algebra|algebra]] is given by a basis $\{1, i, j, k\}$ of the underlying [[vector space]] of $\mathbb{H}$, equipped with a multiplication table where $1$ is the [[identity element]] and otherwise uniquely specified by the equations 

$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = i j k = -1,$$ 

and extended by $\mathbb{R}$-linearity to all of $\mathbb{H}$. The norm on $\mathbb{H}$ is given by 

$${\|\alpha\|}^2 = \alpha \widebar{\alpha}$$ 

where given an $\mathbb{R}$-[[linear combination]] $\alpha = a 1 + b i + c j + d k$, we define the _conjugate_ $\widebar{\alpha} \coloneqq a 1 - b i - c j - d k$. A simple calculation yields 

$${\|\alpha\|}^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$$ 

whence for $\alpha \neq 0$, the multiplicative [[inverse]] is 

$$\alpha^{-1} = \frac1{{\|\alpha\|}^2} \widebar{\alpha}.$$ 

In this way $\mathbb{H}$ is a normed division algebra. 

### Modules and bimodules

We have canonical left and right [[module]] structures on $\mathbb{H}^n$, but as $\mathbb{H}$ is not commutative, if we want to talk about tensor products of modules, we need to consider [[bimodules]]. This also means that ordinary [[linear algebra]] as is used over a field is not quite the same when dealing with quaternions. For instance, one needs to distinguish between _left_ and _right_ [[eigenvalues]] of [[matrices]] in $M_n(\mathbb{H})$ (using the left and right module structures on $\mathbb{H}^n$ respectively), and only left eigenvalues relate to the [[spectrum]] of the associated linear operator.

Using the conjugation operation one can define an inner product $\langle q,p\rangle := \overline{q} p$ on $\mathbb{H}^n$ so that the corresponding [[orthogonal group of an inner product space|orthogonal group]] is the [[compact symplectic group]].

### Automorphisms

+-- {: .num_prop #AutomorphismsOfQUatrnionsAlgebraIsSO3}
###### Proposition

The [[automorphism group]] of the quaternions, as a real algebra, is [[special orthogonal group|SO(3)]], [[action|acting]] canonically  on their imaginary part (in generalization of how the product of [[complex numbers]] respects the [[complex conjugation]] action)

## Definition 

If $G$ is a [[topological group]], then the **identity component** is the [[connected space|connected component]] of the [[identity element]] $e$ in $G$. 

## Basic results 

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition 
The identity component $G_0$ is a [[closed set|closed]] [[normal subgroup]] of $G$. 
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
It is clearly closed (indeed, any connected component is closed). If $g, h \in G_0$, then $g h$ is in the same connected component as $g$ (since $h$ is in the same connected component as $e$ and left multiplication by $g$ is a [[homeomorphism]]), which in turn is in the same connected component as $e$. Using similar reasoning, if $g$ is in the connected component as $e$, then $e$ is in the same connected component as $g^{-1}$. Hence $G_0$ is a subgroup. 

If $\phi$ is any [[automorphism]] of $G$, then $\phi(G_0) = G_0$. (Indeed, $\phi(G_0)$ is a connected set containing $e$ and therefore $\phi(G_0) \subseteq G_0$. Replacing $\phi$ by its [[inverse]] $\phi^{-1}$, we similarly have $\phi^{-1}(G_0) \subseteq G_0$ and therefore $G_0 \subseteq \phi(G_0)$.) Applying this to [[inner automorphism|inner automorphisms]] $\phi$, we conclude that $G_0$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. 
=-- 

* **Remark:** $G_0$ need not be [[open set|open]] in $G$; for example, for the group of $p$-[[p-adic integer|adic integers]], $G_0$ is the (non-open) [[singleton]] $\{e\}$. However, if $G$ is [[locally connected space|locally connected]], for example if $G$ is a [[Lie group]], then $G_0$ is open (and therefore also [[clopen]]. In this case, $G/G_0$ is discrete (because $G \to G/G_0$ is an open map, implying that the identity and therefore every point in $G/G_0$ is open). 

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition  
The group $G/G_0$, equipped with the [[quotient space|quotient space topology]], is a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Given the fact that $p \colon G \to G/G_0$ is an [[open map|open]] [[surjection]], the [[product]] $p \times p \colon G \times G \to G/G_0 \times G/G_0$ is also an open surjection and therefore a quotient map. It follows easily from the [[universal property]] of quotient maps that the multiplication $G \times G \to G$ therefore descends to a continuous multiplication $G/G_0 \times G/G_0 \to G/G_0$, so that $G/G_0$ is a topological group. 

Because a topological group is a [[uniform space]], the Hausdorff condition follows from a weaker [[separation axiom]] such as $T_1$ (points are closed). It suffices that the identity of $G/G_0$ be closed. Its [[complement]] $C$ is the image under $p$ of the complement of $G_0$ in $G$ (just by examining [[coset]] decompositions), which is open. Since $p$ is an open map, it follows that $C$ is open, so that $\{e\}$ is closed, as desired.

## Idea

The [[tensor product]] of [[linear representations]].

## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[group]] and let

$$
  \rho_i \;\colon\; G \times V_i \longrightarrow V_i
$$

be two [[linear representations]] of $G$ on [[vector spaces]] $V_i$, for $i \in \{1,2\}$. Then the _tensor product of representations_ of these is the linear representation whose underlying vector space is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] $V_1 \otimes_k V_2$ equipped with the $G$-action induced by the [[diagonal action]]

$$
  G \times V_1 \times V_2
     \overset{\Delta_G \times id}{\longrightarrow}
  G \times G \times V_1 \times V_2
     \simeq
   G \times V_1 \times G \times V_1

## Idea

A **double complex** or **bicomplex** is a [[diagram]] of shape $\mathbb{Z}_{\leq} \times \mathbb{Z}_{\leq}$ (in some [[additive category]]):

$$
  \array{
   && \vdots && \vdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^v}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^v}}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n,m} &\stackrel{\partial^h}{\to}& X_{n-1,m}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^v}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^v}}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n,m-1} &\stackrel{\partial^h}{\to}& X_{n-1,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^v}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^v}}
   \\
   && \vdots && \vdots
  }
$$

such that each row and each column is a [[complex]] (the [[differentials]] square to 0: $\partial^v \circ \partial^v = 0$ and $\partial^h \circ \partial^h = 0$) and such that all the squares [[commuting diagram| commute]].

This means that a **double complex** is a [[complex]] in a category of [[complexes]]. 

Accordingly, a **double chain complex** is a [[chain complex]] in a [[category of chain complexes]]. 

$$
  X_{\bullet, \bullet} = 
  \left[
      \cdots \to X_{n,\bullet} \stackrel{\partial^h}{\to} X_{n-1,\bullet} \to \cdots
  \right]
  \,.
$$


In the presence of [[direct sums]], there is a _[[total complex]]_ $(Tot X)_\bullet$ associated to a double complex, which in degree $n$ is the direct sum of all terms of _total degree_ $n$

$$
  (Tot X)_n \coloneqq \oplus_{k+l = n} X_{k,l}.
$$

Often it is such total complexes that are of interest.


The [[differential]] of the total complex is the sum of the horizontal and the vertical differential _made anti-commutative by adjusting signs_. There is a second convention in which one often sees the double complex defined as above from a complex of complexes, but then with the differentials in every second row (or every second column) multiplied by $(-1)$. This is just a different way of sign-bookkeeping, a detailed discussion of this is below. Which convention to use is sometimes influenced by the context, the traditions of the sources in that application of double complexes, and largely a question of taste, that is which one the writer is used to.

Double chain complexes often arise from the application of bifunctors -- [[additive functors]] of two variables -- of [[additive category|additive categories]] $C_1, C_2, C_3$

$$
  F :  C_1 \times C_2 \to C_3
$$

to complexes in their two arguments. Combining this with the formation of [[total complexes]] then yields bifunctors from  categories of complexes to categories of complexes. 

$$
 \tilde F : Ch(C_1) \times Ch(C_2) \to Ch(C_3)
 \,.
$$

The most important examples of this are induced by the [[hom-functor]] and the [[tensor product]] functor together with their [[derived functors]], [[Ext]] and [[Tor]].

Notice that under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] and with sufficient [[resolutions]], such $\tilde F$ can be understood as the internal hom or tensor products, etc., between [[infinity-groupoid|higher groupoids]].


Although we suggest (and prefer) the 'complex of complexes' definition, as above, rather than the equivalent  _anticommutiing diagram_ one, we give both and will discuss how to go between them in some detail.

## Definition

### With commuting differentials


A double complex, $X$, is a commutative diagram in an additive category in which  the objects are bi-indexed by the integers, 

$$\{ X_{p,q} \mid p,q\in \mathbb{Z} \}$$

and with two classes of '[[differentials]]' or 'boundary morphisms':

* $d_X^v: X_{p,q}\to X_{p,q-1}$ called the 'vertical boundary morphisms' or 'vertical differentials', with $d_X^v d_X^v = 0$;

and

* $d_X^h: X_{p,q}\to X_{p-1,q}$ called the 'horizontal boundary morphisms' or 'horizontal differentials', with  $d_X^h d_X^h = 0$;

such that all [[commuting diagram|squares commute]]

* $d_X^h \circ d_X^v = d_X^v \circ d_X^h$. 

(To state the obvious, this means $d_X^h d_X^v - d_X^v d_X^h=0$, in contrast to the formula in the second version [below](#AntiCommutingDifferentials).)

This gives a commutative diagram:

$$
  \array{
   && \vdots && \vdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n,m} &\stackrel{d_X^h}{\to}& X_{n,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n-1,m} &\stackrel{d_X^h}{\to}& X_{n-1,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
   && \vdots && \vdots
  }
$$

### With anti-commuting differentials
 {#AntiCommutingDifferentials}


A double complex, $X$, is an anticommutative diagram in an additive category in which the objects are bi-indexed by the integers, 

$$\{ X_{p,q} \mid p,q\in \mathbb{Z} \}$$

and with two classes of 'differentials' or 'boundary morphisms':

* $d_X^v: X_{p,q}\to X_{p,q-1}$ called the 'vertical boundary morphisms' or 'vertical differentials', with $d_X^v d_X^v = 0$;

and

* $\bar{d}_X^h: X_{p,q}\to X_{p-1,q}$ called the 'horizontal boundary morphisms' or 'horizontal differentials', with  $\bar{d}_X^h \bar{d}_X^h = 0$;

in addition $\bar{d}_X^h d_X^v + d_X^v \bar{d}_X^h = 0$.

This gives an anticommutative diagram:
$$
  \array{
   && \vdots && \vdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n,m} &\stackrel{\bar{d}_X^h}{\to}& X_{n,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} & \swArr_{-1} & \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n-1,m} &\stackrel{\bar{d}_X^h}{\to}& X_{n-1,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
   && \vdots && \vdots
  }
$$


### Equivalence of the two definitions
 {#EquivalenceOfTheTwoDefinitions}

Which definition is 'better'? 'Commuting squares', i.e., the first version, is convenient if you want to define a double complex as a chain complex in the category of chain complexes. On the other hand, 'anticommuting squares' and version 2 is sometimes convenient for defining the total complex (for computing total homology). Does it matter which you use? The following says they are just two views of the same situation.



One makes a double complex $X$ with commutative squares into a double complex with anticommutative squares by using the same vertical differential $d^v$ but taking $\bar{d}^h : X_{p,q} \to X_{p,q-1}$ to be $(-1)^p d^h$. The same trick can, of course, be used to make a double complex with anticommutative squares into a double complex with commutative squares.

## Properties

### Total complex of a double complex

The **[[total complex]]** of a double complex (under the convention that squares commute) is

$$
  tot_{\oplus}^k = \bigoplus_{m+n=k} X_{n,m}
$$

$$
  d^k_{tot_\oplus}|_{X_{n,m}} = 
  d^v_X + (-1)^\bullet d_X^h 
$$

Similarly, one can define the product total complex as

$$
  tot_{\prod}^k = \prod_{m+n=k} X_{n,m}
$$
$$
  d^k_{tot_\prod}|_{X_{n,m}} = 
  d^v_X + (-1)^\bullet d_X^h 
$$

Note that these two coincide when the set of non-zero objects $X_{n,m}$ such that $n + m = k$ is finite, for example, when $X$ is a first quadrant double complex.

### Fundamental lemmas

There is series of basic [[lemmas]] in [[homological algebra]] 
which determine the horizontal/vertical [[homology groups]] of a double complex in some row or column from exactness information in other columns.
The most fundamental of these is maybe the 

* [[salamander lemma]]

from which a series of others follow:

* [[snake lemma]] (see also [[connecting homomorphism]] and [[long exact sequence in homology]])

* [[3x3 lemma]]

* [[5-lemma]]

* [[horseshoe lemma]] .

## Relation to homotopy colimits

The total complex of the double complex induced by a [[chain map]]
is a model for the [[mapping cone]] of that map, see at _[mapping cone -- via double complexes](mapping+cone#ConeViaDoubleComplex) for more.

## Idea

The _fiber_ of a [[morphism]] or [[bundle]] $f : E \to B$ over a [[point]] of $B$ is the collection of [[generalized element|elements]] of $E$ that are mapped by $f$ to this point.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Lemma

For $f : A \to B$ a [[morphism]] in a [[category]] and $B$ equipped with the [[structure]] of a [[pointed object]] $pt : * \to B$, the **fiber** of $f$ is the [[fiber product]] of $f$ with $pt$, hence the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    A \times_B * &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow_pt
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

## Examples

### Bundles

Given a [[bundle]] $p: E \to B$ and a [[global element]] $x: 1 \to B$, the __fibre__ or __fiber__ $E_x$ of $(E,p)$ over $x$ is the [[pullback]]
$$ \array {
   E_x        & \to             & E \\
   \downarrow &                 & \downarrow_p \\
   1          & \stackrel{x}\to & B
} $$
if it exists.

In a [[fiber bundle]], all fibres are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to some standard fibre $F$ in a coherent way.

### Kernels

In an [[additive category]] fibers over the [[zero object]] are called _[[kernels]]_.

### Fibers of a sheaf of modules

The fiber of a sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ of $\mathcal{O}$-modules over a [[locally ringed space]] $(X,\mathcal{O})$ at a point $x \in X$ is defined as the vector space $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \mathcal{E}_x \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_x} k(x)$ over the [[residue field]] $k(x)$. If $\mathcal{E}$ is [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent]], the associated vector bundle of the fiber is the pullback of the associated vector bundle of $\mathcal{E}$:
$$ \array {
   V(\mathcal{E}(x)) = \mathrm{Spec} \mathrm{Sym} \mathcal{E}(x)
     & \to
     & \underline{Spec}_X \mathrm{Sym} \mathcal{E} = V(\mathcal{E}) \\
   \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
   \mathrm{Spec} k(x) & \to & X
} $$

An element of a [[ring]] (or [[rig]]) or [[lattice]] (or [[proset]]) is called __prime__ if the [[ideal]] that it generates is a [[prime ideal]] (thus a [[principal ideal|principal]] prime ideal).

Note that by this definition [[zero]] is a prime element of the [[rig]] of [[natural numbers]], although it is not a [[prime number]].  Prime numbers as such correspond more closely to [[maximal ideals]] or [[irreducible ideals]] than to prime ideals.

Classically (using [[excluded middle]]), a prime element of a [[frame]] corresponds precisely to a [[point of a locale|point]] of the corresponding [[locale]].  For a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] treatment, however, one must use the [[completely prime filters]] of the frame instead.

## Idea

[[Georg Cantor]] used to define the [[continuum]] as a **perfect space** that is [[connected space|connected]] as well.  Hence, the property of 'being perfect', as the name indicates as well, can be viewed as forming part of the concept of a 'prototypical' [[topological space]].


## Definitions

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **perfect** if it has no isolated points, i.e., if every point $x$ belongs to the topological [[closure operator|closure]] of its [[complement]] $X \setminus \{x\}$.  Sometimes one requires a perfect space to be [[inhabited space|inhabited]] (nonempty), although it is better to allow the [[empty space]].

In a topological space $X$, a [[subset]] is said to be __perfect__ if it is [[closed set|closed]] in $X$ and perfect in its [[subspace topology]].  In other words, a set $A$ is perfect if and only if it equals its set $A'$ of [[accumulation points]].  Because of the closure requirement, being a perfect set/subset/subspace depends on the ambient space and is stronger than being a perfect space.  (But $X$ is a perfect subset of itself iff $X$ is a perfect space.)

In a topological space $X$, a subset $A$ has the __perfect-set property__ if it is either [[countable set|countable]] (possibly [[finite set|finite]] or even [[empty subset|empty]]) or has an inhabited perfect subset.  Of course, any perfect set has the perfect-set property.

If for each set $B$, ($B$ has a point apart from each point in $A$ if $B$ is inhabited and $B$ is perfect) and ($B$ is empty if $B$ is contained in $A$ and $B$ is perfect) and ($B$ has an isolated point if $B$ is contained in $A$ and inhabited), then $A$ is countable.


## Examples

* The [[empty space]] is perfect (unless it is excluded by fiat).

* The [[Cantor space]] $2^\mathbb{N}$ is perfect, in fact, it is the only [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]], [[compact space|compact]], [[metrizable space|metrizable]] space that is perfect.

* The [[real line]] is perfect.

* Every [[Polish space]] (including the previous two examples) is perfect.  Furthermore, any [[closed subset]] of a Polish space has the perfect-set property.

*  Using the [[axiom of choice]], one may prove the existence of subsets of the real line that do not have the perfect-set property.  In contrast, one of the axioms of [[dream mathematics]] is that every subset of the real line does have this property.  This makes the [[continuum hypothesis]] a theorem of dream mathematics.


## Properties

* Every topological space $X$ is the disjoint union of a [[scattered space|scattered subset]] and a perfect subset.

* Every perfect subset of a [[Polish space]] $X$ (including $X$ itself) has the [[cardinality of the continuum]] ($\beth_1$).  (This is why the continuum hypothesis follows from the non-classical axiom that every subset of the real line has the perfect-set property.)

* Every [[closed subset]] of a [[Polish space]] is a unique [[disjoint union]] of a countable set and a (possibly empty) perfect set.

### Principal minors of matrices with commutative entries

Given a matrix $A = (a^i_j)_{i,j = 1,\ldots n}$ with entries in a commutative ring $R$, the principal minors are the [[minor]]s of the upper left corner square matrices, i.e.

$$
det (a^i_j)_{i,j = 1,\ldots k}
$$

where $k = 1,\ldots, n$ (i.e there are $n$ principal minors). 

Sometimes it is convenient to consider the principal minors of the matrix in the oppositely ordered basis, i.e. the minors of the lower right corner

$$
det (a^i_j)_{i,j = n-k+1,\ldots n}
$$

Of course, as it is true for the expression minor in general, sometimes it denotes the determinant of the submatrix and for some authors it is the submatrix itself called that way.

The principal minors appear as the denominators in the [[Gauss decomposition]] of matrices, and consequently in the description of relations between matrix elements in a linear group $GL(n)$ (or $SL(n)$) and canonical coordinates on the big Bruhat cell on its [[flag variety]]. 

### Principal quasiminors

Quasideterminant of a matrix $|A|_{ij}$ with entries in a noncommutative [[ring]], generalizes (up to sign), from the commutative case, the ratio of $n\times n$-determinant and the determinant of the $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ submatrix obtained by crossing out the $i$-th row and $j$-th column. In particular the determinant of $A$ in the commutative case can be obtained as a product of all its principal quasiminors, provided the latter are defined (quasideterminants are rational expressions not necesarilly always defined). 

Principal quasiminors play role in the study of noncommutative flag varieties. 

### Quantum group case

Similar role play quantum principal minors in the study of quantum flag variety, cf. sec, 14 in 

* [[Zoran Škoda]], _Localizations for construction of quantum coset spaces_, in "Noncommutative geometry and Quantum groups", W.Pusz, P.M. Hajac, eds. Banach Center Publications vol.61, pp. 265&#8211;298, Warszawa 2003, [math.QA/0301090](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0301090)

Since both $E_1$ and $E_2$ are simply connected, the assumption of the lifting theorem for covering spaces is satisfied ([this prop.](covering+space#TheTheoremLifting)). This says that there are horizontal continuous function making the following diagrams commute:

$$
  \array{
    E_1 && \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} && E_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_2}}
    \\
    && X
  }
  \phantom{AAAAAA}
  \array{
    E_2 && \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} && E_1
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p_2}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_1}}
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

$$
  \array{
    E_i && \overset{id}{\longrightarrow} && E_i
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p_i}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_i}}
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

and that these are _unique_ once we specify the image of a single point, which we may freely do (in the given fiber).

So if we pick any point $x \in X$ and $\hat x_1 \in E_1$ with $p(\hat x) = x$ and $\hat x_2 \in E_2$ with $p(\hat x_2) = x$ and specify that $f(\hat x_1) = \hat x_2$ and $g(\hat x_2) = \hat x_1$ then uniqueness applied to the composites implies $f \circ g = id_{E_{2}}$ and $g \circ f = id_{E_1}$.

**(universal covering space)**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is

1. [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]],

1. [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path connected]].

Then a [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]] and [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] [[covering space]], is called [[generalized the|the]] _universal covering space_ of $X$. This is well-defined, if it exists, up to [[isomorphism]], by prop. \ref{SimplyConnectedCoveringUniqueness}.

###### Proposition
**([[universal covering space]] reconstructed from [[free action|free]] and [[transitive action|transitive]] [[fundamental group]] [[representation]])**

Let $X$ be a topological space which is _[[well-connected space|well-connected]]_ in that it is

* [[path-connected space|path-connected]], 

* [[locally path-connected space|locally path-connected]] 

* and [[semi-locally simply-connected space|semi-locally simply-connected]] 

Then a universal covering space of $X$ (def. \ref{CoveringUniversal}) exists.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [this prop.](covering+space#CoveringConnectivityViaMonodromy) the covering space is connected and simply connected precisely if its [[monodromy]] representation is free and transitive. By the [[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]] every [[permutation representation]] of the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ arises as the monodromy of some covering space. Hence it remains to see that a free and transitive representation of $\Pi_1(X)$ exists. Let $x \in X$ be any point, then $Hom_{\Pi_1(X)}(x,-)$ is such a representation. 

=--


This is a  functorial construction of a universal covering spaces

$$
  Top_*^{wc} \longrightarrow Cov_*
$$

where $Top_*^{wc}$ denotes the [[full subcategory]] of [[pointed topological spaces]] $Top_*$ on the well-connected spaces and $Cov$ is the subcategory of $Top_*^2$ of pointed maps of spaces with objects the covering space maps.

Specifically, if $X$ is a space with basepoint $x_0$, we define $X^{(1)}$ to be the space whose points are homotopy classes of paths in $X$ starting at $x_0$, with the projection $X^{(1)}\to X$ projecting to the endpoint of a path.  We can equip this set $X^{(1)}\to X$ with a topology coming from $X$ so that it becomes a universal covering space as above.  As described at [[covering space]], under the correspondence between covering spaces and $\Pi_1(X)$-actions, the space $X^{(1)}$ corresponds to the "regular representation" of $\Pi_1(X)$.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark
This [[regular representation]] can be seen to arise by taking a [[category of elements]] in the same way that the regular representation of a group is gotten by taking its action on itself: we can see that the  _universal covering groupoid_ $\Pi(X)^{(1)}$ in the [[slice category]] $\mathbf{Grpd}/\Pi(X)$ (see the universal covering $\infty$-groupoid below) is just the category of elements of the action of $\Pi(X)$ on itself, and can be topologized in a natural way by lifting the topology on $X$ along the canonical projection $\Pi(X)^{(1)} \to \Pi(X)$; decategorifying this yields $X^{(1)}$.

### In cohesive homotopy theory
 {#InCohesiveHomotopyTheory}

We describe now how the universal cover construction may be understood from the [[nPOV]], using a [[fragment]] of [[cohesive homotopy theory]].

 The basic idea is that the universal cover of a space $X$ is the [[homotopy fiber]] of the canonical morphism

$$
  X \longrightarrow \Pi_1(X)
$$ 

from $X$ to its [[fundamental groupoid]], which exists if both objects are regarded as "[[topological ∞-groupoids]]".  We may think of this as a precise way of the intuitive idea of "[[forcing]] $\Pi_1(X)$ to become trivial in a universal way".  


+-- {: .num_example #ExamplesOfCohesiveToposesOfTopologicalGroupoids}
###### Example
**(cohesive higher toposes of topological groupoids)**

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be some [[∞-cohesive site]] of [[spaces]] and consider 

$$
  \mathbf{H} \coloneqq Sh_\infty(\mathcal{S})
$$ 

the corresponding [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] over this site. This is the [[(∞,1)-category]] of "[[topological ∞-groupoids]]" modeled on $\mathcal{S}$.

A canonical choice relating to the traditional discussion would be $\mathcal{S} = Top^\kappa_{lcont}$ a [[small category|small]] [[full subcategory]] of [[Top]] on [[locally contractible topological spaces]], in which case the objects of $\mathbf{H}$ might be called "[[locally contractible topological ∞-groupoids]]".

A more restrictive choice would be $\mathcal{S} = $ [[CartSp]], in which case the objects of $\mathbf{H}$ might be called [[Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids]].

In fact for the discussion of just universal [[covering spaces]] as opposed to the higher stages in the [[Whitehead tower]] it would be sufficient and more natural to take $\mathcal{S}$ the full subcategory of [[locally simply connected topological spaces]] and consider just the [[(2,1)-category]] $\mathbf{H}$ of [[stacks]] over this site.  

=--

But the following discussion is completely formal and applies globally to all such realizations. Namely all we need is that 

+-- {: .num_defn #AssumptionOnH}
###### Assumption

Assume that

1. $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesive (n,1)-topos]]

   $$
     \mathbf{H}
       \array{
         \overset{\Pi}{\longrightarrow}
         \\
         \overset{\Delta}{\longleftarrow}
         \\
         \overset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}
         \\
         \overset{\nabla}{\longleftarrow}
       }
     \mathbf{B}
   $$

   over the given [[base (∞,1)-topos|base (n,1)-topos]] of [[n-groupoids]].

1. such that its [[shape modality]] preserves [[homotopy fiber products]] over [[discrete objects]] (objects in the essential image of $\Delta$). 

We write

$$
  &#643; \coloneqq \Delta \Pi
$$

for the induced [[shape modality]] and 

$$
  X \overset{\eta_X}{\longrightarrow} &#643; X
$$

for its [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] morphism ona given object $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Assumption \ref{AssumptionOnH} is satisfied for the case of $(\infty,1)$-toposes over an [[∞-cohesive site]] and for $(n,1)$-toposes by an $n$-cohesive site as in example \ref{ExamplesOfCohesiveToposesOfTopologicalGroupoids}: by [this prop.](cohesive+infinity-topos#PiPreservesPullbacksOverDiscretes).

=--

Now consider $X \in \mathbf{H}$ any object, for instance a [[topological space]] regarded as a [[0-truncated object|0-truncated]] [[topological infinity-groupoid]].
 
Assume, just for ease of discussion, that $X$ is _geometrically connected_ in that the [[0-truncated object|0-truncation]] of its [[shape]] is [[contractible]]:

$$
  \tau_0(&#643; X) \simeq \ast
  \,.
$$


Using the [[axiom of choice]] in the base topos $\mathbf{H}$ we choose a point 

$$
  \ast \to \tau_1(&#643; X)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The _universal cover_ of $X$ is the [[homotopy pullback]] in 


$$
  \array{
    \hat X &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\underset{L_{\tau_1} \circ \eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& \tau_1(&#643; X)
  }
  \,.
$$


=--

The [[universal property]] of $\hat X$ is immediate from the abstract setup:

1. $\hat X$ is simply connected, in that $\tau_1 &#643; \hat X \simeq \ast$

   This is because $&#643; X$ is discrete by construction, and hence so is $\tau_1(&#643; X)$. So by assumption \ref{AssumptionOnH} applying $&#643;$ to the above square yields another homotopy pullback of the form

   $$
     \array{
       &#643; \hat X &\longrightarrow& \ast
       \\
       \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
       \\
       &#643; X &\underset{&#643; \eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& \tau_1(&#643; X)
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Now the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] (in $\mathbf{B}$) applied to this [[homotopy fiber sequence]] is of the form


   $$
     0 \to \pi_1(&#643; \hat X) \longrightarrow \pi_1(&#643; X) \overset{=}{\longrightarrow} \pi_1(\tau_1 &#643; X) \to \cdots
   $$

   which implies that $\pi_1( &#643; \hat X )$ and hence $\tau_1 &#643; \hat X$ is indeed trivial.

1. Let $E \longrightarrow X$ be any other object of $\mathbf{H}_{/X}$ such that $\tau_1(&#643; E) \simeq \ast$, then there is a morphism

   $$
     \array{
       E && \longrightarrow && \hat X
       \\
       & \searrow && \swarrow
       \\
       && X
     }
   $$

   This is because the naturality of the shape unit and of the truncation unit gives a homotopy commuting square of the form

   $$
     \array{
       E &\overset{\eta_E}{\longrightarrow}& &#643; E &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& \tau_1(&#643; E ) \simeq \ast
       \\
       \downarrow && && \downarrow
       \\
       X &\underset{\eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& &#643; X &\longrightarrow& \tau_1 &#643; X
     }
   $$

   and thus a [[cone]] over the diagram which defines $\hat X$ via its [[universal property]].

This shows that $\hat X$ is the universal cover on abstract grounds.

We may also check explicitly that $\hat X$ is given as the space of homotopy classes of [[paths]] in $X$ from the given basepoint. To that end we use that, at least over the site [[CartSp]], the [[shape modality|shape]] of $X$ is represented by the topological [[path ∞-groupoid]]. See at _[[shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid]]_.

###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a suitably well behaved pointed space. The universal cover $X^{(1)}$ of $X$ is (equivalent to) the [[homotopy fiber]] of $X \to \Pi(X)$ in the [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathbf{H} = Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Top_{cg})$ of [[topological ∞-groupoid]]s.

In other words, the [[principal ∞-bundle]] classified by the [[cocycle]] $X \to \Pi_1(X)$ is the universal cover $X^{(1)}$: we have a [[homotopy pullback]] square

$$
  \array{
    X^{(1)} &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& \Pi(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .query}

[[Urs Schreiber]]: may need polishing.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We place ourselves in the context of [[topological ∞-groupoid]]s and regard both the space $X$ as well as its [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$ and its truncation to the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ as objects in there.

The canonical morphism $X \to \Pi(X)$ hence $X \to \Pi_1(X)$ given by the inclusion of constant paths may be regarded as a [[cocycle]] for a $\Pi(X)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]], respectively for a $\Pi_1(X)$-principal bundle.

Let $\pi_0(X)$ be the set of connected components of $X$, regarded as a topological $\infty$-groupoid, and choose any [[section]]  $\pi_0(X) \to \Pi(X)$ of the projection $\Pi(X) \to \pi_0(X)$.

Then the $\Pi(X)$-principal $\infty$-bundle classified by the [[cocycle]] $X \to \Pi(X)$ is its [[homotopy fiber]], i.e. the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    UCov(X) &\to& \pi_0(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& \Pi(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

We think of this topological $\infty$-groupoid $UCov(X)$ as the **universal covering $\infty$-groupoid** of $X$. To break this down, we check that its [[decategorification]] gives the ordinary universal covering space: 

for this we compute the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    UCov_1(X) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
    \\
    X &\to& \Pi_1(X)
  }
  \,,
$$

where we assume $X$ to be connected with chosen baspoint $x$ just to shorten the exposition a little. By the laws of [[homotopy pullback]]s in general and [[homotopy fiber]]s in particular, we may compute this as the ordinary [[pullback]] of a weakly equivalent diagram, where the point $*$ is resolved to the [[generalized universal bundle|universal]] $\Pi_1(X)$-principal bundle

$$
  \mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X) = T_x \Pi_1(X)
  \,.
$$

> (More in detail, what we do behind the scenes is this: we regard the diagram as a diagram in the _global_ [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on [[Top]]. In there all our topological groupoids are fibrant, hence all we have to ensure is that one of the morphisms of the diagram becomes a fibration, which is what the passage to $\mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X)$ achieves. Then the ordinary pullback in the category of simplicial presheaves is the homotopy pullback in $\infty$-prestacks. Then by left exactness of $\infty$-stackification, the image of that in $\infty$-stacks is still a homotopy pullback. )

The topological groupoid $\mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X)$ has as objects homotopy classes rel endpoints of paths in $X$  starting at $x$ and as morphisms $\kappa : \gamma \to \gamma'$ it has commuting triangles

$$
  \array{
    && x
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\gamma}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma'}}
    \\
    y &&\stackrel{\kappa}{\to}&& y'
  }
$$

in $\Pi_1(X)$. The topology on this can be deduced from thinking of this as the [[pullback]]


$$
  \array{
   \mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X) &\to& {*}
   \\
   \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
   \\
   \Pi_1(X)^I &\stackrel{d_0}{\to}& \Pi_1(X)
  }
$$

in simplicial presheaves on [[Top]]. Unwinding what this means we find that the open sets in $Mor(\mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X))$ are those where the endpoint evaluation produces an open set in $X$.

Now it is immediate to read off the homotopy pullback as the ordinary pullback

$$
  \array{
    UCov_1(X) &\to& \mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& \Pi_1(X)
    \,.
  }
$$

Since $X$ is categorically discrete, this simply produces the space of objects of $\mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X)$ over the points of $X$, which is just the space of all paths in $X$ starting at $x$ with the projection $UCov_1(X) \to X$ being endpoint evaluation. 

This indeed is then the usual construction of the universal covering space in terms of paths, as described for instance in 

* _[Covering spaces, Building a universal cover](http://www.mathreference.com/at-cov,build.html)_ , [Math Reference Project](http://www.mathreference.com/) 

=--


### In the petit $\infty$-toposes over the space

On the other hand, we can view a space $X$ as the little $(\infty,1)$-topos $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves on $X$.  If $X$ is locally connected and locally simply connected in the "coverings" sense, then $Sh(X)$ is locally 1-connected.

In fact, for the construction of the universal cover we require only the (2,1)-topos $Sh_{(2,1)}(X)$ of sheaves (stacks) of [[groupoids]] on $X$, so we will work in that context because it is simpler.  The construction can be adapted, however, to produce a "universal cover" of any locally 1-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos.

Let $E$ be any (2,1)-topos which is locally 1-connected.  This means that in the unique [[global sections]] [[geometric morphism]] $(E^*,E_*)\colon E\to Gpd$, the functor $E^*$ has a left adjoint $E_!\colon E \to Gpd$, which is automatically $Gpd$-[[indexed functor|indexed]].  The [[fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|fundamental groupoid]] of $E$ is defined to be $\Pi_1(E)\coloneqq E_!(*)$, where $*$ is the [[terminal object]] of $E$.

As discussed [[fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|here]] in the $(\infty,1)$-case, the construction of $\Pi_1(E)$ is a left adjoint to the inclusion of groupoids into locally 1-connected (2,1)-toposes (which sends $G\mapsto Gpd/G \simeq Gpd^G$).  Thus we have a geometric morphism $E\to \Pi_1(E)$ (where we regard $\Pi_1(E)$ as the (2,1)-topos $Gpd^{\Pi_1(E)}$).

Suppose, for simplicity, that $E$ is connected.  Then $\Pi_1(E)$ is also connected, and so we have an essentially unique functor $*\to \Pi_1(E)$.  We define the **universal cover** of $E$ to be the pullback (2,1)-topos:
$$\array{ E^{(1)} & \to & E \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ * & \to & \Pi_1(E)}$$
(where of course $*$ denotes the terminal (2,1)-topos $Gpd$).

Now observe that $*\to \Pi_1(E)$ is a [[local homeomorphism of toposes]], since we have $Gpd \simeq Gpd/\Pi_1(E)/(*\to \Pi_1(E))$.  Since local homeomorphisms of toposes are stable under pullback, $E^{(1)}\to E$ is also a local homeomorphism, i.e. there exists an object $\widetilde{E}\in E$ and an equivalence $E^{(1)} \simeq E/\widetilde{E}$ over $E$.  Moreover, it is not hard to see that $\widetilde{E}$ can be identified with the pullback
$$\array{ \widetilde{E} & \to & * \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\eta} \\ * & \to & E^*(\Pi_1(E)) \mathrlap{= E^*(E_!(*))}}$$
in $E$.  Note that the bottom map $*\to E^*(E_!(*))$ is $E^*$ applied to the unique map $*\to E_!(*)$, while the right-hand map is the unit of the adjunction $E_!\dashv E^*$.

In order to see that this is a sensible definition, we first observe that $E^{(1)}$ is itself locally 1-connected (since it is etale over $E$).  Moreover, it is actually 1-connected, which is equivalent to saying that $E_!(\widetilde{E}) = *$.  This is because the "Frobenius reciprocity" condition for the adjunction $E_!\dashv E^*$ (which is equivalent to saying that $E_!$ is $Gpd$-indexed) applied to the defining pullback of $\widetilde{E}$ implies that we also have a pullback
$$\array{ E_!(\widetilde{E}) & \to & E_!(*) \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{id} \\ * & \to & E_!(*)}$$
which clearly implies that $E_!(\widetilde{E}) = *$.

Thus, $E^{(1)}$ is a connected and simply connected space with a local homeomorphism to $E$, but is it a covering space?  In other words, is it locally trivial?  Since we have supposed that $E$ is locally 1-connected, as a (2,1)-category it can be generated by 1-connected objects, i.e. objects $U$ such that $E_!(U)\simeq *$.  In particular, we have a 1-connected object $U$ and a [[regular 1-epic]] $U\to *$.

We claim that if $U$ is any 1-connected object of $E$, then $\widetilde{E}$ is trivialized (or split) over $U$, in that $U\times \widetilde{E}$ is equivalent, over $U$, to $U\times E^*S$ for some $S\in Gpd$.  For pulling back the defining pullback to $U$, we obtain
$$\array{ U\times \widetilde{E} & \to & U \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{U\times \eta} \\ U & \to & U\times E^*(\Pi_1(E)).}$$
But $U\times E^*(\Pi_1(E)) \cong (E/U)^* (\Pi_1(E))$, so to give a map $U \to (E/U)^* (\Pi_1(E))$ over $U$ is the same as to give a map $(E/U)_!(*) \to \Pi_1(E)$ in $Gpd$.  But $(E/U)_!(*)\simeq *$, since $U$ is 1-connected, and $\Pi_1(E)$ is connected, so there is only one such morphism.  Therefore, the two maps $U\to U\times E^*(\Pi_1(E))$ in the pullback above are in fact the same, and in particular both are the pullback to $E/U$ of the map $*\to \Pi_1(E)$.  Thus, $U\times \widetilde{E}$ is equivalent to $(E/U)^*(S) \cong U\times E^*(S)$, where $S= \Omega(\Pi_1(E))$ is the loop object of $\Pi_1(E)$, i.e. what we might call the fundamental *group* of the connected (2,1)-topos $E$.

Therefore, since $\widetilde{E}$ is trivialized over any 1-connected object, and $E$ is generated by 1-connected objects, $\widetilde{E}$ is locally trivial.  Moreover, since $*$ is a [[discrete object]] of $E$, so is $\widetilde{E}$.  Thus, if we specialize all this to the case $E=Sh_{(2,1)}(X)$ of (2,1)-sheaves on a topological space, then we conclude that $\widetilde{E}$ is an honest 1-sheaf on $X$ which, when regarded as a local homeomorphism over $X$, is locally trivial (hence a covering space), connected, and 1-connected---i.e. a universal cover of $X$.

###### Example
**([[real line]] is universal covering of [[circle]])**

Let 

1. $\mathbb{R}^1$ be the [[real line]] with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]];

1. $S^1 \coloneqq \left\{ x\in \mathbb{R}^2 \;\vert\; {\Vert x\Vert} = 1 \right\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the [[circle]] with its [[subspace topology]] induced from the [[Euclidean plane]].

Consider the [[continuous function]]

$$
  \array{
     \mathbb{R}^1
       &\overset{p}{\longrightarrow}& 
     S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2
     \\
     t &\mapsto& (\cos(2\pi t), \sin(2\pi t)) 
  }  
  \,.
$$

This exhibits the universal covering space (def. \ref{CoveringUniversal}) of the circle.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Let $p \in S^1$ be any point. It is clear that we have a [[homeomorphism]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \setminus p
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    (0, 1)  
  }
  \,.
$$

and hence a [[homeomorphism]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \times Disc(\mathbb{Z}) &\simeq& (0,1) \times Disc(\mathbb{Z})
    &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    p^{-1}(S^1 \setminus \{p\}) 
    \\
    && (t,n) &\mapsto& (cos(2\pi n t), \sin(2\pi n t))
  }
  \,.
$$

Now for $p_1 \neq p_2$ two distinct point in $S^1$, their [[complements]] constitute an [[open cover]]

$$
  \left\{ S^1 \setminus p_i \subset S^1  \right\}_{i \in \{1,2\}}
$$

and so this exhibits $p \colon \mathbb{R}^1 \to S^1$ as being covering spaces.

Now 

1. $S^1$ is [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]] and [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path connected]] ([this example](LocallyPathConnectedCircle));

1. $\mathbb{R}^1$ is [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] ([this example](fundamental+group#EuclideanSpaceFundamentalGroup)).

Therefore $p$ exhibits $\mathbb{R}^1$ as a universal covering space of $S^1$, by def. \ref{CoveringUniversal}.

# Absolutely continuous measures
* table of contents

## Idea

A [[measure]] $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\nu$ if we can think of $\mu$ as a weighted variation on $\nu$.


## Definition

Fix a [[measurable space]] $X$ and let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be two [[measures]] on $X$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The measure $\mu$ is __absolutely continuous__ with respect to $\nu$ if every $\nu$-[[full set]] is also $\mu$-full.
=--

Because [[null sets]] are more familiar than [[full sets]], we may equivalently express things as follows (but this is not correct in [[constructive mathematics]]):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (classical)

The measure $\mu$ is __absolutely continuous__ with respect to $\nu$ if every $\nu$-[[null set]] is also $\mu$-null.
=--

If $\mu$ and $\nu$ are [[positive measures]], then we may also express this as follows:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (positive, classical)

The positive measure $\mu$ is __absolutely continuous__ with respect to $\nu$ if, for every [[measurable set]] $A$, $\mu(A) = 0$ if $\nu(A) = 0$.
=--

Since the [[absolute value]] of a measure is a positive measure, we can also express the general definition as follows:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (classical)

The measure $\mu$ is __absolutely continuous__ with respect to $\nu$ if, for every [[measurable set]] $A$, ${|\mu|}(A) = 0$ if ${|\nu|}(A) = 0$.
=--


## Generalisation

Since only the [[full sets]] (or, classically, the [[null sets]]) matter, we do not need to have the full structure of a [[measure]].  Sometimes we equip a [[measurable space]] with a $\delta$-[[delta-filter|filter]] $\mathcal{F}$ of full sets (or a $\sigma$-[[sigma-ideal|ideal]] $\mathcal{N}$ of null sets) without specifying a measure that produces these.  (For example, a [[smooth manifold]] is so equipped, effectively the full/null sets under [[Lebesgue measure]], even though there is no canonical such measure, since these sets are the same regardless of [[coordinate chart]].)  Then we say:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The measure $\mu$ is __absolutely continuous__ with respect to $\mathcal{F}$ (or $\mathcal{N}$) if every element of $\mathcal{F}$ is $\mu$-[[full set|full]] (or every element of $\mathcal{N}$ is $\mu$-[[null set|null]]).
=--

In fact, only the full/null sets of $\mu$ matter either, but until somebody has use for the notion of one $\delta$-filter (or $\sigma$-ideal) being absolutely continuous with respect to another, I will refrain from writing it down.  (See [[centipede mathematics]].)


## Defaults

If one calls a measure on the [[real line]] 'absolutely continuous', this means with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]].

This generalises to any [[cartesian space]] (with Lebesgue measure) or indeed to any [[smooth manifold]] of [[finite dimension]] (where there is no canonical Lebesgue measure but a family of local ones and so still a notion of Lebesgue-full and Lebesgue-null sets).

Or, this generalises to any [[compact group]] (with [[Haar measure]]) or indeed to any [[locally compact group]] (where there is no canonical Haar measure but a proportional family of them and so still a canonical notion of Haar-full and Haar-null sets).


## Properties

Let $\nu$ be a measure, and let $f \in L^1(\nu)$ be an [[absolutely integrable function]] with respect to $\nu$; then [[integration]] defines a measure $f \nu$:
$$ (f \nu)(E) = \int_E f \nu = \int_E f(x) \nu(\mathrm{d}x) .$$
This measure $f \nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\nu$.  Conversely, given any absolutely continuous measure $\mu$, there is (at most) a unique (up to [[almost equality]]) absolutely integrable function $f$ such that $\mu = f \nu$; and this function must exist if $\mu$ and $\nu$ are [[localizable measure|localizable]].  This converse is the subject of the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]].

A function $f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is [[absolutely continuous function|absolutely continuous]] iff the [[Stieltjes integral|Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure]] $\mathrm{d}f$ is absolutely continuous with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]].  (All such functions are [[continuous function|continuous]], and this example is actually the origin of the term.)

## Idea

In general, the _center_ (or _centre_) of an [[algebra|algebraic]] [[object]] $A$ is the collection of [[elements]] of $A$ which "commute with all elements of $A$."  This has a number of specific incarnations.

## Definitions

### Of groups and monoids

The original example is the __center__ $Z(G)$ of a [[group]] $G$, which is defined to be the [[subgroup]] consisting of all elements $g\in G$ such that for all elements $h\in G$ the equality $g h=h g$ holds.  The center is an [[abelian group|abelian]] subgroup, but not every abelian subgroup is in the center.  See also [[centralizer]].

This notion of center of a group can be generalized to the center of a [[monoid]] in an obvious way.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $C$ be an object in a [[2-category]]. The center of $C$, $Z(C)$ is the [[monoid]] of [[endomorphisms]] of the identity morphism, $id_C : C \rightarrow C$.
=--

One can invoke the [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] to prove that vertical and horizontal composition agree on $Z(C)$ and are commutative. 

### Of rings

The __center__ $Z(R)$ of a [[ring]] $R$ is defined to be the [[multiplicative subset]] consisting of all elements $r \in R$ such that for all elements $s \in R$, $r \cdot s = s \cdot r$ is true. $R$ is a [[commutative ring]] if $R$ is isomorphic to $Z(R)$. 

### Of Lie algebras

The __center of a [[Lie algebra]]__ $L$ is an abelian Lie subalgebra $Z(L)$, consisting of all elements $ z\in L$ such that $[l,z]=0$ for all $l\in L$. There are generalizations for some other kinds of algebras.


### Of categories and higher categories {#OfCategories}

The center of a monoid can be [[horizontal categorification|horizontally categorified]] to the center of a [[category]].  Specifically, the _center of a category_ $C$ is defined to be the commutative monoid $[C,C](Id_C,Id_C)$ of [[natural transformation|endo-natural-transformations]] of the [[identity functor]] of $C$.  It is straightforward to check that this reduces to the usual definition if $C = \mathbf{B}(A,\times)$ is the [[delooping]] of a [[monoid]]. 

* For a [[generator]] $G$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ there is an embedding of $Z(\mathcal{C})$ into the monoid $Hom(G,G)$ given by $\eta\mapsto\eta _G$. In particular, if $Hom(G,G)$ or $Z(Hom(G,G))$ is trivial, as happens e.g. for $Set$ with $G=\ast$, then so is $Z(\mathcal{C})$ (Hofmann 1975).

* For [[Cauchy completion|Cauchy complete]] $\mathcal{C}$ the idempotent elements of $Z(\mathcal{C})$ correspond precisely to the _quintessential localizations_ of $\mathcal{C}$ (Johnstone 1996).

The notion of center can also be [[vertical categorification|vertically categorified]].  It is easy to categorify the notion of center of a category as defined above: if $C$ is an [[n-category]], then its _center_ is the monoidal $(n-1)$-category $[C,C](Id_C,Id_C)$ of endo-transformations of its identity functor.  One expects that in general, this center will actually admit a natural structure of *braided* monoidal $(n-1)$-category, just as the center of a category is actually a commutative monoid, not merely a monoid.

For instance if $C = \mathbf{B}_\otimes \mathcal{C}$ is the [[delooping]] of a [[monoidal category]], then this center is called the _[[Drinfeld center]]_ of $(C, \otimes)$.


Generally, we can now obtain a notion of the center of a monoidal $n$-category by regarding it as a one-object $(n+1)$-category, according to the [[delooping hypothesis]].  It follows that the center of a monoidal $n$-category should naturally be a braided monoidal $n$-category.  This is known to be true when $n=0$ (the center of a monoid is a commutative monoid) and also for $n=1$ and $n=2$.

Note that a monoidal $n$-category has two different centers: if we regard it as a one-object $(n+1)$-category, then its center is a braided monoidal $n$-category, but if we regard it merely as an $n$-category, then its center is a braided monoidal $(n-1)$-category. The latter construction makes no reference to the monoidal structure. Likewise, a braided monoidal $n$-category has three different centers, depending on whether we regard it as an $n$-category, a connected $(n+1)$-category, or a 2-connected $(n+2)$-category, and so on (a $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category has $k+1$ different centers).

It seems that in applications, however, one is usually most interested in the sort of center of a monoidal $n$-category $C$ obtained by regarding it as a one-object $(n+1)$-category, thereby obtaining a braided monoidal $n$-category.  It is in this case, and seemingly this case only, that the center comes with a natural forgetful functor to $C$, corresponding to the classical inclusion of the center of a monoid.  (For $n\gt 0$, however, this functor will not be an inclusion; the objects of the center of $C$ are objects of $C$ equipped with additional [[stuff, structure, property|structure]].)

Moreover, one expects that if we perform this "canonical" operation on a [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]] (for $k\ge 1$), the resulting braided monoidal $n$-category will actually be $(k+1)$-tuply monoidal.  This is known to be true in the cases $n\le 4$: the center of a braided monoidal category is symmetric monoidal, the center of a braided monoidal 2-category is sylleptic, and the center of a sylleptic monoidal 2-category is symmetric.

Finally, if we decategorify further, we find that the center of a [[set]] (i.e. a [[0-category]]) is a monoidal [[(-1)-category]], i.e. the [[truth value]] "true."  This is what we ought to expect, since when $C$ is a set, there is precisely one endo-transformation of its identity endofunction (namely, the identity).

An old query about the categorical notion of center is archived at $n$Forum [here](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=2715&Focus=22852#Comment_22852).

A special case is the [[center of an abelian category]] which has a special entry because of a number of special applications and properties.

## Definition

A [[category]] is **small** if it has a [[small set]] of [[object]]s and a [[small set]] of [[morphism]]s.  

In other words, a small category is an [[internal category]] in the category [[Set]].

A category which is not small may be called [[large category|large]], especially when it is not *essentially* small (see below).


## Properties

Small categories are free of some of the subtleties that apply to large categories.

A category is said to be **essentially small** if it is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a small category.  Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], this is the same as saying that it has a small [[skeleton]], or equivalently that it is [[locally small category|locally small]] and has a [[small set|small number]] of isomorphism classes of objects.

A **small category structure** on a [[locally small category]] $C$ is an [[essentially surjective functor]] from a set (as a [[discrete category]]) to $C$.  A category is essentially small iff it is locally small and has a small category structure; unlike the previous paragraph, this result does not require the axiom of choice.


## Smallness in the context of universes
 {#SmallnessInTheContextOfUniverses}

If [[Grothendieck universe]]s are being used, then for $U$ a fixed Grothendieck universe, a category $C$ is **$U$-small** if its collection of objects and collection of morphisms are both elements of $U$. Thus, 

* a $U$-small category is a category [[internal category|internal to]] $U Set$.

This of course is a [[material set theory|material]] formulation. We may call $C$ **structurally $U$-small** if there is a [[bijection]] from its set of morphisms to an element of $U$ (the same for the set of objects follows). This gives an up-to-isomorphism version of $U$-smallness (see [[universe in a topos]] for an alternative structural formulation). Such structural $U$-smallness may be substituted in the discussion below. 

Let $U\Set$ be the category of $U$-small sets. Similar considerations lead us to say

* a $U$-category (a [[locally small category|locally U-small]])-category is a category [[enriched category|enriched over]] $U Set$,  

and that a category $C$ **essentially $U$-small** if it is locally $U$-small and admits an essentially surjective functor from a discrete $U$-small category. 

A category is **$U$-moderate** if its set of objects and set of morphisms are both subsets of $U$.  However, some categories (such as the category of $U$-moderate categories!) are larger yet.

# Identity elements
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definitions

Given an operation ([[function]]) $*\colon X \times Y \to Y$, an element $e$ of $X$ is called a __left identity__ for $*$ if $e * a = a$ for every element $a$ of $Y$.  That is, the map $Y \to Y$ given by $e * -$ is the [[identity function]] on $Y$.

If $*\colon Y \times X \to Y$, then there is a similar concept of __right identity__.

If $*\colon X \times X \to X$, then $e$ is a __two-sided identity__, or simply __identity__, if it is both a left and right identity.

Identity elements are sometimes also called __neutral elements__.


## Related notions

Historically, identity elements (as above) came first, then [[identity functions]], and then [[identity morphisms]].  These are all the same basic idea, however: an identity morphism is an identity element for the operation of [[composition]].

An identity is also called a [[neutral element]] or sometimes a __[[unit]]__ (although that term also has a broader meaning, and an operation that has an identity element is called __unital__ or __unitary__).  In particular, a [[magma]] whose underlying operation $*\colon X \times X \to X$ has an identity is called a __[[unital magma]]__ or a __unitary magma__.

Similarly, a __unit law__ is the statement that a given operation has an identity element.  In [[higher category theory]], we generalise from the [[property]] of uniticity/unitality to the [[structure]] of a [[unitor]].

* The identity element in a [[matrix algebra]] is the corresponding [[identity matrix]].

A **submonoid** of a [[monoid]] $M$ with unit $1$ is a subset $N$ of $M$ containing $1$ which is also a monoid with respect to the inherited multiplication.

## Examples ##

* Given a group $G$, any subgroup is a submonoid.
* Given a category $C$ and a subcategory $D$, an object $X$ in both, the monoid $\Hom_D(X,X)$ is a submonoid of $\Hom_C(X,X)$.

# Units

## Idea

Considering a [[ring]] $R$, then by _the unit element_ or _the multiplicative unit_ one usually means the [[neutral element]] $1 \in R$ with respect to [[multiplication]]. This is the sense of "unit" in terms such as _[[nonunital ring]]_.

But more generally _a unit element_ in a unital (!) ring is any element that has an [[inverse element]] under [[multiplication]]. 

This concept generalizes beyond [[rings]], and this is what is discussed in the following.



## Definitions

Exactly what this means depends on context.  A very general definition is this:

Given [[sets]] $R$ and $M$, and a [[function]] ${\cdot}\colon R \times M \to M$, an [[element]] $u$ of $M$ is a __unit__ (relative to the operation ${\cdot}$) if, given any element $x$ of $M$, there exists a unique element $a$ of $R$ such that $x = a \cdot u$.

That is, every element of $M$ is a multiple (in a unique way) of $u$, where 'multiple' is defined in terms of the operation ${\cdot}$.


### Units in rings

If $R$ is a [[ring]] (or [[rig]]), then $R$ comes equipped with a multiplication map ${\cdot}\colon R \times R \to R$.  So $R$ can play the role of both $R$ and $M$ above, although there are two ways to do this: on the left and on the right.

We find that $u$ is a __left unit__ if and only if $u$ has a [[left inverse]], and $u$ is a __right unit__ if and only if $u$ has a [[right inverse]].  First, an element $u$ with an inverse is a unit because, given any element $x$, we have
$$ x = (x u^{-1}) u $$
(on the left) or
$$ x = u (u^{-1} x) $$
(on the right).  Conversely, a unit must have an inverse, since there must a solution to
$$ 1 = a u $$
(on the left) or
$$ 1 = u a $$
(on the right).

In a [[commutative ring]] (or rig), a __unit__ is an element of $R$ that has an [[inverse element|inverse]], period.  Of course, a commutative ring $R$ is a [[field]] just when every non-[[zero]] element is a unit.


### Units in monoids

Notice that addition plays no role in the characterisation above of a unit in a ring.  Accordingly, a unit in a [[monoid]] may be defined in precisely the same way.

A [[group]] is precisely a monoid in which every element is a unit.


### Units in rngs or semigroups

In a [[rng]] (or, ignoring addition, in a [[semigroup]]), we cannot speak of inverses of elements.  However, we can still talk about units; $u$ is a __left unit__ if, for every $x$, there is an $a$ such that
$$ x = a u ;$$
and $u$ is a __right unit__ if, for every $x$, there is an $a$ such that
$$ x = u a .$$


### Units in nonassocative rings or magmas

In a [[nonassociative algebra|nonassociative ring]] (or, ignoring addition, in a [[magma]]), even if we have an identity element, an invertible element might not be a unit.  So we must use the same explicit definition as in a rng (or semigroup) above.

A [[quasigroup]] is precisely a magma in which every element is a two-sided unit.


### Units in modules

If $R$ is a [[ring]] (or [[rig]]) and $M$ an $R$-[[module]], then a __unit__ in $M$ is an element $u \in M$ such that every other $x \in M$ can be written as $x = a u$ (or $x = u a$ for a right module) for some $a \in R$.  This is the same as a [[generator]] of $M$ as an $R$-module.  There is no need to distinguish left and right units unless $M$ is a [[bimodule]].  Note that a (left or right) unit in $R$ _qua_ ring is the same as a unit in $R$ _qua_ (left or right) $R$-module.


### Units of measurement
 {#UnitsOfMeasurement}

In [[physics]], the quantities of a given dimension generally form an $\mathbb{R}$-[[line]], a $1$-dimensional [[real vector space]]. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[field]], any non-[[zero]] element is a unit, called in this context a __[[unit of measurement]]__.  This is actually a special case of a unit in a module, where $R \coloneqq \mathbb{R}$ and $M$ is the line in question.

Often (but not always) these quantities form an [[orientation|oriented]] line, so that nonzero quantities are either positive or negative.  Then we usually also require a unit of measurement to be positive.  In fact, for some dimensions, there is no physical meaning to a negative quantity, in which case the quantities actually form a module over the rig $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and every nonzero element is "positive."

For example, the [[kilogram]] is a unit of mass, because any mass may be expressed as a real multiple of the kilogram.  Further, it is a positive unit; the mass of any physical object is a nonnegative quantity (so that mass quantities actually form an $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$-module) and may be expressed as a nonnegative real multiple of the kilogram.


## Identities as units

Often the term 'unit' (or 'unity') is used as a synonym for '[[identity element]]', especially when this identity element is denoted $1$.  For example, a 'ring with unit' (or 'ring with unity') is a ring with an identity (used by authors who say 'ring' for a rng).  Of course, a rng with identity has a unit, since $1$ itself is a unit; conversely, a commutative rng with a unit must have an identity.
+-- {: .query}
I haven\'t managed to find either a proof or a counterexample to the converse (in the noncommutative case): that a rng with a unit must have an identity.

Response: If $R$ is a rng with a unit $u$, then every element uniquely factors through $u$. In particular, $u$ itself does. $u = a u$, with $a$ unique. So $a$ is an identity.

Reply: Why is $a$ an identity then?  This works if the rng is commutative: given any $v$, write $v$ as $b u$, and then $a v = a (b u) = b (a u) = b u = v$.  But without commutativity (and associativity), this doesn\'t work.
=--

It is this meaning of 'unit' which gives rise to the [[unit of an adjunction]].

   1. a [[associativity|associative]] [[unitality|unitality]] [[function]]

   1. $(-)\cdot (-) \;\colon\; G \times G \to G$,

   1. a function $(-)^{-1} \;\colon\; G \to G$ such that $g \cdot g^{-1} = e = g^{-1} \cdot g$ for all $g \in G$;

1. a topology $\tau_G \subset P(G)$ giving $G$ the structure of a [[topological space]]

such that the operations $(-)^{-1}$ and $(-)\cdot (-)$ are [[continuous functions]] (the latter with respect to the [[product topology]]).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption of local compactness, there exists a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[neighbourhood]] $C_e \subset G$ of the [[neutral element]]. We may assume without restriction of generality that with $g \in C_e$ any element, then also the [[inverse element]] $g^{-1} \in C_e$.

For if this is not the case, then we may enlarge $C_e$ by including its inverse elements, and the result is still a compact neighbourhood of the neutral element: Since taking [[inverse elements]] $(-)^{-1} \colon G \to G$ is a [[continuous function]], and since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]], it follows that also the set of inverse elements to elements in $C_e$ is compact, and the union of two compact subspaces is still compact (obviously, otherwise see [this prop](compact+space#UnionsAndIntersectionOfCompactSubspaces)). 

Now for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, write $C_e^n  \subset G$ for the [[image]] of $\underset{k \in \{1, \cdots n\}}{\prod} C_e \subset \underset{k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod} G$ under the iterated group product operation $\underset{k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod} G \longrightarrow G$.

Then 

$$
  H \coloneqq 
   \underset
   {n \in \mathbb{N}}
   {\cup} 
  C_e^n
    \;\subset\; 
  G
$$ 

is clearly a topological subgroup of $G$. 

Observe that each $C_e^n$ is compact. This is because $\underset{k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod}C_e$ is compact by the [[Tychonoff theorem]], and since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]]. Thus 

$$
  H = \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} C_e^n
$$

is a countable union of compact subspaces, making it [[sigma-compact]]. Since [[locally compact and sigma-compact spaces are paracompact]], this implies that $H$ is paracompact.

Observe also that the subgroup $H$ is open, because it contains with the [[interior]] of $C_e$ a non-empty open subset $Int(C_e) \subset H$ and we may hence write $H$ as a union of open subsets

$$
  H = \underset{h \in H}{\cup} Int(C_e) \cdot h
  \,.
$$

Finally, as indicated in the proof of Lemma \ref{OpenSubgroupOfTopologicalGroupIsClosed}, the cosets of the open subgroup $H$ are all open and partition $G$ as a [[disjoint union space]] ([[coproduct]] in [[Top]]) of these open cosets. From this we may draw the following conclusions. 

* In the particular case where $G$ is connected, then there is just one such coset, namely $H$ itself. The argument above thus shows that a connected locally compact topological group is $\sigma$-compact and (by local compactness) also paracompact.

* In the general case, all the cosets are homeomorphic to $H$ which we have just shown to be a paracompact group. Thus $G$ is a [[disjoint union space]] of paracompact spaces. This is again paracompact (by [this prop.](paracompact+topological+space#ParacompactnessPreservedByDisjointUnion)).

### Uniform structure

A topological group $G$ carries two canonical [[uniform space|uniformities]]: a right and left uniformity. The **right uniformity** consists of entourages $\sim_{l, U}$ where $x \sim_{l, U} y$ if $x y^{-1} \in U$; here $U$ ranges over neighborhoods of the identity that are symmetric: $g \in U \Leftrightarrow g^{-1} \in U$. The **left uniformity** similarly consists of entourages $\sim_{r, U}$ where $x \sim_{r, U} y$ if $x^{-1} y \in U$. The uniform topology for either coincides with the topology of $G$. 

Obviously when $G$ is commutative, the left and right uniformities coincide. They also coincide if $G$ is compact Hausdorff, since in that case there is only one uniformity whose uniform topology reproduces the given topology. 

Let $G$, $H$ be topological groups, and equip each with their left uniformities. Let $f: G \to H$ be a group homomorphism. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
######Proposition
The following are equivalent: 

* The map $f$ is continuous at a point of $G$; 

* The map $f$ is continuous; 

* The map $f$ is uniformly continuous. 

=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
Suppose $f$ is continuous at $g \in G$. Since neighborhoods of a point $x$ are $x$-translates of neighborhoods of the identity $e$, continuity at $g$ means that for all neighborhoods $V$ of $e \in H$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $e \in G$ such that 

$$f(g U) \subseteq f(g) V$$

Since $f$ is a homomorphism, it follows immediately from cancellation that $f(U) \subseteq V$. Therefore, for every neighborhood $V$ of $e \in H$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $e \in G$ such that 

$$x y^{-1} \in U \Rightarrow f(x) f(y)^{-1} = f(x y^{-1}) \in V$$ 

in other words such that $x \sim_U y \Rightarrow f(x) \sim_V f(y)$. Hence $f$ is uniformly continuous with respect to the right uniformity. By similar reasoning, $f$ is uniformly continuous with respect to the right uniformity.

### Unitary representation on Hilbert spaces

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A unitary [[representation]] $R$ of a topological group $G$ in a [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$ is a continuous [[group homomorphism]]

$$
   R \colon G \to \mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})
$$

where [[U(H)|$\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$]] is the group of [[unitary operators]] on $\mathcal{H}$ with respect to the [[strong topology]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Here [[U(H)|$\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$]] is a complete, metrizable topological group in the [[strong topology]], see ([Schottenloher, prop. 3.11](#Schottenloher)).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


In [[physics]], when a [[classical mechanical system]] is symmetric, i.e. invariant in a proper sense, with respect to the action of a topological group $G$, then an unitary representation of $G$ is sometimes called a **quantization** of $G$. See at _[[geometric quantization]]_ and _[[orbit method]]_ for more on this.

=--


#### Why the strong topology is used

The reason that in the definition of a [[unitary representation]], the [[strong operator topology]] on $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$ is used and not the [[norm topology]], is that only few [[homomorphisms]] turn out to be [[continuous map|continuous]] in the norm topology.

Example: let $G$ be a [[compact Lie group]] and $L^2(G)$ be the [[Hilbert space]] of square integrable [[measurable function]]s with respect to its [[Haar measure]]. The right [[regular representation]] of $G$ on $L^2(G)$ is defined as

$$
      R: G \to \mathcal{U}(L^2(G))
$$

$$
         g \mapsto (R_g: f(x) \mapsto f(x g))
$$

and this will generally not be continuous in the norm topology, but is always continuous in the strong topology.

# Completions
* table of contents
{:toc}

## Idea

The general idea of completion is that given an object of some sort $C$, we construct from it a larger object, containing $C$ as a subobject, which moreover has certain properties that $C$ might have lacked.  This larger object is then called the _completion_ of $C$ with respect to these properties.


## Completion and idempotence

Outside of category theory (see below), "completion" is usually used mostly for *idempotent* operations.  That is, the completion of a thing with respect to some property is itself *complete* with respect to that property, and the completion process doesn't change an object that is already complete.  From the perspective of [[stuff, structure, property]] this makes sense because we complete with respect to a *property*.  Namely, according to the yoga of SSP, given some ambient category $K$, the subcategory of objects having a property $P$ should be a *full* subcategory, whose inclusion [[functor]] forgets that property.  A "completion" operation is then usually a left (or, occasionally, right) [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] to that inclusion functor, making the category of objects with property $P$ [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] (or coreflective).  Note that a [[full and faithful functor]] with a left adjoint is always [[monadic functor|monadic]] and the monad is [[idempotent monad|idempotent]].

By contrast, when we add *structure* to objects, i.e. we consider an adjoint to a forgetful functor which is faithful but not necessarily full, we usually do not use the word "completion" but rather the word "free".  For example, the category of complete [[metric spaces]] is a full reflective subcategory of the category of metric spaces, and the reflection is called "completion."  By contrast, the forgetful functor from the category of groups to the category of sets has a left adjoint, but we call that left adjoint the "free group on a set" rather than the "completion of a set into a group."

Additionally, we tend to use the term 'completion' only for a [[faithful functor|faithful]] [[reflector]].  Note that the reflector is faithful if and only if the unit of the reflection is [[monomorphism|monic]]; we might even want to require it to be a [[regular monomorphism]].  For example, the left adjoint of the forgetful functor from [[abelian groups]] to groups is called 'abelianisation' and may even be called 'free abelian group on a group' but is not normally called 'abelian completion' or anything like that. (The tendency in such cases is rather to resort to suffixes like "-ification" and "-ization": sheafification, abelianization, localization.) This fits with the intuition that a completion "adds more stuff" to the object we started with in order to "make it complete".

David: It's not clear to me when in the 'List of completions' we have examples of enriched category completions: Cauchy completion of a metric space (yes) of a uniform space (no?), Dedekind completion of a linear order (yes for 2-enriched categories?). 

[[Mike Shulman]]: Although orders are 2-enriched categories, Dedekind completion of an order is not a categorical completion, at least not in the sense of adding limits or colimits.  That would be the construction of downsets or ideals.

Cauchy completion of a metric space is, of course, an instance of Cauchy completion of enriched categories.  I believe that Cauchy completion of a uniform space is actually also an instance of a general categorical notion of Cauchy completion, but in the more general setting of an [[equipment]] (namely, the equipment of sets and filters).  See "Categorical interpretation" at [[uniform space]] for a too-brief summary of this point of view.

[[David Corfield]]: so is there are clear-cut distinction of level in all these cases, where we can separate completions of (enriched) categories (equipment) from completions of sets (with properties and structures)?

[[Mike Shulman]]: I think the reason that completion of metric spaces and uniform spaces feels more like the completion of sets (than categories) is that they are basically (enriched) (0,1)-categories.  If the question is where to separate this list from the one below, I would put completions of anything enriched in a preorder up here, and completions of things enriched non-posetally below.

## Free completion and lax-idempotence

The general contrast between "completion" for adding a property and "free" for adding structure applies to operations on [[category|categories]] as well.  For instance, since [[split idempotents]] are preserved by any functor, the 2-category of categories with split idempotents is a full sub-2-category of [[Cat]].  Therefore, it makes perfect sense to call the left adjoint of its inclusion a "completion," in this case the (Set-enriched) [[Cauchy completion]] or [[Karoubi envelope]].  By contrast, the forgetful functor from the 2-category of [[monoidal categories]] to $Cat$ forgets structure, rather than properties, so its left adjoint should be called a "free" construction rather than a "completion."

However, in this case there is an intermediate notion between properties and structure, namely [[property-like structure]].  Intuitively, property-like structure is "structure which, when it exists, is essentially unique" or "a property which is not necessarily preserved by morphisms."  The canonical example is the existence of [[limits]] and [[colimits]] in a category: when they exist they are unique up to unique canonical isomorphism (so that "having limits" is intuitively a property of a category), but not every functor preserves limits, so the forgetful functor from  categories-with-limits to categories is not full.  (Left) adjoints to functors which forget property-like structure are usually called *free completions*.  The monads they induce are not idempotent, but they are often [[lax-idempotent monad|lax-idempotent]] or colax-idempotent.  (For example, when we freely add limits to a category that already had limits, the old limits are no longer limits and the new ones take their place.)

Property-like structure is most common in category theory, but it does occur elsewhere as well.  For instance, a [[monoid]] is a [[semigroup]] with property-like structure: a semigroup has at most one identity element, but that identity element is not necessarily preserved by semigroup homomorphisms.  Thus the adjoining of a new formal identity element to a semigroup (which is not an idempotent operation) might be called its "free completion into a monoid".  Notice that if the original semigroup is already a monoid, then its free completion into a monoid will be a *different* monoid (with a new identity); this shows the distinction between free completion and mere completion.


## List of completions in category theory

### Idempotent completions

The following completions add a *property* in the strictest sense, and as such are idempotent.

* [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy completion]] of an enriched category: addition of all absolute limits.
* [[exact completion]] of a [[regular category]] (the "ex/reg" completion)
* [[extensive category|extensive]] completion
* [[pretopos]] completion of a [[coherent category]]


### Non-idempotent completions

These completions add a property-like structure, are often lax-idempotent or colax-idempotent.

* [[free cocompletion]]: the [[presheaf category]] of a [[small category]] is its free cocompletion under all small colimits.
* [[free completion]]: the dual (the opposite of the free cocompletion of the opposite).
* Ind-completion: the "free cocompletion under [[filtered colimits]]," consisting of all [[ind-object|ind-objects]].
* Pro-completion: the dual (free completion under cofiltered limits, the opposite of the Ind-completion of the opposite), consisting of all [[pro-objects]].
* [[ideal completion]]: the free cocompletion under filtered colimits of monomorphisms.

Note that these completions take small categories to large categories.  Free completions and cocompletions of large categories can be obtained using categories of [[accessible functor|accessible presheaves]].  However, if we only want to add limits and/or colimits for a given *set* of diagram shapes, the free completion process will preserve smallness.  For example we have:

* the free completion under finite products or coproducts
* the free completions under finite limits or colimits

All these sorts of completions work just as well in an [[enriched category|enriched]] setting, as long as the enriching category $V$ is nice enough ([[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] is certainly enough).

Some other non-idempotent completions:

* The [[reg/lex completion]] and [[ex/lex completion]] of a category with finite limits.


## Non-unique completions
{#nonunique}

The completions above are mostly (all?) [[the|unique in the relevant sense]]: unique up to unique isomorphism for objects of [[groupoids]] (or [[categories]]), more generally with a [[contractible space|contractible]] $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]] of completions.

However, there are other sorts of completions in mathematics, such as:

*  'The' [[algebraic closure]] of a [[field]] is unique up to isomorphism, but the isomorphism is not unique. This is an example of an [[injective hull]].
*  Every [[model theory|model]] of a [[first-order theory]] may be interpreted as giving a completion of that theory (but not one with a recursively enumerable axiomatisation); every statement that is true in the model is an axiom of the complete theory.  However, this is far from unique.
*  An [[ultrapower]] of a structure may be viewed as an elementary completion (see [[elementary embedding]]), as described by [[Terry Tao]] in [a blog post](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/11/27/nonstandard-analysis-as-a-completion-of-standard-analysis/).

## Idea
 {#Idea}

Given a [[category with weak equivalences]] $(\mathcal{C},W)$, then its _homotopy category_ $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ is, if it exists, the result of universally forcing the [[weak equivalences]] to become actual [[isomorphisms]], also called the _[[localization]]_ at the weak equivalences

$$
  \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow Ho(\mathcal{C})= \mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]
  \,.
$$

The classical example is the category of [[topological spaces]] with weak equivalences those [[continuous functions]] which are _[[homotopy equivalences]]_ or _[[weak homotopy equivalences]]_. The corresponding homotopy category is often referred to as "the homotopy category", by default, or the "[[classical homotopy category]]" for emphasis. This turns out to be equivalent to the category of topological spaces or (for weak homotopy equivalences) of just those [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to [[CW-complexes]] with [[left homotopy]]-[[homotopy class|classes]] of continuous functions between them, whence the name "homotopy category".

The existence of a homotopy category, as well as tractable presentations of it typically require extra [[properties]] of the class of weak equivalences (such as that they admit a [[calculus of fractions]]) or even extra [[structure]] (such as [[fibration category]]/[[cofibration category]] structure, or full [[model category]] structure, or further enhancements of that to [[simplicial model category]] structures, etc). See at _[[homotopy category of a model category]]_ for more on this.

More generally, to every [[(∞,1)-category]] is associated a homotopy category, whose morphisms are literally the [[homotopy classes]] of the original morphisms. See at _[[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]]_ for more on this.

These two concepts of "homotopy category" are compatible: to a [[category with weak equivalences]] is associated, if it exists, an [[(∞,1)-category]] obtained by universally forcing the [[weak equivalences]] to become actual [[homotopy equivalences]], also called the _[[simplicial localization]]_ $L_W \mathcal{C}$ at the weak equivalences. The homotopy categories of $(\mathcal{C},W)$ and of $L_W \mathcal{C}$ coincide, which justifies the terminology "homotopy category" generally.


## Definition

### For simplicially enriched categories

Given a simplicially enriched category $C$, we can form for each pair of objects, $x,y$, of objects of $C$, the set, $\pi_0C(x,y)$, of connected components of the 'function space' $C(x,y)$.  As $\pi_0$ preserves finite limits, this gives a category, denoted $\pi_0(C)$.  As 1-simplices in $C(x,y)$ can be often interpreted as being homotopies, this category $\pi_0(C)$ is often called the _homotopy category of $C$_, and then the notation $Ho(C)$ may be used.  


This notions is closely related to the next, by using, say the [[hammock localisation]] of Dwyer and Kan, as then $\pi_0$ of that simplicially enriched category, coincides with the following.

### For categories with weak equivalences

Given a [[category with weak equivalences]] (such as a [[model category]]), its __homotopy category__ $Ho(C)$ is -- if it exists -- the [[category]] which is universal with the property that there is a [[functor]]

$$
 Q :  C \to Ho(C)
$$

that sends every weak equivalence in $C$ to an [[isomorphism]] in $Ho(C)$. 

One also writes $Ho(C) := W^{-1}C$ or $C[W^{-1}]$ and calls it the [[localization]] of $C$ at the collection $W$ of weak equivalences.

More in detail, the universality of $Ho(C)$ means the following:

* for any (possibly [[large category|large]]) category $A$ and functor $F : C \to A$ such that $F$ sends all $w \in W$ to isomorphisms in $A$, there exists a functor $F_Q : Ho(C) \to A$ and a natural isomorphism

$$
  \array{
     C &&\stackrel{F}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow^Q& \Downarrow^{\simeq}& \nearrow_{F_Q}
     \\
     Ho(C)
  }
$$


* the functor $Q^* : Func(Ho(C),A) \to Func(C,A)$ is a [[full and faithful functor]].


The second condition implies that the functor $F_Q$ in the first condition is unique up to unique isomorphism.


## Properties

* If it exists, the homotopy category $Ho(C)$ is unique up to [[equivalence of categories]].



* As described at [[localization]], in general, the morphisms of $Ho(C)$ must be constructed using zigzags of morphisms in $C$ in which the backwards-pointing arrows are weak equivalences.  This means that in general, $Ho(C)$ need not be [[locally small category|locally small]] even if $C$ is.  However, in many cases (such as any [[model category]]) there is a more direct description of the morphisms in $Ho(C)$ as [[homotopy]] classes of maps in $C$ between suitably "good" (fibrant and cofibrant) objects.

* In [[2-limit|2-categorical terms]], the homotopy category $Ho(C)$ is the _coinverter_ of the canonical 2-cell
$$\array{& \to \\ W & \Downarrow & C\\ & \to}$$
where $W$ is the category whose objects are morphisms in $C$ and whose morphisms are commutative squares in $C$.



## Examples

* In classical [[homotopy theory]], _the_ homotopy category refers to the homotopy category [[Ho(Top)]] of [[Top]] with weak equivalences taken to be [[weak homotopy equivalences]].

* [[Ho(Top)]] is often restricted to the [[full subcategory]] of spaces of the [[homotopy type]] of a [[CW-complex]] (the full subcategory of CW-complexes in $Ho(Top)$). This is equivalent to $Ho(sSet_{Quillen})$, the homotopy category of the standard Quillen-[[model structure on simplicial sets]]. This equivalence is one aspect of the [[homotopy hypothesis]].

* In [[homological algebra]] the localization of the [[category of chain complexes]] at the [[quasi-isomorphisms]] is called the _[[derived category]]_. But see also at _[[homotopy category of chain complexes]]_.

* In [[stable homotopy theory]] one considers the [[stable homotopy category]] of [[spectra]].

* In [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] one considers the [[equivariant stable homotopy category]] of spectra.

* For the homotopy category of [[Cat]], see [[Ho(Cat)]].

* For the homotopy category of that of [[combinatorial model categories]] see [[Ho(CombModCat)]].

The [[commutator subgroup]] of $G$ is the subgroup of $G$ generated by the commutators $[g,h]$ for all $g, h \in G$. A group is solvable if the series of groups produced by repeatedly taking the commutator subgroup, the [[derived series]], terminates with the [[trivial group]] after finitely many steps.
\end{definition}

## Examples

\begin{example}\label{GaloisGroups}
**([[Galois groups]])**\linebreak
The terminology "solvable groups" comes from elementary [[Galois theory]]: every [[polynomial]] [[equation]] $\phi$ over an [[integral domain]] $K$ has a corresponding [[Galois group]] $Gal(\phi/K)$, and $Gal(\phi/K)$ is a solvable group if and only if $\phi$ is a [[solvable polynomial equation|solvable equation]] (meaning that all its solutions in an [[algebraic closure]] of $K$ are expressible using the elements of $K$, the field operations, and extraction of roots).
\end{example}

Informally, this can be thought of as each step in the derived series of the Galois group requiring an additional level of nesting of radicals. If the derived series does not terminate, then the solutions of the polynomial equation cannot be expressed by radicals, no matter how deeply nested.

\begin{example}\label{NilpotentGroups}
**([[nilpotent groups]])**
A [[nilpotent group]] is a solvable group given by *[[central extensions|central]]* [[group extensions]].
\end{example}

A __transitive relation__ is a [[semicategory]] or [[magmoid]] $A$ such that for all objects $a$ and $b$ in $A$, there are no more than one morphism with domain $a$ and codomain $b$. Equivalently, a transitive relation is a semicategory or magmoid [[enriched category|enriched]] on [[truth values]]. 

[[set theory|Set theoretically]], a (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a [[set]] $A$ is __transitive__ if in every chain of $3$ pairwise related elements, the first and last elements are also related:
$$\forall (x, y, z: A),\; x \sim y \;\wedge\; y \sim z \;\Rightarrow\; x \sim z$$
which generalises from $3$ to any finite, positive number of elements.

In the language of the $2$-poset [[Rel]] of sets and relations, a relation $R: A \to A$ is __transitive__ if it contains its composite with itself:
$$R^2 \subseteq R$$
from which it follows that $R^n \subseteq R$ for any positive [[natural number]] $n$.  To include the case where $n = 0$, we must explicitly state that the relation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].

Transitive relations are often understood as [[orders]].

## Idea

For $S$ a [[simplicial set]] and $A$ an [[abelian group]], the _simplicial [[homology]]_ of $S$ is the [[chain homology]] of the [[chain complex]] corresponding under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to the [[simplicial abelian group]] $S \cdot A$ of $A$-[[chains]] on $S$: [[formal linear combinations]] of [[simplices]] in $S$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [[simplicial set]] and $A$ an [[abelian group]].

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write 

$$
  S_n \cdot A \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}[S_n] \otimes A
$$

for the [[free abelian group]] on the set $S_n$  of $n$-[[simplices]] [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensored]] with $A$: the group of [[formal linear combinations]] of $n$-simplices with [[coefficients]] in $A$.

These abelian groups arrange to a [[simplicial abelian group]]

$$
  X \cdot A \in Ab^{\Delta^{op}}
  \,.
$$

The [[alternating face map complex]] of these groups is called the **complex of simplicial chains** on $S$

$$
  C_\bullet(S \cdot A) = C_\bullet(S,A)
  \,.
$$

The **simplicial homology** of $S$ is the [[chain homology]] of the complex of simplicial chains:

$$
  H_\bullet(S, A)
  \coloneqq
  H_\bullet(C_\bullet(S,A))
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This means that the [[differentials]] in $C_\bullet(S,A)$ are given on [[basis]] elements $\sigma \in S_n$ by the [[formal linear combination]]

$$
  \partial \sigma
    = 
  \sum_{k = 0}^{n} (-1)^k d_k \sigma
  \,,
$$

where $d_k : S_n \to S_{n-1}$ are the [[face maps]] of $S$.

=--

## Examples

### Explicit

+-- {: .num_example #OfTetrahedon}
###### Example

Let $S = \partial \Delta^3$ be the [[boundary of a simplex|boundary]] of the simplicial  3-[[simplex]], the (hollow) simplicial [[tetrahedron]].

Since this has 

* 4 non-degenerate vertices

* 6 non-degenerate edges

* 4 non-degenerate faces

the [[normalized chain complex]] of $\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form

$$
  \cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z}^4 \to \mathbb{Z}^6 \to \mathbb{Z}^4 \to 0
  \,.
$$

By writing out the two non-trivial differentials, one can deduce explicitly that 

* $H_0(\partial \Delta^3) = \mathbb{Z}$ (reflecting the fact that the tetrahedron is [[connected topological space|connected]]);

* $H_1(\partial \Delta^3) = 0$ (reflecting the fact that it is [[simply-connected topological space|simply-connected]]);

* $H_2(\partial \Delta^3) = \mathbb{Z}$ (reflecting the fact, by the [[Hurewicz theorem]], that the second [[homotopy group]] of the 2-sphere is $\mathbb{Z}$ );


=--


### General

* For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $S = Sing X$ the [[singular simplicial complex]] of $X$, the simplicial homology of $Sing X$ is called the _[[singular homology]]_ of $X$, denoted $H_\bullet(X,A)$.


## Related concepts

* [[cochain on a simplicial set]]

* [[singular homology]]

## Terminology and a bit of history

The term simplicial homology is also used in the literature for the homology of polyhedral spaces, based on the theory of [[simplicial complex]]es.  That homology is defined by first looking at a chain complex of simplicial chains on, say, a triangulation of a space, and then passing to the corresponding homology.  The theory then proceeds by proving that the end result is independent of the triangulation used.  The resulting homology theory is isomorphic to singular homology, but historically was the earlier theory.

## Definition

A **division algebra** is a possibly [[non-associative algebra]] $A$, typically over a [[field]] $k$, which has the property that for any nonzero element $a$ and any element $b$, the equations $a x=b$ and $x a=b$ each have a unique solution for $x$ in the algebra. 

Usually the algebra is assumed to have a [[unital magma|multiplicative identity]], in which case this condition implies that each element has a left inverse and a right inverse. These inverses necessarily coincide if the algebra is [[associative algebra|associative]], but this may fail in the absence of associativity.

A sub-topic of interest is the existence of a multiplicative norm for the algebra, see at _[[normed division algebra]]_.


### Other definitions

An alternative definition is used in [Baez 02](#Baez02): The axioms given there require that the algebra is finite-dimensional over $k$ and that for any $a$ and $b$ in the algebra, $a b = 0$ implies at least one of $a$ or $b$ is already $0$.  This coincides with the definition given above for [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite dimensional]] algebras.


## Examples

* Perhaps the most famous division algebras are the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$, the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$, the [[quaternions]] $\mathbb{H}$, and the [[octonions]] $\mathbb{O}$. According to the [[Hurwitz theorem]], these are the only normed, finite dimensional, real division algebras.

* Any [[division ring]] is an associative division algebra over its [[center]] and has identity, but it may not be finite dimensional over its center.

* The ring of rational [[polynomials]] $\mathbb{R}(X)$ is an infinite dimensional real associative division algebra.


* There exists a division algebra with identity that does not have two-sided inverses for every nonzero element.


## Counter-examples

* There exists a [[reciprocal algebra]] with nonzero zero divisors.

* The [[sedenions]] $\mathbb{S}$ are a finite-dimensional normed real algebra that is not a division algebra (it has zero divisors.)

* The ideal generated by $Y$ in the [[polynomial ring]] $\mathbb{R}[Y]$ is an associative, commutative, infinite dimensional real algebra without identity and without zero divisors. The equation $Yx=Y$ does not have a solution for $Y$ in the algebra.

## Related concepts

For many applications (also to [[physics]]) the most interesting division algebras are the [[normed division algebras]] over the [[real numbers]]: By the [[Hurwitz theorem]] these are the [[real numbers]], [[complex numbers]], [[quaternion|quaternions]] and [[octonion|octonions]].  These have important relations to [[division algebras and supersymmetry|supersymmetry]].

# Unnatural isomorphisms #
* table of contents
{:toc}

## Idea

A [[natural isomorphism]] is the "correct" notion of [[isomorphism]] between [[functors]].  Informally, one sometimes speaks of two [[objects]] being "naturally isomorphic" if they are the images of two functors that are naturally isomorphic.  However, sometimes one encounters functors that are "pointwise isomorphic" but *not* naturally.  There is not much to say *mathematically* about such "unnatural isomorphisms", but some discussion of them can help the intuitive understanding of natural isomorphisms and their importance.

On this page we will adhere to the convention that an "unnatural isomorphism" means an isomorphism that is not *necessarily* natural (but might be), similarly to how a "noncommutative [[ring]]" might happen to be commutative.  The word "unnatural" is not to be taken perjoratively or as suggesting that unnatural isomorphisms are rare; in [[cardinality]] terms there are many more unnatural isomorphisms than natural ones, although in mathematical practice surprisingly many isomorphisms are indeed natural.  Other possible terms with the same meaning are "pointwise isomorphic" or "objectwise isomorphic".

The term "natural" is used for traditional reasons, cf. [EilenbergMac Lane45](#EilenbergMacLane45), and is an example of the common phenomenon that concepts branded _natural_, _normal_ or _regular_ tend to be rather non-generic or non-random.  In fact, [Eilenberg and MacLane](#EilenbergMacLane45) comment (cf. p. 233, first paragraph in loc. cit) on the term, associating it with an intuition of _simultaneity_, rather than genericity.  This intuition is in tune with conceiving of naturality as generalized _commutatitivity_.

## Definition

### Between functors

Let $F,G:C\to D$ be [[functors]].  An *unnatural isomorphism* between $F$ and $G$ consists of, for each [[object]] $c\in C$, an isomorphism $F(c) \cong G(c)$, satisfying no further conditions.

In other words, it is an [[unnatural transformation]] whose components are isomorphisms, or equivalently that is an isomorphism in the category of unnatural transformations.

Note that if each component of a [[natural transformation]] is an isomorphism, then it is necessarily a natural isomorphism.  (Depending on the definition of "natural isomorphism", this could be a tautology; but the non-tautologous statement is that if each component of a natural transformation is an isomorphism then it is an isomorphism in the functor category.  This statement, though non-tautologous, is easy to prove for 1-categories, but more difficult for higher categories.)

More generally, an unnatural isomorphism (or transformation) might be natural with respect to only *some* morphisms in the domain, such as for instance the isomorphisms.  Some people have proposed calling transformations that are natural only with respect to isomorphisms "canonical".

### Between objects

If one says that two *objects* $A$ and $B$ are "unnaturally isomorphic", it might mean that they are the images of two functors that are unnaturally isomorphic, but it might also mean only that there is no obvious way even to make them the images of two functors. For instance, this seems to be the meaning in Section 1.1 of [Strickland](#Strickland1998). 

Somewhat relatedly, the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$ and the [[p-adic complex numbers]] $\mathbf{C}_p$ are "unnaturally isomorphic". More precisely, there is no way of making constructions such as "algebraic closure of a field" or "injective hull of an $R$-module" functorial, if the desired embeddings into these constructions are to be natural, and this precludes speaking of any two such constructions as "naturally isomorphic". We touch on this again below, but see [here](#AHRT). 

## Reasons for unnaturality

Intuitively, there are several reasons that an isomorphism might fail to be natural.

* Two functors of opposite variances (one covariant and one contravariant) *cannot* be naturally isomorphic in the usual sense.  However, they can be [[dinatural transformation|dinaturally isomorphic]], so this is not really a "reason for a failure of naturality".

* In defining an isomorphism, it may be necessary to make certain arbitrary choices.  If making these choices differently would yield a different isomorphism, then usually the isomorphism will not be natural.


## Making the unnatural natural

Unnatural isomorphisms are not very well-behaved mathematically, so if we have an unnatural isomorphism we may want to "make it natural".  There are several ways to do this:

1. Use a different definition that includes more structure, such as [[derivators]] instead of [[triangulated categories]].  See for instance this [Wikipedia discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulated_category#Are_there_better_axioms.3F) on axioms for triangulated categories. 

2. Relatedly, pass to a [[higher categories|higher-categorical]] context in which a non-commuting square can commute up to a higher transformation; see [[pseudonatural transformation]] and [[lax natural transformation]].

3. Cut down to a smaller class of morphisms in the domain category for which the naturality square does commute.


## Natural, canonical, and functorial

The use of adjectives like _canonical_, _invariant_, _functorial_, _natural _ is sometimes satirized. For example, as quoted in [MO2010](#MathOverflow2010), Andr&#233; Weil writes:

> I can assure you, at any rate, that (...) my results are invariant, probably canonical, perhaps even functorial. (*Oeuvres*, vol. 2, page 558)

which may be subtly mocking. 

These three terms can be distinguished in the following way:

* The definition of a single function or operation is "canonical" if there are "no arbitrary choices" involved in it, or more precisely if the end result is independent of any arbitrary choices that we had to make in defining it.  In category theory, we generally consider something "canonical" if this independence is "up to unique isomorphism" in an appropriate sense, such as the definition of [[generalized the|the]] limit functor on a category with limits.
* The definition of a function taking the [[objects]] of a category into the objects of another is _functorial_ if we have also supplied a function on morphisms making it into a [[functor]], or more loosely if such a function exists (although in practice one always has a particular such function in mind).
* The definition of a function taking the objects of one category into morphisms of another is _natural_ if it forms a natural isomorphism between two functors (generally assumed to be given).

In particular, the adjectives "functorial" and "natural" in general apply to different  classes of things.

See [[non-canonical isomorphism]] for examples of *natural* isomorphisms that are not *canonical*.

## Examples

1. Let $U: Vect\to Aff$ be the functor taking the underlying [[affine space]] of a [[vector space]], and $D:Aff\to Vect$ the functor constructing the vector space of displacements of an affine space.  Then there is a *natural* isomorphism $D \circ U \cong Id_{Vect}$, but only an *unnatural* isomorphism "$U \circ D \cong Id_{Aff}$".  In particular, these functors do not form an [[equivalence of categories]]. A similar phenomenon occurs with [[groups]] and [[heaps]], and with [[torsors]] of groups.

1. As a particular example of the last phenomenon: there is a bijective correspondence between [[linear order|linear orderings]] of a set $S$ and [[permutations]] of $S$. Indeed, the set $Lin(S)$ is a [[torsor]] over $Perm(S)$: there is a group action $\alpha: Perm(S) \times Lin(S) \to Lin(S)$ such that for any *choice* of linear ordering $L$, the map $\alpha(-, L): Perm(S) \to Lin(S)$ is a bijection. But, there is no canonical choice of ordering $L$. 

1. [[species|Species]] are functors for which unnatural isomorphisms are sometimes discussed. For example, the species of linear orders is unnaturally isomorphic to the species of permutations; for a related example, see the commentary under this MathOverflow answer [MO2014](#GesselTrimble2014). [Yorgey2014](#Yorgey2014) explicitly uses the term: his definition 3.3.4 introduces an "equipotence between species (...) as an "unnatural" isomorphism between [the two species in question]". 

1. The term _unnatural isomorphism_ is often used in [[homological algebra]], in particular in discussions of splittings of exact sequences. An example is [Hilton-Stammbach, Theorem 4.3](#HiltonStammbach71), which explicitly uses the term to describe an isomorphism between Hom- and Ext-functors.  More generally, _unnatural transformations_ also often occur in homological algebra. 

1. It is often said that while there is an isomorphism between the [[field]] of [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$ and the completion $\mathbf{C}_p$ (with respect to the canonical absolute value) of the algebraic closure of the [[p-adic numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}_p$, this isomorphism is not natural. This statement, while somewhat loose since there are no functors specified, can be made formally precise along the lines of [Ad&#225;mek, Herrlich, Rosick&#253;, and Tholen](#AHR). The abstract reads: "In a category with injective hulls and a cogenerator, the embeddings into injective hulls can never form a natural transformation, unless all objects are injective. In particular, assigning to a field its algebraic closure, to a poset or Boolean algebra its MacNeille completion, and to an $R$-module its injective envelope is not functorial, if one wants the respective embeddings to form a natural transformation."

1. If $C$ and $D$ have only one object (or slightly more generally, one [[isomorphism class]] of objects), then any two functors $F,G:C\to D$ are unnaturally isomorphic.  For example, for any [[ring]] $R$, any two endofunctors of the category of rank-one free $R$-[[modules]] are unnaturally isomorphic.

# Measurable functions
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

The _measurable functions_ are those functions between [[measure spaces]] amenable to treatment in [[measure theory]], hence they are the evident _[[homomorphisms]]_ between [[measure spaces]].


## Definitions

Given [[measurable spaces]] $X$ and $Y$, a __measurable function__ from $X$ to $Y$ is a [[function]] $f\colon X \to Y$ such that the [[preimage]] $f^*(T)$ is [[measurable set|measurable]] in $X$ whenever $T$ is measurable in $Y$.

In classical measure theory, it is usually assumed that $Y$ is the [[real line]] (or a variation such as the extended real line or the complex plane) equipped with the [[Borel sets]].  Then $f$ is measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(I)$ is measurable whenever $I \subseteq Y$ is an interval.  More generally, if $Y$ is any [[topological space]] equipped with the Borel sets, then $f$ is measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(I)$ is measurable whenever $I \subseteq Y$ is [[open set|open]].

In some variations of measure theory based on $\delta$&#8209; or $\sigma$-rings instead of on $\sigma$-algebras, it is necessary to allow [[partial functions]] whose domain is a [[relatively measurable set]].  Classically (when $Y$ is the real line), one achieves (for purposes of [[integration]]) essentially the same result by requiring only that $f^{-1}(I)$ be measurable whenever $I \subseteq Y$ is an interval that does not contain $0$; in other words, one effectively assumes that $f$ is zero wherever it would otherwise be undefined.


## Modulo null sets

If (as in a [[measure space]], a [[Cheng space]], or a [[localisable measurable space]]), we have a notion of [[null sets]] (or [[full sets]]) in $X$ and $Y$, then we may allow a measurable function to be an __[[almost function]]__: a [[partial function]] whose domain is full.  Specifically, an almost function $f\colon X \to Y$ is __measurable__ if the [[preimage]] of every full set in $Y$ is full in $X$ and the preimage of every measurable set in $Y$ is, if not quite measurable in $X$, at least equal to a measurable set in $X$ up to a full set in $X$.  (To emphasise this last change, we may call such functions __almost measurable__.)  Additionally, we consider two measurable almost functions to be [[equal]] (or [[equivalent]] if one prefers) if they are __[[almost equality|almost equal]]__: their [[equaliser]] is full.

## Definition


An __automorphism__ of an [[object]] $x$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[isomorphism]] $f : x \to x$.  In other words, an automorphism is an [[isomorphism]] that is an [[endomorphism]].


## Automorphism group

Given an object $x$, the automorphisms of $x$ form a [[group]] under [[composition]], the __automorphism group__ of $x$, which is a submonoid of the [[endomorphism monoid]] of $x$:
$$
  Aut_C(x) = End_C(x) \cap Iso(C) = Iso_C(x,x)
,$$
which may be written $Aut(x)$ if the category $C$ is understood.  Up to equivalence, every group is an automorphism group; see [[delooping]].

## Definition

A __simply connected topological space__ is a [[n-connected space|1-connected]] [[topological space]] $X$: a [[connected space]] whose [[fundamental group]] is the [[trivial group]]:

$\pi_1(X) = \{\mathrm{e}\}$.

Equivalently: if it is a [[n-connected object of an (infinity,1)-topos|simply connected object]] of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Top]].

## Idea

A [[groupoid]] is [[connected]] if it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]] and every object is connected by a morphism to every other object.

Every [[category]] $C$ induces a groupoid $G(C)$ by freely inverting all its [[morphism]]s. A category is connected if the groupoid $G(C)$ is.


## Definition

A [[category]] $C$ is **connected** if it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]] and the following equivalent conditions hold

* any two [[objects]] can be connected by a [[zigzag]] of [[morphisms]].

* the $\infty$-groupoidification of the category (the [[Kan fibrant replacement]] of its [[nerve]]) is a [[connected]] [[∞-groupoid]].

* the [[geometric realization]] of its [[nerve]] is a [[connected topological space]].

* the [[localization]] $C[C_1^{-1}]$ of $C$ at all its morphisms is a connected groupoid.

Note that the [[empty category]] is not connected.  For other purposes, one can argue about whether the [[empty set]] should be called "connected" (see [[connected space]]), but for the applications of connected categories, the empty category should definitely not be called connected.  In particular, a [[terminal object]] is not a [[connected limit]].

# Paths
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definitions

In [[topology]], a (parametrised, oriented) __path__ in a [[space]] $X$ is a map (a [[morphism]] in an appropriate [[category]] of [[spaces]], such as a [[continuous function]] between [[topological space]]) to $X$ from the [[topological interval]] $\mathbb{I} = [0,1]$.  

A __path from $a$ to $b$__ is a path $f$ such that $f(0) = a$ and $f(1) = b$.  
An __unparametrised path__ is an [[equivalence class]] of paths, such that $f$ and $g$ are equivalent if there is an [[monotone function|increasing]] [[automorphism]] $\phi$ of $\mathbb{I}$ such that $g = f \circ \phi$.  An __unoriented path__ is an equivalence class of paths such that $f$ is equivalent to $(x \mapsto f(1 - x))$.  

If $P$ is a path, then its __reverse path__[^1], denoted $\overline{P}$, is defined to be the composite $P \circ ( t\mapsto 1-t )$. 
The operation $P\mapsto\overline{P}$ is called _path reversal_.

[^1]: Cf. e.g. [[Introduction to Topology -- 2]], or also [Section 2.1](#tomDieck2008); beware that that reference, (0) like many others, uses the term "inverse path", even though the operation of concatenation of paths does not *in and of itself* yield a [[strict category|strict groupoid]], in which $\overline{P}$ would be an inverse, and (1) that it uses $a$ and $b$ for the endpoints of the _interval_, not the endpoints of the paths in the space $X$, and (2) that it uses $P^-$ instead of $\overline{P}$, which however is less suited for notational iterating (compare $\overline{\overline{P}}=P$ with $(P^-)^-=P$), and that (3)  the 2008 edition has a typo: " $w(1-t)$ " in loc. cit., when   *inverse path* gets defined, should be $u(1-t)$.

A __Moore path__ is defined like a path, except for having another domain: replace $[0,1]$ with the interval $[0,n]$ for some [[natural number]] (or, more commonly, any non-negative [[real number]]) $n$.  All of these variations can be combined, of course.  (For unoriented paths, one usually says 'between $a$ and $b$' instead of 'from $a$ to $b$'.  Also, a Moore path from $a$ to $b$ has $f(n) = b$ instead of $f(1) = b$.  Finally, there is not much difference between unparametrised paths and unparametrised Moore paths, since we may interpret $(t \mapsto n t)$ as a reparametrisation $\phi$.)

In [[graph theory]], a __path__ is a [[list]] of edges, each of which ends where the next begins.  Actually, this is a special case of the above, if we use Moore paths and interpret $[0,n]$ as the linear graph with $n + 1$ vertices and $n$ edges; in this way, the other variations become meaningful.  (However, as the only directed graph automorphism of $[0,n]$ is the [[identity morphism|identity]], parametrisation is trivial for directed graphs and equivalent to orientation for undirected graphs.  Note that a non-Moore path is simply an edge, one of the fundamental ingredients of a graph.)


## Concatenation

Given a Moore path $f$ from $a$ to $b$ and a Moore path $g$ from $b$ to $c$, the __concatenation__ of $f$ and $g$ is a Moore path $f ; g$ or $g \circ f$ from $a$ to $c$.  If the domain of $f$ is $[0,m]$ and the domain of $g$ is $[0,n]$, then the domain of $f ; g$ is $[0,m+n]$, and
$$ (f ; g)(x) \coloneqq \left \{ \array { f(x) & \quad x \leq m \\ g(x-m) & \quad x \geq m .} \right . $$
In this way, we get a ([[strict category|strict]]) [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[global element|points]] in $X$ and whose [[morphisms]] are Moore paths in $X$, with concatenation as [[composition]].  This category is called the __[[Moore path category]]__.

Often we are more interested in a [[quotient category]] of the Moore path category.  If we use unparametrised paths (in which case we may use paths with domain $\mathbb{I}$ if we wish), then we get the __unparametrised [[path category]]__.  If $X$ is a [[smooth space]], then we may additionally identify paths related through a [[thin homotopy]] to get the __[[path groupoid]]__.  Finally, if $X$ is a [[continuous space]] and we identify paths related through any (endpoint-preserving) [[homotopy]], then we get the __[[fundamental groupoid]]__ of $X$.

In graph theory, the Moore path category is known as the __[[free category]]__ on the graph.

## Idea

In [[linear algebra]] a _projector_ is a [[linear map]] $e \colon V \to V$ that "squares to itself" in that its [[composition]] with itself is again itself: $e \circ e = e$. 

A projector $e$ leads to a decomposition of the [[vector space]] $V$ that it acts on into a [[direct sum]] of its [[kernel]] and its [[image]]:

$$
  V \simeq ker(e) \oplus im(e)
  \,.
$$

The notion of projector is the special case of that of [[idempotent]] [[morphism]].

In [[functional analysis]], one sometimes requires additionally that this idempotent is in fact [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]]; or one can use the slightly different terminology __projection operator__.


## Properties

Projectors relate to the notion of [[projections]] in [[category theory]] as follows: the existence of the projector $P \colon V \to V$ canonically induces a decomposition of $V$ as a [[direct sum]] $V \simeq ker(V) \oplus im(V)$ and in terms of this $P$ is the [[composition]]

$$
  P \colon V \simeq im(v) \oplus ker(V)\to im(V) \hookrightarrow V
$$

of the [[projection]] (in the sense of maps out of [[products]]) out of the [[direct sum]] $im(V) \oplus ker(V) \simeq im(V) \times ker(V)$ followed by the [[subobject]] inclusion of $im(V)$. Hence: 

_A projector is a projection followed by an inclusion_.

\section{Idea}
 {#Idea}

Where a _[[group]]_ may be thought of as a _group of symmetry transformations_ that [[isomorphism|isomorphically]] relates one [[object]] to itself (the _[[symmetries]]_ of one object, such as the [[isometries]] of a [[polyhedron]]) a _groupoid_ is a collection of symmetry transformations acting between possibly more than one object.


Hence a groupoid consists of a [[set]] of objects $x, y, z, \cdots$ and for each [[pair]] of objects $(x,y)$ there is a set of transformations, usually denoted by arrows

$$
  x \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} y
$$

which may be composed if they are composable (i.e. if the first ends where the second starts)

$$
  \array{
    && y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    x && \underset{g \circ f}{\longrightarrow}  && z
  }
$$

such that this composition is [[associativity|associative]] 

\begin{imagefromfile}
  "file_name": "AssociativityDiagram.png",
  "width": 400
\end{imagefromfile}

and such that for each object $x$ there is identity transformation $x \overset{id_X}{\longrightarrow} x$ in that this is a [[neutral element]] for the composition of transformations, whenever defined.

So far this structure is what is called a _[[small category]]_. What makes this a _([[small groupoid|small]]) groupoid_ is that all these transformations are to be "symmetries" in that they are [[invertible morphisms]] meaning that for each transformation $x \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} y$ there is a transformation the other way around $y \overset{f^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} x$ such that

$$
  f^{-1} \circ f  = id_x
  \phantom{AAAA}
  f \circ f^{-1} = id_y
  \,.
$$

If there is only a single object $x$, then this definition reduces to that of a [[group]], and in this sense groupoids are "groups with many objects". Conversely, given any groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ and a choice of one of its objects $x$, then the subcollection of transformations from and to $x$ is a group, sometimes called the [[automorphism group]] $Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(x)$ of $x$ in $\mathcal{G}$.

Just as for groups, the "transformations" above need not necessarily be given by concrete transformations (say by [[bijections]] between [[objects]] which are [[sets]]). Just as for groups, such a concrete realization is always possible, but is an extra choice (called a [[representation]] of the groupoid). Generally one calls these "transformations" _[[morphisms]]_: $x \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} y$ is a morphism with "[[source]]" $x$ and "[[domain]]" $y$.

An archetypical example of a groupoid is the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ of a [[topological space]]
(def. \ref{FundamentalGroupoid} below, for introduction see [here](Introduction+to+Topology+--+2#Homotopy)): For $X$ a topological space, this is the groupoid whose

* [[objects]] are the points $x \in X$;

* [[morphisms]]  $x \overset{[\gamma]}{\longrightarrow} y$ are the [[homotopy relative boundary]]-[[equivalence classes]] $[\gamma]$ of [[paths]] $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ in $X$, with $\gamma(0) = x$ and $\gamma(1) = y$;

and [[composition]] is given, on representatives, by [[concatenation]] of paths. Here the class of the [[reverse path]] $\bar\gamma \;\colon\; t \mapsto \gamma(1-t)$ constitutes the inverse morphism, making this a groupoid.

If one _chooses_ a point $x \in X$, then the corresponding group at that point is the _[[fundamental group]]_ $\pi_1(X,x) \coloneqq Aut_{\Pi_1(X)}(x)$ of $X$ at that point.

This highlights one of the reasons for being interested in groupoids over groups: Sometimes this allows to avoid unnatural ad-hoc choices and it serves to streamline and simplify the theory.

A [[homomorphism]] between groupoids is the obvious: a [[function]] between their underlying [[objects]] together with a function between their morphisms which respects [[source]] and [[target]] objects as well as [[composition]] and [[identity morphisms]]. If one thinks of the groupoid as a special case of a [[category]], then this is a _[[functor]]_. Between groupoids with only a single object this is the same as a [[group homomorphism]].

For example if $f \;\colon\; X \to Y$ is a [[continuous function]] between topological spaces, then postcomposition of [[paths]] with this function induces a groupoid homomorphism $f_\ast \;\colon\; \Pi_1(X) \longrightarrow \Pi_1(Y)$ between the [[fundamental groupoids]] from above.

Groupoids with groupoid homomorphisms ([[functors]]) between them form a [[category]] [[Grpd]] (def. \ref{1CategoryOfGroupoids} below) which includes the categeory [[Grp]] of [[groups]] as the [[full subcategory]] of the groupoids with a single object. This makes precise how groupoid theory is a generalization of [[group theory]].

However, for groupoids more than for groups one is typically interested in "[[conjugation actions]]" on homomorphisms. These are richer for groupoids than for groups, because one may conjugate with a different morphism at each object. If we think of groupoids as special cases of [[categories]], then these "conjugation actions on homomorphisms" are _[[natural transformations]]_ between [[functors]].

For examples if $f,g \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ are two [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]], and if $\eta \;\colon\; f \Rightarrow g$ is a [[homotopy]] from $f$ to $g$, then the [[homotopy relative boundary]] classes of the [[paths]] $\eta(x,-) \;\colon\; [0,1] \to Y$ constitute a natural transformation between $f_*, g_\ast \;\colon\; \Pi_1(X) \to \Pi_1(Y) $ in that for all paths $x_1 \overset{[\gamma]}{\longrightarrow} x_2$ in $X$ we have the "conjugation relation"

$$
  [\eta(x_1,-)] \cdot [f\circ\gamma]
  =
  [g \circ \gamma] \cdot [\eta(x_2,-)]
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \text{i.e.}
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \array{
    f(x_1) &\overset{[\eta(x_1,-)]}{\longrightarrow}& g(x_1)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{[f \circ \gamma]}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[g \circ \gamma]}}
    \\
    f(x_2) &\underset{[\eta(x_2,-)]}{\longrightarrow}& g(x_2)
  }
  \,.
$$

One may take care of the existence of these conjugation actions/natural transformation in two ways:

1. If one quotients them out, i.e. if one identifies two groupoid homomorphisms that differ by a conjugation action, then the resulting [[category]] of groupoids and classes of homomorphisms is called the _[[homotopy category]]_ $Ho(Grpd)$ of [[Grpd]] (def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfGroupoids} below). This is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[full subcategory]] of the [[classical homotopy category]] of [[topological spaces]] on those that are ([[CW-complexes]] and) [[homotopy 1-types]], i.e. those for which the [[fundamental groupoid]] is the _only_ homotopy invariant, with all higher [[homotopy groups]] being trivial:

   $$
     Ho(Grpd) \simeq Ho(Top^{CW}_{\leq 1}) \hookrightarrow Ho(Top^{CW})
     \,.
   $$

   This means that the concept of groupoids may be regarded as a combinatorial model for [[homotopy 1-types]] in [[homotopy theory]], in contrast to the models by [[topological spaces]] given by [[topological homotopy theory]]. This equivalence generalizes to [[homotopy n-types]] as one passes to [[n-groupoids]] and eventually to all [[homotopy types]] as one passes to [[infinity-groupoids]].

1. Instead of forgetting all the information encoded in the conjugations/natural transformations, one may also collect it all into the structure of a [[2-category]] [[Grpd]] (in fact a [[(2,1)-category]]). As such this is the sub-2-category of [[Cat]] on those (small) categories all whose morphisms are [[invertible morphism]].

For more introduction on this see at _[[geometry of physics -- homotopy types]]_.

In either of these two cases, beware that the category [[Grp]] of [[groups]] is _not_ a [[full subcategory]] either of the [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Grpd)$ or of the [[(2,1)-category]] [[Grpd]], because conjugation action is is not part of the definition of $Grp$. Instead in [[homotopy theory]] it is _[[pointed object|pointed]]_ one-object groupoids which are equivalent to groups

$$
  Grp \hookrightarrow Grpd^{\ast/}
  \,.
$$

(Even though there is a unique choice of point for a one-object groupoid, the respect for this (unique) choice forces the conjugation actions on groupoids to be trivial. ) This simple statement is in fact a special case of the [[May recognition theorem]] (see [there](Ek-Algebras#MainResult)) which holds for more general [[homotopy types]] and even for [[directed homotopy types]].

The equivalence of groupoids with [[homotopy 1-types]] shows immediately that, with [[homotopy]] taken into accont, the difference between groupoids and groups is rather mild, after all: Every [[groupoid]] is [[equivalence of groupoids|equivalent]] ([[isomorphism|isomorphic]] in $Ho(Grpd)$) to a [[disjoint union]] of groupoids with a single object (prop. \ref{EveryGroupoidIsEquivalentToDisjointUnionOfGroupDeloopings} below). In particular [[groupoid representations]] are equivalently just tuples of [[group representations]] (prop. \ref{GroupoidRepresentationsAreProductsOfGroupRepresentations} below.) This is the reason why the competition between [[general topology]] textbooks that do and that do not prefer the [[fundamental groupoid]] over the [[fundamental group]] remains inconclusive.

However, this equivalence of groupoids with disjoint unions of groups depends on the [[axiom of choice]]. Even if this is assumed in the underlying [[foundations]]/[[set theory]], it breaks once one considers groupoids equipped with geometric structure:

Just as one may consider [[topological groups]] and [[Lie groups]], etc., there are the evident concepts of [[topological groupoids]] and [[Lie groupoids]] etc. (generally: _[[internal  groupoids]]_). Their theory turns out to be genuinely richer than that of their group analogs, due to the interaction between the [[geometry]] and the [[homotopy theory]] ("[[higher geometry]]").

The correct concept of homomorphisms between [[Lie groupoids]] for instance goes by many names, including _[[Morita morphisms]]_, _[[Hilsum-Skandalis morphisms]]_ and _[[bibundles]]_. The general way to understand this and all other geometric groupoid theory is via the concept of _[[stacks]] of groupoids_. For more pointers on this see at _[[higher geometry]]_ and for introduction in the case of [[higher differential geometry]] see at _[[geometry of physics -- smooth homotopy types]]_.

For $\mathcal{G}_1, \mathcal{G}_2$  two groupoids and $F, G, H \colon \mathcal{G}_1  \longrightarrow \mathcal{G}_2$
three functors between them and $\eta_1 \;\colon\; F \Rightarrow G$ and $\eta_2 \;\colon\; G \Rightarrow H$
conjugation actions/natural isomorphisms between these, there is the composite

with components the composite of the components

whose objects are the groupoid homomorphisms / functors, and whose morphisms are the conjugation actions / natural transformations.

###### Remark
**(Higher groupoid theory vs higher category theory)**
Due to the two preceding remarks, groupoid theory may be regarded as a special case of [[dagger category theory]] or [[category theory]], it
is noteworthy that the two theories are quite different in character. For example [[higher groupoid]]
theory is _[[homotopy theory]]_ which is rich but quite tractable, for instance via tools
such as [[simplicial homotopy theory]] or [[homotopy type theory]], while [[higher category theory]] and higher dagger category theory
is intricate and becomes tractable mostly by making recourse to higher groupoid theory in the guise of
[[(infinity,1)-category theory]] and [[(infinity,n)-categories]].

###### Definition
**(groupoid -- global definition)**

A _[[small groupoid]]_ $\mathcal{G}$ is

1. a [[set]] $G_0$ called its _set of [[objects]]_;

1. a [[set]] $G_1$ called its _set of [[morphisms]]_ or _set of arrows_

1. a [[pair]] of [[functions]]

   $$
     s, t \;\colon\; G_1 \rightrightarrows G_0
   $$

   called _[[source]]_ and _[[target]]_ or _[[domain]]_ and _[[codomain]]_

   (an element $g\in G_1$ is denoted by $s(g) \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} t(g)$);

1. a multiplication or _[[composition]]_ map $m \colon G_1 \times_{s, G_0, t} G_1 \to G_1$, usually denoted as $g h$ for $m(g,h)$, which satisfies

   1. $s(g h)=s(h)$, $t(g h)=t(g)$, and

   1. [[associativity]]: $(g h)k=g(h k)$,

   1. identity section: $e: G_0\to G_1$, such that $e(t(g))g=g=ge(s(g))$ (in particular, $s\circ e= t \circ e$),

   1. [[inverse]], $i: G_1 \to G_1$, also denoted by $i(g)=g^{-1}$, such that for all $g\in G$,

      $ g^{-1} g = e(s(g)), \quad g g^{-1} = e(t(g)). $

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(Notation and Terminology)**

If $x,y$ are [[objects]] (also called [[vertices]]) of the groupoid $G$ then the set of [[morphisms]] (also called arrows) from $x$ to $y$ is written $G(x,y)$, or other notations for [[hom-sets]].  The set $G(x,x)$ (which is a [[group]] under composition) is also written $G(x)$ and called the _vertex group_ of $G$ at $x$.  It is also written $Aut_G(x)$ and called the [[automorphism group]] of $x$ in $G$, or written $\pi_1(G,x)$ and called the [[fundamental group]] of $G$ at $x$ (especially if you think of a groupoid as giving a [[homotopy 1-type]]).

As in any [[category]], there is a question of notation for the [[composition]], and in particular of the order in which to write things. It can be more convenient to write the composition of $a:x \to y$ and $b: y \to z$ as $a b:x \to z$, although a more traditional notation would be $b a$.  The two conventions can be distinguished by writing $a; b$ or $b\circ a$ (which is the most traditional notation for categories).  See [[composition]] for further discussion.

A groupoid $G$ is _[[connected groupoid|connected]]_, or _[[transitive groupoid|transitive]]_, if $G(x,y)$ is nonempty for all $x,y \in Ob(G)$; it is called _[[inhabited groupoid|inhabited]]_, or _nonempty_, if it has at least one object. A [[maximal element|maximal]] inhabited connected [[subgroupoid]] of $G$ is called a _component_ of $G$, and $G$ is then the [[disjoint union]] (the [[coproduct]] in $\Grpd$) of its connected components. The set of components of $G$ is written $\pi_0(G)$ (especially if you think of a groupoid as giving a [[homotopy 1-type]]).

+-- {: .num_prop #1CategoryOfGroupoids}
###### Remark
**([[1-category]] of [[groupoids]])**

From def. \ref{GroupoidDependentlyTypes} we see that there
is a [[category]] whose

* [[objects]] are the small groupoids;

* [[morphisms]] are the groupoid homomorphisms ([[functors]]).

=--

But since this [[1-category]] does not reflect the existence of [[homotopies]]/[[natural isomorphisms]]
between homomorphsims/[[functors]] of groupoids (def. \ref{GroupoidDependentlyTypes})
this [[1-category]] is not what one is interested in when considering [[homotopy theory]]/[[higher category theory]].

In order to obtain the right notion of category of groupoids
that does reflect homotopies, we first consider now the _horizontal_ composition of homotopies/natural transformations.

+-- {: .num_lemma #HmotopiesWithMorphismsHorizontaComposition}

$$
  \mathcal{G}_1
    \overset{F_1}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{G}_2
    \underoverset
      {\underset{\phantom{AA}F_2\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}}

be morphisms and a homotopy $\eta$. Then there is a homotopy

$$
  \mathcal{G}_1
  \phantom{AAAA}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{F_3 \circ F_2\circ F_1}{\longrightarrow}}

between the respective composites, with components given by

$$
  (F_3 \cdot \eta \cdot F_1)(x)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  F_3(\eta(F_1(x)))
  \,.
$$

This operation constitutes a groupoid homomorphism/functor

$$
  F_3\cdot (-)\cdot F_1
    \;\colon\;

$$

###### Proof

The respect for identities is clear. To see the respect for composition, let

$$
  \mathcal{G}_2
  \array{
     \overset{F}{\longrightarrow}
     \\
     \Downarrow \eta_1
     \\
     \overset{G}{\longrightarrow}
     \\
     \Downarrow \eta_2
     \\
     \underset{H}{\longrightarrow}
  }
  \mathcal{G}_3
$$

be two composable homotopies. We need to show that

$$
  F_3 \cdot (\eta_2 \circ \eta_1) \cdot F_1
  =
  ( F_3 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot F_1 ) \circ ( F_3 \cdot \eta_1 \cdot F_1 )
  \,.
$$

Now for $x$ any object of $\mathcal{G}_1$ we find

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (F_3 \cdot (\eta_2 \circ \eta_1) \cdot F_1)(x)
      & \coloneqq
    F_2((\eta_2 \circ \eta_1)(F_1(X)))
      \\
      & \coloneqq
   F_3( \eta_2(F_1(x)) \circ \eta_1 (F_1(x)))
     \\
     &=
    F_2( \eta_2(F_1(x)) ) \circ F_2( \eta_1(F_1(X)) )
      \\
     & =
    (( F_3 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot F_1 ) \circ ( F_3 \cdot \eta_1 \cdot F_1 ))(x)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here all steps are unwinding of the definition of horizontal and of ordinary (vertical)
composition of homotopies, except the third equality, which is the functoriality of $F_2$.

**([[horizontal composition]] of [[homotopies]])

Consider a [[diagram]] of [[groupoids]], groupoid homomorphsims (functors) and homotopies (natural transformations) as follows:

$$

       {\overset{F_2\circ F_1}{\longrightarrow}}

  \mathcal{G}_3
$$

may be defined in temrs of the horizontal composition of homotopies with morphisms (lemma \ref{HmotopiesWithMorphismsHorizontaComposition}) and the ("vertical") composition of homotopies with themselves, in two different ways, namely by decomposing the above diagram as


$$
  \array{

    \underoverset
       {\underset{\phantom{AA}F'_1\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}}

$$

or as

$$
  \array{

       {\underset{\phantom{AA}F'_2\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}}
       {}
       {}
  \mathcal{G}_3
  }
$$

In the first case we get

$$
  \eta_2 \cdot \eta_1
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (\eta_2 \cdot F'_1) \circ (F_2 \cdot \eta_1)
$$

while in the second case we get

$$
  \eta_2 \cdot \eta_1
   \;\coloneqq\;
   ( F'_2 \cdot \eta_1 ) \circ (\eta_2 \cdot F_1)
  \,.
$$

These two definitions coincide.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $x$ an object of $\mathcal{G}_1$, then we need that the following square [[diagram]] [[commuting diagram|commutes]] in $\mathcal{G}_3$

$$
  \array{
    F_2(F_1(x))
      &\overset{ (F_2\cdot \eta_1)(x) }{\longrightarrow}& F_2(F'_1(x))
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{ (\eta_2 \cdot F_1)(x) }}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ (\eta_2\cdot F'_1)(x) }}
    \\
    F'_2(F_1(x))
      & \underset{ (F'_2 \cdot \eta_1)(x) }{\longrightarrow} &
    F'_2(F'_1(y))
  }
   \phantom{AAAA} = \phantom{AAAA}
  \array{
    F_2(F_1(x)) &\overset{F_2(\eta_1(x))}{\longrightarrow}& F_2(F'_1(x))

    F'_2(F_1(x))
      & \underset{F'_2(\eta_1(x))}{\longrightarrow} &
    F'_2(F'_1(y))
  }
  \,.
$$

But the ommutativity of the square on the right is the defining compatibility condition on the components of $\eta_2$ applied to the morphism $\eta_1(x)$ in $\mathcal{G}_2$.

###### Definition
**([[groupoid representation]])

Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a [[groupoid]]. Then:

A [[linear representation]] of $\mathcal{G}$ is a groupoid homomorphism ([[functor]])

$$
  \rho \;\colon\; \mathcal{G} \longrightarrow Core(Vect)
$$

to the groupoid [[core]] of the category [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]] (example \ref{CoreGroupoid}). Hence this is

1. For each object $x$ of $\mathcal{G}$ a [[vector space]] $V_x$;

1. for each morphism $x \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} y$ of $\mathcal{G}$ a
   [[linear map]] $\rho(f) \;\colon\; V_x \to V_y$

such that

1. (respect for composition) for all composable morphisms $x \overset{f}{\to}y \overset{g}{\to} z$ in the
   groupoid we have an [[equality]]

   $$
     \rho(g) \circ \rho(f) = \rho(g \circ f)
   $$

1. (respect for identities) for each object $x$ of the groupoid we have an equality

   $$
     \rho(id_x) = id_{V_x}
     \,.
   $$

Similarly a _[[permutation representation]]_ of $\mathcal{G}$ is a groupoid homomorphism ([[functor]])

$$
  \rho \;\colon\; \mathcal{G} \longrightarrow Core(Set)
$$

to the groupoid core of [[Set]]. Hence this is

1. For each object $x$ of $\mathcal{G}$ a [[set]] $S_x$;

1. for each morphism $x \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} y$ of $\mathcal{G}$ a
   [[function]] $\rho(f) \;\colon\; S_x \to S_y$

such that composition and identities are respected, as above.

For $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ two such representations, then a homomorphism of representations

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \rho_1 \longrightarrow \rho_2
$$

is a [[natural transformation]] between these functors, hence is

* for each object $x$ of the groupoid a (linear) function

  $$
    (V_1)_x \overset{\phi(x)}{\longrightarrow} (V_2)_x
  $$

* such that for all morphisms $x \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} y$
  we have

  $$
    \phi(y) \circ \rho_1(f) = \rho_2(x) \circ \phi(x)
    \phantom{AAAAAA}
    \array{
      (V_1)_x &\overset{\phi(x)}{\longrightarrow}& (V_2)_x

      \\
      (V_1)_y &\underset{\phi(y)}{\longrightarrow}& (V_2)_y
    }

Representations of $\mathcal{G}$ and homomorphisms between them constitute a [[category]],
called the [[representation category]] $Rep_{Grpd}(\mathcal{G})$.

\section{Examples}


+-- {: .num_example #FundamentalGroupoid}
###### Example
**([[fundamental groupoid]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. For $x,y \in X$ two points, write $P_{x,y}X$
for the set of [[paths]] in $X$ from $x$ to $y$. Consider the [[equivalence relation]]
"[[homotopy relative boundary]]" on this set and write

$$
  Hom(x,y) \coloneqq (P_{x,y}X)/\simeq
$$

for the set of [[equivalence classes]] under this relation. The [[concatenation of paths]]
descends to these equivalence classes. This yields a groupoid with set of objects the set $X$
of points in the topological space. This is the called the _[[fundamental groupoid]]_ $\Pi_1(X)$
of $X$.

This construction extends to a [[functor]]

$$
   \Pi_1 \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Grpd_1
$$

from the [[1-category]] [[Top]] to the [[1-category]] [[Grpd]]. In fact it extends to a functor

$$
  \Pi_1 \;\colon\; Ho(Top) \longrightarrow Ho(Grpd)
$$

on [[homotopy categories]].


=--



+-- {: .num_example #FundamentalGroupoid2Functor}
###### Example
**([[(2,1)-functor|(2,1)-functoriality]] of [[fundamental groupoid]])

If $X$ and $Y$ are [[topological spaces]] and $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$
is a [[continuous function]] between them, then this induces a groupoid homomorphism (functor)
between the respective [[fundamental groupoids]] (def. \ref{FundamentalGroupoid})

$$
  F_f \;\colon\; \Pi_1(X) \longrightarrow \Pi_1(Y)
$$

given on objects by the underlying function of $f$

$$
  (F_f)_0 \coloneqq f
$$

and given on the class of a [[path]] by the evident postcomposition with $f$

$$
  (F_f)_{x,y}
    \;\colon\;
  (x \overset{[\gamma]}{\longrightarrow} y)
    \;\mapsto\;
  (f(x) \overset{[f \circ \gamma]}{\longrightarrow} f(y) )
  \,.
$$

This construction clearly respects [[identity morphisms]] and [[composition]] and hence is
itself a [[functor]] of the form

$$
  \Pi_1 \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Grpd_1
$$

from the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological  space]] to the [[1-category]] [[Grpd]] of groupoids.

But more is true: If $f,g \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ are two [[continuous function]] and

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; f \Rightarrow g
$$

is a [[left homotopy]] between them, hence a continuous function

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; X \times [0,1] \longrightarrow Y
$$

such that $\eta(-,0) = f$ and $\eta(-,1) = g$, then this induces a homotopy between the above groupoid homomorphisms
(a natural transformation of functors).

This shows that the fundamental groupoid functor in fact descends to [[homotopy categories]]

$$
  \Pi_1 \;\colon\; Ho(Top) \longrightarrow Ho(Grpd)
  \,.
$$

(In fact this means it even extends to a [[(2,1)-functor]] from the [[(2,1)-category]]
of topological spaces, continuous functions, and [[higher homotopy]]-classes of left homotopues,
to that of groupoids.)

As a direct consequence it follows that if there is a [[homotopy equivalence]]

$$

$$

between [[topological spaces]], then there is an induced [[equivalence of groupoids]]
betwee their [[fundamental groupoids]]

$$
  \Pi_1(X) \simeq \Pi_1(Y)
  \,.
$$

Hence the [[fundamental groupoid]] is a _[[homotopy invariant]]_ of topological spaces.
Of course by prop. \ref{DeloopingGroupoidEquivalence} the fundamental groupoid is
equivalent, as a groupoid, to the disjoint union of the [[deloopings]] of
all the [[fundamental groups]] of the given topological spaces, one for each [[connected component]],
and hence this is equivalently the statement that the set of connected components
and the fundamental groups of a topological space are homotopy invariants.

For $X$ any set, there is the _[[discrete groupoid]]_ $Disc(X)$, whose set of objects

+-- {: .num_example #GroupoidFromDelooping}
###### Example
**([[delooping]] of a  [[group]])**

Let $G$ be a [[group]]. Then there is a groupoid, denoted $B G$, with a single object $p$, with morphisms

$$
  Hom_{B G}(p,p) \coloneqq G
$$

the elements of $G$, with composition the multiplication in $G$, with identity morphism the [[neutral element]] in $G$ and with inverse morphisms the inverse elements in $G$.

This is also called the _[[delooping]]_ of $G$ (because the [[loop space object]] of $B G$ at the unique point is the given group:
$\Omega B G \simeq G$).

For $G_1, G_2$ two groups, then there is a [[natural bijection]] between [[group homomorphisms]]
$\phi \colon G_1 \to G_2$ and groupoid homomorphisms $B_ G_1 \to B_ G_2$: the latter are all of the form
$B \phi$, with $(B \phi)_0$ uniquely fixed and $(B \phi)_{p,p} = \phi$.

This means that the construction $B(-)$ is a  [[fully faithful functor]]

$$
  B(-) \;\colon\; Grp \hookrightarrow Grpd_1
$$

into from the category [[Grp]] of groups to the [[1-category]] of [[groupoids]].

But beware that this functor is not fully faithful when homotopies of groupoids are taken into acount,
because there are in general non-trivial homotopies between morphims of the form

$$
  B \phi_1, B \phi_2
  \;\colon\;
  B G \longrightarrow B H
$$

By definition, such a homotopy (natural transformation) $\eta \;\colon\; B \phi_1 \Rightarrow B \phi_2$
is a choice of a single elemet $\eta_p \in H$ such that for all $g \in G$
we have

$$
  \phi_2(g) = h \cdot \phi_1(g) \cdot h^{-1}
  \phantom{AAAAAAAAA}
  \array{
    p &\overset{h}{\longrightarrow}& p
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\phi_1(g)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi_2(g)}}
    \\
    p &\underset{h}{\longrightarrow}& p
  }
$$

hence such that

$$
  \phi_2 = Ad_h \circ \phi_1
  \,.
$$

Therefore notably the induced functor

$$
  B(-) \;\colon\; Grp \longrightarrow Ho(Grp)
$$

to the [[homotopy category]] of groupoids is not fully faithful.

But since $B G$ is canonically a [[pointed object]] in groupoids, we may also regard [[delooping]]
as a functor

$$
  B(-) \;\colon\; Grp \longrightarrow Grpd^{\ast/}
$$

to the [[category of pointed objects]] of [[Grpd]]. Since groupoid homomorphisms $B G_1 \to B G_2$
necessarily preserve the basepoint, this makes no difference at this point. But as we now
pass to the [[homotopy category]]

$$
  B(-) \;\colon\; Grp \hookrightarrow Ho(Grpd^{\ast/})
$$

then also the homotopies are required to preserve the basepoint, and for
homotopies between homomorphisms between delooped groups this means, since there only
is a single point, that these homotopies are all trivial. Hence regarded this way
the functor is a [[fully faithful functor]] again, hence an [[equivalence of categories]]
onto its [[essential image]]. By prop. \ref{EveryGroupoidIsEquivalentToDisjointUnionOfGroupDeloopings} below
this essential image consists precisely of the (pointed) [[connected object|connected]] groupoids:

_Groups are equivalently pointed connected groupoids_.

3. From any [[group action|action]] of a [[group]] $H$ on a [[set]] $X$ we obtain an [[action groupoid]] or "[[weak quotient]]" $X/ \!\! /H$. This is also written $X \rtimes H$, a semidirect product, since it is a special case of the semidirect product of an action of a groupoid on a groupoid.  If $X=\{*\}$ this gives the groupoid $\mathbf{B}H$, above.

4. A [[symmetric proset]], that is a set $X$ equipped with an [[equivalence relation]] $E$, becomes a groupoid with the multiplication $(x,y);(y,z) = (x,z)$ for all $(x,y), (y,z) \in E$.  (This gives one reason for the forward notation for composition.)  Such a groupoid is equivalent to the [[discrete category]] on the [[quotient set]] $X/E$.

5. In particular, if $E$ is the universal relation $X \times X$, then we get the _[[square groupoid]]_ $X^2$, also called the _[[trivial groupoid]]_ on $X$. Despite the latter name, there is an important special case, namely the groupoid $I= \{0,1\}^2$. This groupoid has non-identity elements $\iota:0 \to 1, \iota^{-1}: 1 \to 0$, and can be regarded as a groupoid model of the unit [[interval]] $[0,1]$ in [[topology]].

6. More generally, if we choose some [[subset]] $S$ of the points of a space $X$, then we have a [[full subcategory|full subgroupoid]] of $\pi_1(X)$ containing only those points in $S$, denoted $\pi_1(X,S)$.  This can result in much more manageable groupoids; for instance $\Pi_1([0,1],\{0,1\})$ is the groupoid $I$ considered above, while $\Pi_1([0,1])$ has [[uncountable set|uncountably]] many objects (but is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $I$).

7. If $\Gamma$ is a [[directed graph]] or [[quiver]], then the _[[free groupoid]]_ $F(\Gamma)$ is well defined. It is the left [[adjoint functor]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from groupoids to directed graphs. This shows an advantage of groupoids: the notion of _free equivalence relation_ or _free action groupoid_ does not easily make sense. But we can still talk of a presentation of an equivalence relation or action groupoid by [[generators and relations]], by considering presentations of groupoids instead.

8. A [paper by &#381;ivaljevi&#263;](#Zivaljevic) gives examples of groupoids used in combinatorics.

9. The book "Topology and Groupoids" listed below takes the view that 1-dimensional homotopy theory, including the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem, the theory of covering spaces, and the less well known theory of the fundamental group(oid) of an orbit space by a discontinuous group action, is best presented using the notion of groupoid rather than group as basic. This had led in the 1960s to the question of the prospective use of (strict) groupoids in higher homotopy theory. One answer is given in the book _[[Nonabelian algebraic topology]]_.

1. $F$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] (def. \ref{GroupoidWeakHomotopyEquivalence}).

The implication 2) $\Rightarrow 1)$ is immediate.

In the other direction, assume that $F$ is an equivalence of groupoids, and let $G$ be an inverse up to natural isomorphism.
It is clear that both induces bijections on connected components. To see that both are isomorphisms
of automorphisms groups, observe that the conditions for the natural isomorphisms

$$
  \alpha \;\colon\; G \circ F \Rightarrow id

since there is only a single object. But this means $F_{i,i}$ and $F_{j,j}$ are group isomorphisms.

###### Proposition
**(every [[groupoid]] is [[equivalence of groupoids|equivalent]] to a [[disjoint union]] of [[group]] [[deloopings]])

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], then:

For $\mathcal{G}$ any [[groupoid]], then there exists a [[set]] $\{G_i\}_{i \in I}$ of groups and an [[equivalence of groupoids]] (def. \ref{EquivalenceOfGroupoids})

$$
  \mathcal{G} \simeq \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} B G_i
$$

between $\mathcal{G}$ and a [[disjoint union]] of [[delooping groupoids]] (example \ref{DeloopingGroupoidDisjointUnion}).
This is called a _[[skeleton]]_ of $\mathcal{G}$.

Concretely, this exists for $I = \pi_0(\mathcal{G})$ the set of [[connected components]] of $\mathcal{G}$ (def. \ref{GroupoidConnectedComponents}) and for $G_i \coloneqq Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(x)$ the [[automorphism group]] (def. \ref{InGrupoidAutomorphismGroup}) of any object $x$ in the given connected component.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Using the [[axiom of choice]] we may find a set $\{x_i\}_{i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G})}$ of objects of $\mathcal{G}$, with $x_i$ being in the [[connected component]] $i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G})$.

This choice induces a functor

$$
  inc
   \;\colon\;
  \underset{i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G})}{\sqcup} Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(x_i)
    \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{G}
$$

which takes each object and morphism "to itself".

Now using the [[axiom of choice]] once more, we choose in each connected component $i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G})$
and for each object $y$ in that connected component a morphism

$$
  x_i \overset{f_{x_i,y}}{\longrightarrow} y
  \,.
$$

Using this we obtain a functor the other way around

$$
  p \;\colon\; \mathcal{G} \longrightarrow \underset{i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G})}{\sqcup} Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(x_i)
$$

which sends each object to its connected component, and
which for pairs of objects $y$, $z$ of $\mathcal{G}$ is given by conjugation with the
morphisms choosen above:

$$
  \array{
    Hom_{\mathcal{G}}(y,z) &\overset{p_{y,z}}{\longrightarrow}& & Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(x_i) &
    \\
    \\
    y                 &&                     y & \overset{f_{x_i,y}}{\longleftarrow}& x_i
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}} \downarrow &\mapsto&     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow
    \\
    z                 &&                     z & \underset{f_{x_i,z}^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} & x_i
  }
  \,.
$$

It is now sufficient to show that there are conjugations/natural isomorphisms

$$
  p \circ inc \simeq id
  \phantom{AAAA}
  inc \circ p \simeq id
  \,.
$$

For the first this is immediate, since we even have equality

$$
  p \circ inc \;=\; id
  \,.
$$

For the second we observe that choosing

$$
  \eta(y) \coloneqq f_{x_i,y}
$$

yields a naturality square by the above construction:

$$
  \array{
    x_i &\overset{f_{x_i,y}}{\longrightarrow}& y
    \\
    {}^{ \mathllap{ f_{x_i,z} \circ f \circ f_{x_i,y}^{-1} } }\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    x_i &\underset{f_{x_i,z}}{\longrightarrow}& z
  }
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition
**([[weak homotopy equivalence]] is [[equivalence of groupoids]])

Let $F \;\colon\; \mathcal{G}_1 \longrightarrow \mathcal{G}_2$
be a homomorphism of [[groupoids]].

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] then the following are equivalent:

1. $F$ is an [[equivalence of groupoids]] (def. \ref{EquivalenceOfGroupoids});

1. $F$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] in that

   1. it induces an [[bijection]] of sets of [[connected]] components (def. \ref{GroupoidConnectedComponents});

      $$
        \pi_0(F) \;\colon\; \pi_0(\mathcal{G}_1) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_0(\mathcal{G}_0)
        \,,
      $$

  1. for each object $x \in \mathcal{G}_1$ it induces an isomorphism of [[automorphism groups]] (def. \ref{InGrupoidAutomorphismGroup}):

     $$
       F_{x,x} \;\colon\; Aut_{\mathcal{G}_1}(x) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Aut_{\mathcal{G}_2}(F_0(x))
       \,.
     $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


In one direction, if $F$ has an inverse up to natural isomorphism, then this induces by definition a bijection
on connected components, and it induces isomorphism on homotopy groups by lemma \ref{AutomorphismGroupDependsOnlyOnConnectedComponent}.

In the other direction, choose equivalences to [[skeleta]] as in prop. \ref{EveryGroupoidIsEquivalentToDisjointUnionOfGroupDeloopings}
to get a [[commuting diagram]] in the [[1-category]] of groupoids as follows:

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{G}_1 &\underoverset{\simeq}{inc_1}{\longleftarrow}& \underset{i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G}_1)}{\sqcup} Aut_{\mathcal{G}_1}(x_i)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde F }}
    \\
    \mathcal{G}_2 &\underoverset{inc_2}{\simeq}{\longleftarrow}& \underset{i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G}_1)}{\sqcup} Aut_{\mathcal{G}_2}(F_0(x_i))
  }
  \,.
$$

Here $inc_1$ and $inc_2$ are equivalences of groupoids by prop. \ref{EveryGroupoidIsEquivalentToDisjointUnionOfGroupDeloopings}.
Moreover, by assumption that $F$ is a weak homotopy equivalence $\tilde F$ is the union of of deloopings of 
isomorphisms of groups, and hence has a strict inverse, in particular a homotopy inverse, hence is in particular
an euivalence of groupoids. 

In conclusion, when regarded as a diagram in the [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Grpd)$ (def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfGroupoids}),
the top, bottom and right moprhism of the above diagram are isomorphisms. It follows that also 
$f$ is an isomorphism in $Ho(Grpd)$. But this means exactly that it is a homotopy equivalence of groupoids, by 
def. \ref{EquivalenceOfGroupoids}.

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] then the following holds:

Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a [[groupoid]]. Then its [[category of representations|category of]]
[[groupoid representations]] is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[product category]]
indexed by the set of [[connected components]] $\pi_0(\mathcal{G})$ (def. \ref{GroupoidConnectedComponents}) of [[group representations]]
of the [[automorphism group]] $G_i \coloneqq Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(x_i)$ (def. \ref{InGrupoidAutomorphismGroup}) for $x_i$ any object in the $i$th
connected component:

$$
  Rep(\mathcal{G})
   \;\simeq\;
  \underset{i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G})}{\prod} Rep(G_i)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the category that the representation is on. Then by definition

$$
  Rep(\mathcal{G}) = Hom( \mathcal{G} , \mathcal{C}  )
  \,.
$$

Consider the injection functor of the [[skeleton]] (from lemma \ref{DeloopingGroupoidEquivalence})

$$
  inc
  \;\colon\;
  \underset{i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G})}{\sqcup} B G_i
  \overset{}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{G}
  \,.
$$


By lemma \ref{HmotopiesWithMorphismsHorizontaComposition} the pre-composition with this constitutes a functor

$$
  inc^\ast \;\colon\; Hom( \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{C} ) \longrightarrow Hom( \underset{i \in \pi_0(\mathcal{G})}{\sqcup} B G_i, \mathcal{C} )
$$

and by combining lemma \ref{DeloopingGroupoidEquivalence} with lemma \ref{HorizontalCompositionWithHomotopyIsNaturalTransformation}
this is an [[equivalence of categories]]. Finally, by example \ref{GroupoidRepresentationOfDeloopingGroupoid} the
category on the right is the product of group representation categories as claimed.

\subsection{As 2-coskeletal Kan complexes}

Groupoids $K$ are equivalent to 1-[[hypergroupoids]], which are in particular 2-[[coskeletal]] [[Kan complexes]] $N(K)$ -- their [[nerves]].

The objects of the groupoids are the 0-[[simplices]] and the morphisms of the groupoid are the 1-simplices of the Kan complex. The [[composition]] operation $(f,g) \mapsto g \circ f $ in the grouopoid is encoded in the 2-simplices of the Kan complex

$$
  \array{
    && y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow &=& \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    x &&\underset{g\circ f}{\to}&& z
  }
  \,.
$$


The [[associativity]] condition on the composition is exhibited by the 3-[[coskeleton]]-property of the Kan complex. This says that every simplicial 2-sphere in the Kan complex has a unique filler. With the above identification of 2-simplices with composition operations, this means that the 2 ways

$$
  \array{
    y &\stackrel{g}{\to}& &\to& z
    \\
    \uparrow && &\nearrow&  \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\uparrow &^{\mathllap{g \circ f}}\nearrow& && \downarrow
    \\
    x &\underset{h \circ (g\circ f )}{\to}&&\to& w
  }
  \;\;\;
  and
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    y &\stackrel{g}{\to}& &\to& z
    \\
    \uparrow &\searrow& &&  \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\uparrow && &\searrow^{\mathrlap{h\circ g}}& \downarrow
    \\
    x &\underset{(h \circ g)\circ f}{\to}&&\to& w
  }
$$

of composing a sequence of three composable morphisms are equal

$$
  \array{
    y &\to& &\to& z
    \\
    \downarrow && &\nearrow&  \downarrow
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& && \downarrow
    \\
    x &\to&&\to& w
  }
  \;\;\;
  \stackrel{=}{\to}
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    y &\to& &\to& z
    \\
    \downarrow &\searrow& &&  \downarrow
    \\
    \downarrow && &\searrow& \downarrow
    \\
    x &\to&&\to& w
  }
  \,.
$$


For handling just groupoids exclusively their description in terms of Kan complexes may be a bit of an overkill, but the advantage is that it embeds groupoids naturally in the more general context of [[2-groupoid]]s, [[3-groupoid]]s and eventually [[∞-groupoid]]s. For instance a [[pseudo-functor]] out of an ordinary groupoid into a 2-groupoid is simply a homomorphism of the corresponding Kan complexes.

The disadvantage of the simplicial approach is the difficulty of describing multiple compositions in higher dimensions, an important idea which is quite conveniently  handled cubically.

## Idea


A [[differentiable manifold]] is a [[topological space]] which is _locally_ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[Euclidean space]] (a [[topological manifold]]) and such that the [[gluing functions]] which relate these Euclidean [[local charts]] to each other are [[differentiable functions]], for a fixed degree of differentiability. If one considers arbitrary differentiablity, then one speaks of _smooth manifolds_. For a general discussion see at _[[manifold]]_.


Differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for much of [[differential geometry]]. They are the analogs in differential geometry of what [[schemes]] are in [[algebraic geometry]].

If one relaxes the condition from being locally isomorphic to a Euclidean space to admitting local smooth maps from a Euclidean space, then one obtains the concept of [[diffeological spaces]] or even [[smooth sets]], see at _[[generalized smooth space]]_ for more on this.

The generalization of differentiable manifolds to [[higher differential geometry]] are [[orbifolds]] and more generally [[differentiable stacks]]. If one combines this with the generalization to [[smooth sets]] then one obtains the concept of [[smooth stacks]] and eventually [[smooth infinity-stacks]].

Smooth manifolds form a category, [[SmoothManifolds]].

## Definition

### Traditional definition

For the traditional definition see at _[[differentiable manifold]]_.

### Patching as idempotent splitting

In an exercise of his 1973 Perugia lectures [[F. William Lawvere]] reported a somewhat surprising observation:

In the case of [[smooth manifolds]] the process of piecing together the local data can be elegantly summed up as [[Karoubi envelope|splitting of idempotents]] in a category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces. More precisely:

Let $Diff$ be the category of [[smooth manifolds]] and [[smooth maps]], where by a "smooth manifold", we mean a finite-dimensional, second-countable, Hausdorff, $C^\infty$ [[manifold]] without boundary.  Let $i: Open \hookrightarrow Diff$ be the [[full subcategory]] whose objects are the [[open subspaces]] of finite-dimensional [[Cartesian spaces]]. 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
The subcategory $i: Open \hookrightarrow Diff$ exhibits $Diff$ as an idempotent-splitting completion of $Open$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
By a general [[Karoubi envelope#def2|lemma for idempotent splittings]], it suffices to prove that 

* Every smooth manifold is a smooth retract of an open set in Euclidean space; 

* If $p : U \to U$ is a smooth idempotent on an open set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, then the subset $Fix(p) \hookrightarrow U$ is an [[embedding of smooth manifolds|embedded]] submanifold. 

For the first statement, we use the fact that any manifold $M$ can be realized as a closed submanifold of some $\mathbb{R}^n$, and every closed submanifold has a [[tubular neighborhood theorem|tubular neighborhood]] $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. In this case $U$ carries a structure of vector bundle over $M$ in such a way that the inclusion $M \hookrightarrow U$ is identified with the zero section, so that the bundle projection $U \to M$ provides a retraction, with right inverse given by the zero section. 

For the second statement, assume that the origin $0$ is a fixed point of $p$, and let $T_0(U) \cong \mathbb{R}^n$ be its tangent space (observe the presence of a _canonical_ isomorphism to $\mathbb{R}^n$). Thus we have idempotent linear maps $d p(0), Id-d p(0): T_0(U) \to T_0(U)$ where the latter factors through the inclusion $\ker \; d p(0) \hookrightarrow T_0(U)$ via a projection map $\pi: T_0(U) \to \ker \; d p(0)$. We have a map $f: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ that takes $x \in U$ to $x - p(x)$; let $g$ denote the composite 

$$U \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n \cong T_0(U) \stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} \ker\; d p(0).$$ 

Now we make some easy observations: 

1. $Fix(p) \subseteq g^{-1}(0)$. 

1. The map $p: U \to U$ restricts to a map $p: g^{-1}(0) \to g^{-1}(0)$, by idempotence of $p$. 

1. The derivative $d g(0): T_0(U) \to T_0(\ker \; d p(0)) \cong \ker \; d p(0)$ is $\pi$ again since $Id - d p(0)$ is idempotent. Thus $d g(0)$ has full rank ($m$ say), and so the restriction of $g$ to some neighborhood $V$ has $0$ as a regular value, and $g^{-1}(0) \cap V$ is a manifold of dimension $m$ by the [[implicit function theorem]]. The tangent space $T_0(g^{-1}(0) \cap V)$ is canonically identified with $im(d p(0))$. 


1. There are smaller neighborhoods $V'' \subseteq V' \subseteq V$ so that $p$ restricts to maps $p_1, p_2$ as in the following diagram ($i, i', i''$ are inclusion maps, all taking a domain element $x$ to itself): 
$$\array{
g^{-1}(0) \cap V'' & \stackrel{i''}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0) \\ 
 _\mathllap{p_2} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\ 
g^{-1}(0) \cap V' & \stackrel{i'}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0) \\ 
 _\mathllap{p_1} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\ 
g^{-1}(0) \cap V & \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0)
}$$ 
and such that $p_1, p_2$ are diffeomorphisms by the [[implicit function theorem|inverse function theorem]] (noting here that $d p_i(0): im(d p(0)) \to im(d p(0))$ is the identity map, by idempotence of $p$). 

1. Letting $q: g^{-1}(0) \cap V' \to g^{-1}(0) \cap V''$ denote the smooth inverse to $p_2$, we calculate $i' = p \circ i'' \circ q$, and 
$$i p_1 = p i' = p p i''q = p i'' q = i',$$ 
so that $p_1(x) = x$ for every $x \in g^{-1}(0) \cap V'$. Hence $g^{-1}(0) \cap V' \subseteq Fix(p)$. 

From all this it follows that $Fix(p) \cap V' = g^{-1}(0) \cap V'$, meaning $Fix(p)$ is locally diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^m$, and so $Fix(p)$ is an embedded submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

[[F. William Lawvere|Lawvere]] comments on this fact as follows:
 
> {#LawvereComment} "This powerful theorem justifies bypassing the complicated considerations of charts, coordinate transformations, and atlases commonly offered as a "basic" definition of the concept of manifold. For example the 2-sphere, a manifold but not an open set of any Euclidean space, may be fully specified with its smooth structure by considering any open set $A$ in 3-space $E$ which contains it but not its center (taken to be $0$) and the smooth idempotent endomap of $A$ given by $e(x) = x/{|x|}$. All general constructions (i.e., functors into categories which are Cauchy complete) on manifolds now follow easily (without any need to check whether they are compatible with coverings, etc.) provided they are known on the opens of Euclidean spaces: for example, the tangent bundle on the sphere is obtained by splitting the idempotent $e'$ on the tangent bundle $A \times V$ of $A$ ($V$ being the vector space of translations of $E$) which is obtained by differentiating $e$. The same for cohomology groups, etc."  ([Lawvere 1989](#Law89), p.267)


### General abstract geometric definition
 {#GeneralAbstractCharacterization}

There is a fundamental and [[category theory|general abstract]] way to think of smooth manifolds, which realizes their theory as a special case of general constructions in [[higher geometry]]. 

In this context one specifies for instance $\mathcal{G}$ a [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]] and then plenty of geometric notions are defined canonically in terms of $\mathcal{G}$. The theory of smooth manifolds appears if one takes $\mathcal{G} = $ [[CartSp]]. 

Alternatively one can specify [[differential cohesion]] and proceed as discussed at _[differential cohesion -- structures - Cohesive manifolds (separated)](cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos+--+infinitesimal+cohesion#CohesivemanifoldsSeparated)_.

This is discussed in [The geometry CartSp](#TheGeometryCartSp) below.



#### The geometry $CartSp$ {#TheGeometryCartSp}

Let [[CartSp]] be the [[category]] of [[Cartesian space]]s and [[smooth function]]s between them. This has finite [[product]]s and is in fact (the [[syntactic category]]) of a [[Lawvere theory]]: the theory of [[smooth algebras]].

Moreover, $CartSp$ is naturally equipped with the [[good open cover]] [[coverage]] that makes it a [[site]]. 

Both properties together make it a [[pregeometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]] (if the notion of [[Grothendieck topology]] is relaxed to that of [[coverage]] in [StrSp](#StrSp)).

For $\mathcal{X}$ a [[topos]], a [[product]]-preserving [[functor]]

$$
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{X}
$$

is a $\mathcal{G}$-[[algebra over an algebraic theory|algebra]] in $\mathcal{X}$. This makes $\mathcal{X}$ is $\mathcal{G}$-[[ringed topos]]. For $\mathcal{G} = $ [[CartSp]] this algebra is a [[smooth algebra]] in $\mathcal{X}$. If $\mathcal{X}$ has a [[site]] of definition $X$, then this is a [[sheaf]] of [[smooth algebra]]s on $X$. 

If $\mathcal{O}$ sends [[covering]] families $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $\mathcal{G}$ to [[effective epimorphism]] $\coprod_i \mathcal{O}(U_i) \to \mathcal{O}(U)$ we say that it is a _local $\mathcal{G}$-algebra_ in $\mathcal{X}$, making $\mathcal{X}$ a $\mathcal{G}$-[[locally ringed topos]].

The [[big topos]] $Sh(\mathcal{G})$ itself is canonically equipped with such a local $\mathcal{G}$-algebra, given by the [[Yoneda embedding]] $j$ followed by [[sheafification]] $L$

$$
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \stackrel{j}{\to} PSh(\mathcal{G}) \stackrel{L}{\to}
  Sh(\mathcal{G})
  \,.
$$

It is important in the context of [[locally representable structured (infinity,1)-topos|locally representable locally ringed toposes]] that we regard $Sh(\mathcal{G})$ as equipped with this local $\mathcal{G}$-algebra. This is what remembers the [[site]] and gives a notion of local representability in the first place.

The [[big topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ is a [[cohesive topos]] of [[generalized smooth space]]s. Its [[concrete sheaves]] are precisely the [[diffeological space]]s. See there for more details. We now discuss how with $Sh(CartSp)$ regarded as a $CartSp$-structured topos, smooth manifolds are precisely its [[locally representable structured (infinity,1)-toposes|locally representable objects]].

#### Cartesian spaces as representable objects of $Sh(CartSp)$

The representables themselves should evidently be locally representable and canonically have the structure of $CartSp$-structured toposes.

Indeed, every object $U \in \mathrm{CartSp}$ is canonically a [[CartSp]]-[[ringed space]], meaning a [[topological space]] equipped with a local sheaf of [[smooth algebra]]s. More generally: every object $U \in CartSp$ is canonically incarnated as the $CartSp$-[[structured (∞,1)-topos]] 

$$
  (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}})
  :=
  (Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp)/U ,
    \;\;\; \mathcal{O}_U : CartSp \stackrel{j}{\to} Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp) \stackrel{U^*}{\to} Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp)/U)
$$ 

given by the [[over-(∞,1)-topos]] of the [[big topos|big]] [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over $CartSp$ and the [[structure sheaf]] given by the composite of the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] and the [[inverse image]] of the [[etale geometric morphism]] induced by $U$.


#### Smooth manifolds as locally representable objects of $Sh(CartSp)$ {#smoothManifoldsAsLocallyRepresentableObjects}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Say a [[concrete sheaf|concrete object]] $X$ in the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ -- a [[diffeological space]] -- is _locally representable_ if there exists a family of open embeddings $\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}_{i \in X}$ with $U_i \in CartSp \stackrel{j}{\hookrightarrow} Sh(CartSp)$ such that the canonical morphism out of the [[coproduct]]

$$
  \coprod_i U_i \to X
$$

is an [[effective epimorphism]] in $Sh(CartSp)$.

Let $LocRep(CartSp) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)$ be the full [[subcategory]] on locally representable sheaves.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Diff \simeq LocRep(CartSp)
$$


of the category [[Diff]] of smooth manifolds with that of locally representable sheaves for the [[geometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)|pre-geometry]] $CartSp$.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Define a functor $Diff \to LocRep(CartSp)$ by sending each smooth manifold to the sheaf over $CartSp$ that it naturally represents. By definition of [[manifold]] there is an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}$. We claim that $\coprod_i U_i \to X$ is an [[effective epimorphism]], so that this functor indeed lands in $LocRep(CartSp)$. (This is a standard argument of sheaf theory in [[Diff]], we really only need to observe that it goes through over [[CartSp]], too.)

For that we need to show that

$$
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_i U_i \to X
$$

is a [[coequalizer]] diagram in $Sh(CartSp)$ (that the [[Cech groupoid]] of the cover is equivalent to $X$.). Notice that the [[fiber product]] here is just the intersection in $X$ $U_i \times_X U_j \simeq U_i \cap U_j$. By the fact that the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ is by definition a [[reflective subcategory]] of the [[presheaf topos]] $PSh(CartSp)$ we have that [[colimit]]s in $Sh(CartSp)$ are computed as the [[sheafification]] of the corresponding colimit in $PSh(CartSp)$. The colimit in $PSh(CartSp)$ in turn is computed objectwise. Using this, we see that that we have a coequalizer diagram

$$
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_i U_i \to S(\{U_i\})
$$

in $PSh(CartSp)$, where $S(\{U_i\})$ is the [[sieve]] corresponding to the cover: the [[subfunctor]] $S(\{U_i\}) \hookrightarrow X$ of the functor $X : CartSp^{op} \to Set $ which assigns to $V \in CartSp$ the set of [[smooth function]]s $V \to X$ that have the property that they factor through any one of the $U_i$.

Essentially by the definition of the [[coverage]] on $CartSp$, it follows that [[sheafification]] takes this subfunctor inclusion to an [[isomorphism]]. This shows that $X$ is indeed the tip of the coequalizer in $Sh(CartSp)$ as above, and hence that it is a locally representable sheaf.

Conversely, suppose that for $X \in Conc(Sh(CartSp)) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)$ there is a family of open embeddings $\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}$ such that we have a coequalizer diagram

$$
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_{i} U_i \to X
$$

in $Sh(CartSp)$, which is the sheafification of the corresponding coequalizer in $PSh(CartSp)$. By evaluating this on the point, we find that the underlying set of $X$ is the coequalizer of the underlying set of the $U_i$ in $Set$. Since every plot of $X$ factors locally through one of the $U_i$ it follows that $X$ is a [[diffeological space]].  

It follows that in the pullback diagrams

$$
  \array{
    U_i \times_X U_j &\to& U_j
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   U_i &\to& X 
  }
$$

the object $U_i \cap U_j$ is the diffeological space whose underlying topological space is the intersection of $U_i$ and $U_j$ in the topological space underlying $X$. In particular the inclusions $U_i \times_X U_j \hookrightarrow U_i$ are open embeddings.

#### As locally representable $CartSp$-structured $(\infty,1)$-toposes

We may switch from regarding smooth manifolds as objects in the [[big topos]] $X \in Sh(CartSp)$ to regrading them as [[topos]]es themselves, by passing to the [[over-topos]] $Sh(CartSp)/X$. This remembers the extra (smooth) structure on the [[topological space]] $X$ by being canonically a [[locally ringed topos]] with the [[structure sheaf]] of [[smooth function]]s on $X$: a [[CartSp]]-[[structured (∞,1)-toposes]]


For every choice of [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]]   there is a notion of $\mathcal{G}$-[[locally representable structured (∞,1)-topos]] ([StrSp](#StrSp)). 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Claim

Smooth manifolds are equivalently the [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos|0-localic]] [[CartSp]]-[[generalized scheme]]s of locally finite presentation.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Sketch of proof

The statement says that a smooth manifold $X$ may be identified with an [[∞-stack]] on [[CartSp]] (an [[∞-Lie groupoid]]) which is represented by a [[CartSp]]-[[structured (∞,1)-topos]] $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}})$ such that

1. $\mathcal{X}$ is a [[n-localic (∞,1)-topos|0-localic (∞,1)-topos]];

1. There exists a family of objects $\{U_i \in \mathcal{X}\}$ such that the canonical morphism $\coprod_i U_i \to *_{\mathcal{X}}$ to the [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]] in $\mathcal{X}$ is a [[regular epimorphism]];

1. For every $i \in I$ there is an equivalence

  $$
    (\mathcal{X}/U_i, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}|U_i})
    \underoverset{\simeq}{t_i}{\to} (Sh_{(\infty,1)}(\mathbb{R}^n), \mathcal{O}(\mathbb{R}^n))
     \,.
  $$

The second and third condition say in words that $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}})$ is locally equivalent to the ordinary cannonically [[CartSp]]-[[locally ringed space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[dimension]]. The first condition then says that these local identifications cover $\mathcal{X}$.

## Definition

A [[function]] on a [[group]] is a **class function** if it is [[invariant]] under [[conjugation action]], i.e. it is equivalent to a function on the set of [[conjugacy classes]]. 

## Examples

Every [[group character]] is in particular a class function.

## Definitions

The basic concept is for [[vector spaces]], and the remainder are defined in terms of that.

+-- {: .num_defn #basis}
###### Definition

Given an [[ordered field]] $K$ and a [[vector space]] $V$ over $K$ of dimension $n$ (a [[natural number]]), an __orientation__ of $V$ is a choice of one of the two [[equivalence classes]] of [[ordered basis|ordered bases]] of $V$, where two bases are considered equivalent if the [[transformation matrix]] from one to the other has [[positive number|positive]] [[determinant]].
=--

In the case $n = 0$, the only ordered basis is the [[empty list]], but we still declare there to be two orientations by fiat, usually called positive and negative.  We can make the definition seamless by taking the elements of the equivalence class to be pairs consisting of an ordered basis and a nonzero [[sign]] (positive or negative), with $(B_1, s_1) \sim (B_2, s_2)$ iff $\sgn \det I^{B_1}_{B_2} = s_1/s_2$.  This is redundant except in dimension $0$, where now each equivalence class has a single element, $(*, +)$ for the positive orientation and $(*, -)$ for the negative orientation (where $*$ is the empty list).

In any case, this ensures that if $\omega$ is an orientation, then there is also an __opposite orientation__ $-\omega$.


A fancier way to say the same is
+-- {: .num_defn #bigwedge}
###### Definition

For $V$ a vector space of dimension $n$, an __orientation__ of $V$ is an equivalence class of nonzero elements of the [[line]] $\bigwedge^n V$, the $n$th [[alternating power]] of $V$, where two such elements are considered equivalent when either (hence each) is a positive multiple of the other.
=--

Note that by both definitions, an orientation of a [[line]] (with $n = 1$) is an equivalence class of nonzero elements.

Assuming that $K$ is the field of [[real numbers]] or something like it, we can generalize from vector spaces to vector bundles:

+-- {: .num_defn #bundle}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[manifold]] and $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $n$, an __orientation__ on $V$ is an [[equivalence class]] of [[trivialization|trivializations]] of the [[line bundle]] $\bigwedge^k V$ that is obtained by associating to each [[fiber]] of $V$ its $k$th [[alternating power]].
=--

Equivalently for a [[smooth manifold]] this is an equivalence class of an everywhere non-vanishing element of $\bigwedge^k_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(V)$, which may be considered the [[sign]] of the element.

+-- {: .num_defn #manifold}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[manifold]] of dimension $n$, an __orientation__ of $X$ is an orientation of the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ (or [[cotangent bundle]] $T^* X$).
=--

This is equivalently a choice of everywhere non-vanishing [[differential form]] on $X$ of degree $n$; the orientation may be considered the [[sign]] of the $n$-form (and the $n$-form\'s [[absolute value]] is a [[pseudoform|pseudo]]-$n$-form).

A vector space always has an orientation, but a manifold or bundle may not.  If an orientation exists, $V$ (or $X$) is called __orientable__.  If $X$ is [[connected space]] and $V$ (or $X$) is orientable, then there are exactly $2$ orientations; more generally, the entire bundle is orientable iff the restriction to each [[connected component]] is orientable, and then the number of orientations is $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of orientable components.  (Or we can always say that the number of orientations is $2^k 0^m$, where now $m$ is also the number of nonorientable components.


## Properties

### In terms of lifting through Whitehead tower 

An orientation on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ is equivalently a lift $\hat g$ of the classifying map $g : X \to \mathcal{B}O(n)$ of its [[tangent bundle]] through the fist step $S O(n) \to O(n)$ in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $X$:

$$
  \array{
    && \mathcal{B}S O(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathcal{B} O(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

From this perspective a choice of orientation is the first in a series of special structures on $X$ that continue with

* **orientation**

* [[spin structure]]

* [[string structure]], [[differential string structure]]

* [[fivebrane structure]], [[differential fivebrane structure]]


### In terms of orientation in generalized cohomology

For $R$ an [[E-∞ ring]] spectrum, there is a general notion of $R$-orientation of vector bundles. This is described at

* [[orientation in generalized cohomology]].

For $R = H(\mathbb{R})$ be the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]
for the [[discrete group|discrete]] [[abelian group]] $\mathbb{R}$
of [[real number]]s, orientation in $R$-cohomology is equivalent to the 
ordinary notion of orientation described above.

## Idea

_Complex conjugation_ is the operation on [[complex numbers]] which reverses the sign of the [[imaginary part]], hence the [[function]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{C} 
    &
      \overset{ 
        \;\;\;
        (-)^\ast 
        \;\;\;
      }{
        \longrightarrow
      }
    &
    \mathbb{C}
    \\
    a + \mathrm{i} b &\mapsto&  a - \mathrm{i} b
  }
  \phantom{AAAAAA}
  for\;\; a,b \in \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

More generally, the [[anti-involution]] on any [[star-algebra]] may be referred to as _conjugation_. For instance one speaks of _quaternionc conjugation_ for the analogous operation on [[quaternions]]:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{H} 
    &
      \overset{ 
        \;\;\;
        (-)^\ast 
        \;\;\;
      }{
        \longrightarrow
      }
    &
    \mathbb{H}
    \\
    a 
      + \mathrm{i} b 
      + \mathrm{j} c 
      + \mathrm{k} d 
    &\mapsto&  
    a
      - \mathrm{i} b 
      - \mathrm{j} c 
      - \mathrm{k} d 
  }
  \phantom{AAAAAA}
  for\;\; a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

The __symmetric difference__ of two sets $A$ and $B$ (either [[pure sets]] or [[subsets]] of some fixed [[set]]), written $A \uplus B$ (and a host of other ways), may be defined using [[exclusive disjunction]]:
$$ A \uplus B = \{ x \;|\; x \in A \;&#8891;\; x \in B \} .$$
You can also call this [[exclusive union]], especially if you want to use it analogously to exclusive disjunction; then the exclusive union of $n$ sets consists of those elements $x$ that belong to exactly one of the $n$ sets.

The term _symmetric difference_, however, is usually used as the addition in a [[Boolean ring]] and so interpreted as an associative operation; then the symmetric difference of $n$ sets consists of those elements $x$ that belong to an *odd* number of the $n$ sets.

The [[empty set]] is the [[identity element|identity]] for this operation; it is the symmetric difference (or exclusive union, for that matter) of no sets.

In [[constructive mathematics]], the symmetic difference cannot be proved associative and so becomes less useful (unless one restricts attention to sets with [[decidable equality]], where it can be proved associative).  This is a problem in [[measure theory]]; see [[Cheng measurable space]] for one way to fix this.

Note that the [[union]], symmetric difference, and (internal, or external up to [[natural isomorphism]]) [[disjoint union]] of a family of (pairwise) [[disjoint sets]] are all the same.  For a family that is not disjoint, however, the union and symmetric difference are different, the internal disjoint union does not make sense, and the external disjoint union is not isomorphic to either the union or the symmetric difference (at least not naturally, and in some cases not at all).

## Idea

For $H  \hookrightarrow G$ a [[subgroup]] inclusion, its _index_ is the number  ${\vert G: H\vert}$ of $H$-[[cosets]] in $G$, hence roughly is the number of copies of $H$ that appear in $G$.


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $H  \hookrightarrow G$ a [[subgroup]], its **index** is the [[cardinality]] 

$$
  {\vert G : H\vert} \coloneqq {\vert G/H\vert}
$$

of the set $G/H$ of [[cosets]].

=--


## Properties

### Multiplicativity

If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, the coset projection $-H: G\to G/H$ sends an element $g$ of $G$ to its orbit $gH$. 

If $s : G/H\to G$ is a section of the coset projection $-H: G\to G/H$, then $G/H \times H \to G$ given by $( g H , h )\mapsto s( g H ) h^{-1}$ is a bijection. Its inverse is given by the set map $G\to G/H \times H$ given by $g\mapsto ( g H , g^{-1} s( g H ) )$. Note that the induced product projections $G\to G/H$ conincides with the coset projection.

This argument can be internalized to a group object $G$ and a subgroup object $G$ in a category $C$. In this case, the coset projection $-H: G\to G/H$ is the coequalizer of the action on $G$ by multiplication of $H$. The coset projection need not have a section. However, in case such sections exist, each section $s$ of the coset projection, the above argument internalized yields an isomorphism 
$$
G/H \times H \overset{\simeq}\rightarrow G
\, .
$$ 

Even more generally, if $H \hookrightarrow K \hookrightarrow G$ is a sequence of [[subgroup]] objects, then each section of the projection $G/H \to G/K$ yields an isomorphism 
$$
  G/K \,\times \, K/H \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} G/H
\, .
$$

Returning to the case of ordinary groups, i.e. group objects internal to $Set$, where the external axiom of choice is assumed to hold, the coset projection, being a coequalizer and hence an epimorphism, has a section. This gives the multiplicative property of the indices of a sequence $H \hookrightarrow K \hookrightarrow G$ of [[subgroups]] 

$$
  {\vert G : K\vert} \dot {\vert K : H\vert}
  = 
  {\vert G : H\vert}
  \,.
$$

### Finite groups

The concept of index is meaningful especially for finite groups, i.e. groups internal to [[FinSet]]. See, for example, its role in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. 

Multiplicativity of the index has the following corollary, which is known as **[[Lagrange's theorem]]**: If $G$ is a [[finite group]], then the index of any subgroup is the quotient

$$
  {\vert G : H\vert} = \frac{{\vert G\vert}}{\vert H\vert}
$$

of the [[order of a group|order]] ([[cardinality]] = number of elements) of $G$ by that of $H$.



## Examples

* For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n \geq 1$ and $\mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot n}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbb{Z}$ the subgroup of the [[integers]] given by those that are multiples of $n$, the index is $n$.

# Power sets
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definition

Given a [[set]] $S$, the __power set__ of $S$ is the set $\mathcal{P}S$ of all [[subsets]] of $S$.  Equivalently, it is 

* the set $\TV^S$ of all [[functions]] from $S$ to the set $\TV$ of [[truth values]].  This is often written $2^S$, since there are (at least in [[classical logic]]) exactly $2$ truth values;

* the collection of [[subobjects]] of $X$ in the [[topos]] [[Set]].

* the [[slice category]] $Inj/S$, where [[Inj]] is the [[wide subcategory]] of [[Set]] with morphisms restricted to [[injection|injections]]. This is similar to the subobject definition but is more unpacked. $Inj/S$ has objects that are injections to $S$ and morphisms that are commuting triangles of injections.


## Foundational status

One generally needs a specific axiom in the [[foundations of mathematics]] to ensure the existence of power sets.  In [[material set theory]], this can be phrased as follows:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Axiom (power sets)

If $S$ is a set, then there exists a set $\mathcal{P}$ such that $A \in \mathcal{P}$ if $A \subseteq S$.
=--

One can then use the [[axiom of separation]] ([[bounded separation]] is enough) to prove that $\mathcal{P}$ may be chosen so that the subsets of $A$ are the *only* members of $\mathcal{P}$; the [[axiom of extensionality]] proves that this $\mathcal{P}$ is unique.

Alternatively, one could include a [[powerset structure]], a primitive unary operator $\mathcal{P}(S)$ such that for all sets $S$, if for all sets $A$ and sets $B$, $B \in A$ implies that $B \in S$, then $A \in \mathcal{P}(S)$. 

In [[structural set theory]], we state rather that there exists a set $\mathcal{P}$ which indexes the subsets of $A$ and prove uniqueness [[generalised the|up to unique isomorphism]].

In [[predicative mathematics]], the existence of power sets (along with other "impredicative" axioms) is not accepted.  However we can still speak of a power set as a [[proper class]], sometimes called a __power class__.

One can use power sets to construct [[function sets]]; the converse also works using [[excluded middle]] (or anything else that will guarantee the existence of the set of truth values).  In particular, power sets exist in any theory containing excluded middle and function sets; thus predicative theories which include function sets must also be [[constructive mathematics|constructive]].


## Properties

### General

* The power set $\mathcal{P}S$ is a [[partial order|poset]] ordered by containment: $A$ precedes $B$ means that $A$ is a [[subset]] of $B$ ($A \subseteq B$).


* [[Cantor's theorem]] states that there exists no [[surjection]] from $S$ to $\mathcal{P}S$; as there does exist such an [[injection]], one concludes that
$$ {|S|} \lt {|\mathcal{P}S|} $$
in the usual arithmetic of [[cardinal numbers]].

* Power sets live in the category [[Set]].  Given an object $S$ of any [[category]], one can similarly form a poset of [[subobjects]] of $S$; the category is called [[well-powered category|well-powered]] when this poset is [[small category|small]].  One also has an internal notion of power set (a [[power object]]) in a [[topos]].

* The power set construction constitutes an [[equivalence of categories]] between the [[opposite category]] [[Set]]$^{op}$ and that of [[complete atomic Boolean algebras]]. See at _[Set -- Properties -- Opposite category and Boolean algebras](Set#OppositeCategory)_. Restricted to [[finite sets]], the power set construction constitutes an [[equivalence of categories]] between the [[opposite category]] of [[FinSet]] and that of finite [[Boolean algebras]]. See at _[FinSet -- Opposite category](FinSet#OppositeCategory)_.

### Power set functor

The power set construction gives rise to two functors, the contravariant power set functor $Set^op \to Set$ and the covariant power set functor $Set \to Set$. The first sends a function $f\colon S\to T$ to the _preimage_ function $f^*\colon P(T) \to P(S)$, whereas the second sends $f$ to the _image_ function $f_*\colon P(S) \to P(T)$.

One would like to embed an abstract [[group]] into a bigger group $K$ in which every [[automorphism]] of $G$ is obtained by restricting (to $G$) an [[inner automorphism]] of $K$ that fixes $G$ as a subset of $K$.  The holomorph is the universal (smallest) solution to this problem.

Each group $G$ embeds into the symmetric group $Sym(G)$ on the [[underlying set]] of $G$ by the left [[regular representation]] $g\mapsto l_g$ where $l_g(h) = g h$. The [[image]] is isomorphic to $G$ (that is, the left regular representation of a discrete group is [[faithful representation|faithful]]). The [[normalizer]] of the image of $G$ in $Sym(G)$ is called the __holomorph__.

The holomorph occurs very naturally as the group of arrows of the [[2-group]] (groupoid internal to $Groups$).

Let $(X, \tau_X)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $Y \subset X$ be a [[subset]] of its underlying [[set]]. Then the corresponding _[[topological subspace]]_ has $Y$ as its underlying set, and its [[open subsets]] are those subsets of $Y$ which arise as restrictions of open subsets of $X$ (i.e. [[intersections]] of open subsets of $X$ with $Y$):

$$
  \left(
    U_Y \subset Y\,\,\text{open}
  \right)
    \,\Leftrightarrow\,
  \left(
     \underset{U_X \in \tau_X}{\exists} \left( U_Y = U_X \cap Y \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$


In other words, $\tau_Y$ is the [[finer topology|smallest topology]] on $Y$ such that the inclusion $Y \hookrightarrow X$ is [[continuous map|continuous]] (the [[initial topology]] on that map). 

The picture on the right shows two open subsets inside the [[square]], regarded as a [[topological subspace]] of the [[plane]] $\mathbb{R}^2$:

> graphics grabbed from [Munkres 75](#Munkres75)


=--

The pair $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is then said to be a *topological [[subspace]]* of $(X,\tau_X)$. The induced topology is for that reason sometimes called the **subspace topology** on $Y$. 

A continuous function that factors as a [[homeomorphism]] onto its [[image]] equipped with the subspace topology is called an _[[embedding of topological spaces]]_.  Such a map is referred to as a _subspace inclusion_.

A property of topological spaces is said to be **hereditary** if its satisfaction for a topological space $X$ implies its satisfaction for all topological subspaces of $X$. 

## Examples

* The [[open subsets]] of a [[closed interval]] $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$ regarded as a topological subspace of the [[real line]] equipped with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] is generated from the [[sub-base of a topology|sub-base]] $\beta = \{ [0, a) ,(a,1]\}_{a \in [0,1]}$.

###### Proposition
**([[universal property]] of [[subspace topology]])**


Let $U \overset{i}{\longrightarrow} X$ be an [[injective function|injective]] [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]]. Then this is a [[topological subspace|subspace inclusion]] (Def. \ref{SubspaceTopology}) precisely if it satisfies the following [[universal property]]: 

* For $Z$ any topological space, a [[function]] $Z \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} U$ (of underlying [[sets]]) is [[continuous function|continuous]] precisely if the [[composition]] $i \circ f$ is continuous as a function to $X$:

  $$
    \array{
       Z &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& U
       \\
       &{}_{\mathllap{i \circ f}}\searrow& \Big\downarrow{}^{\mathrlap{i}}
       \\
       && X
    }
  $$

The elementary **proof** is spelled out, for instance, in [Terilla 14, theorem 1](#Terilla14). Of course this is just another way to speak of the [[initial topology]].

The universal characterization of Prop. \ref{UniversalPropertyOfSupspaceInclusion} lends itself to formalization via axioms for [[cohesion]]:

be the pair of [[adjoint functors]] given by sending a [[topological space]] $X$ to its underlying [[set]] $\Gamma(X)$, and by equipping a [[set]] $S$ with the [[codiscrete topology]] making it a [[codiscrete space]] $coDisc(X)$.

Write

$$
  \sharp \;\coloneqq\; coDisc \circ \Gamma

for the induced [[modal operator]] on [[Top]] ([[sharp modality]]). We write

$$
  id \overset{\eta^{\sharp}}{\longrightarrow} \sharp

for the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] morphism of this [[adjunction]].

Notice that this means that for any [[topological space]] $Z$, _every_ function of underlying sets

$$
  Z \longrightarrow \sharp X
$$

is [[continuous functions]], hence that continuous functions into $\sharp X$ are in [[natural bijection]] to underlying functions of [[sets]]. This is the statement of the adjunction hom-isomorphism:

By the [[universal property]] of a [[pullback]]/[[fiber product]] and the nature of $\sharp$, we have $U \simeq X \times_{\sharp X} \sharp U$ precisely if continuous functions out of some topological space $Z$ into $U$ are in [[natural bijection]] with continuous functions  $Z \to X$ whose underlying function $Z \to X \to \sharp X$ factors through the underlying function of $i$.

###### Remark
**(formulation in [[cohesive homotopy type theory]])**

The pullback square of the $\sharp$-unit in Prop. \ref{UniversalPropertyViaSharpModality} should correspond (after generalizing from [[topological spaces]] to suitable [[topological ∞-groupoids]]) to the [[categorical semantics]] of what in [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] is the statement that the [[characteristic function]]

$$
  \chi_U \;\colon\; X \to Prop
$$

to the [[universe of propositions]] factors through the universe of [[sharp modality|sharp]]-[[modal types]]. In this form topological subspace inclusions are characterized in [Shulman 15, Remark 3.14](#Shulman15).

=--

### General

A subspace $i: Y \hookrightarrow X$ is **closed** if $Y$ is [[closed subset|closed]] as a subset of $X$ (or if $i$ is a [[closed map]]), and is **open** if $Y$ is open as a subset of $X$ (or if $i$ is an [[open map]]). 


+-- {: .num_prop #TopologicalEmbeddingsAreTheRegularMonos} 
###### Proposition 

Topological subspace inclusions ([[topological embedding]]) are precisely the [[regular monomorphisms]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of all [[topological spaces]]. 

=-- 

For example, the [[equalizer]] of two maps $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\to}{\to} Y$ in [[Top]] is computed as the equalizer at the underlying-set level, equipped with the subspace topology. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #pushout} 
###### Lemma 
The [[pushout]] in [[Top]] of any (closed/open) subspace $i \colon A \hookrightarrow B$ along any [[continuous function]] $f \colon A \to C$, 

$$\array{
A & \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} & B \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & po & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
C & \underset{j}{\hookrightarrow} & D,
}$$ 

is a (closed/open) subspace $j: C \hookrightarrow D$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Since $U = \hom(1, -): Top \to Set$ is [[faithful functor|faithful]], we have that monos are reflected by $U$; also monos and pushouts are preserved by $U$ since $U$ has both a [[left adjoint]] and a [[right adjoint]]. In $Set$, the pushout of a mono along any map is a mono, so we conclude $j$ is monic in $Top$. Furthermore, such a pushout diagram in $Set$ is also a pullback, so that we have the [[Beck-Chevalley condition|Beck-Chevalley equality]] $\exists_i \circ f^\ast = g^\ast \exists_j \colon P(C) \to P(B)$ (where $\exists_i \colon P(A) \to P(B)$ is the [[direct image]] map between [[power sets]], and $f^\ast: P(C) \to P(A)$ is the [[inverse image]] map). 

To prove that $j$ is a subspace, let $U \subseteq C$ be any open set. Then there exists open $V \subseteq B$ such that $i^\ast(V) = f^\ast(U)$ because $i$ is a subspace inclusion. If $\chi_U \colon C \to \mathbf{2}$ and $\chi_V \colon B \to \mathbf{2}$ are the maps to [[Sierpinski space]] that classify these open sets, then by the universal property of the pushout, there exists a unique continuous map $\chi_W \colon D \to \mathbf{2}$ which extends the pair of maps $\chi_U, \chi_V$. It follows that $j^{-1}(W) = U$, so that $j$ is a subspace inclusion. 

If moreover $i$ is an open inclusion, then for any open $U \subseteq C$ we have that $j^\ast(\exists_j(U)) = U$ (since $j$ is monic) and (by Beck-Chevalley) $g^\ast(\exists_j(U)) = \exists_i(f^\ast(U))$ is open in $B$. By the definition of the topology on $D$, it follows that $\exists_j(U)$ is open, so that $j$ is an open inclusion. The same proof, replacing the word "open" with the word "closed" throughout, shows that the pushout of a closed inclusion $i$ is a closed inclusion $j$. 
=-- 
 
A similar (but even simpler) line of argument establishes the following result. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #transfinite} 
###### Lemma 
Let $\kappa$ be an [[ordinal]], viewed as a [[preorder]] category, and let $F: \kappa \to Top$ be a functor that preserves [[directed colimits]]. Then if $F(i \leq j)$ is a (closed/open) subspace inclusion for each morphism $i \leq j$ of $\kappa$, then the canonical map $F(0) \to colim_{i \in \kappa} F(i)$ is also a (closed/open) inclusion. 
=-- 

## Variations

There is also a notion of a [[Grothendieck topology]] induced along a [[functor]] from a Grothendieck topology on another category (actually the input can be a somewhat more general [[coverage]], then the topology induced along the [[identity functor]] will serve as a sort of a completion). (this will be explained later).

A topology may be induced by more than a [[function]] other than a subset inclusion, or indeed by a family of functions out of $Y$ (not necessarily all with the same [[target]]). However, the term 'induced topology' is often (usually?) restricted to subspaces; the general concept is called a [[weak topology]].  (This construction can be done in any [[topological concrete category]]; in this generality it is often called an [[initial structure]] for a [[sink|source]].)  The dual construction (involving functions to $Y$) is a [[strong topology]] (or [[final structure]] for a [[sink]]); an example is the [[quotient topology]] on a [[quotient space]].

## Definition


For $Aut(\{1, \cdots , n\}) \simeq S_n$ the [[symmetric group]] on $n \in \mathbb{N}$ elements, the _signature_ is the unique [[group]] [[homomorphism]]

$$
  sign : S_n \to \mathbb{Z}_2 = \{1, -1\}
$$

that sends each transposition $s_{i, i+1} : \{1, \cdots, n\} \to \{1, \cdots, n\}$, which interchanges the $i$th element with its neighbour and leaves the other elements fixed, to the nontrivial element $(-1) \in \mathbb{Z}_2$. 

Permutations in the kernel of $sign$ are called _even_ permutations, and the rest are called _odd_ permutations. 

+-- {: .un_lem}
###### Lemma 
The signature is well-defined. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
One way of seeing this is invoking a standard [[group presentation]] of $S_n$ where generators $\sigma_i$ for $i = 1$ to $n-1$ (representing $s_{i, i+1}$) are subject to relations 

$$\sigma_{i}^2 = 1, \qquad (\sigma_i \sigma_{i+1})^3 = 1, \qquad \sigma_i \sigma_j = \sigma_j \sigma_i \; ({|i-j|} \gt 1),$$ 

and checking that the sign applied to both sides of a relation equation gives the same result. 

Another is by invoking a tautological representation of $S_n$ on a [[polynomial algebra]] $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, 

$$S_n \stackrel{\cong}{\to} Set_{core}(\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}, \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}) \to CRing_{core}(\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n], \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n])$$ 

(where [[core]] refers to the groupoid of invertible morphisms) and recognizing that for the special polynomial 

$$D \coloneqq \prod_{i \lt j} (x_i - x_j)$$ 

we have, for each permutation $\tau$, either $\tau \cdot D = D$ or $\tau \cdot D = -D$. (The polynomial $\Delta \coloneqq D^2$, which is invariant under the action, is called the [[discriminant]].) 
=-- 

## Computations 

There are various means for computing the signature (also called **sign**) of a permutation. 

The definition itself suggests one method: if we linearly [[total order|order]] the set $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ by $x_1 \lt \ldots \lt x_n$, then we can exhibit a permutation $\tau$ by a [[string diagram]] and simply count the number of crossings $I(\tau)$; then we have 

$$sign(\tau) = (-1)^{I(\tau)}.$$ 

Each crossing corresponds to a pair of elements $x_i \lt x_j$ such that $\tau(x_i) \gt \tau(x_j)$, called an **inversion**. 

Another method which does not depend on choosing a total order is to exhibit a permutation through its [cycle decomposition](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/permutation#via_cycle_decompositions_6). Each cycle of period $k$ contributes a sign $(-1)^{k-1}$, and the overall sign is the product of these contributions taken over all the cycles. Thus the signature is given by the parity of the number of cycles of even length. 

This cycle description can actually be used to give an independent definition of the signature. It is manifestly well-defined and invariant on conjugacy classes. To check that it defines a homomorphism to $\{1, -1\}$, it suffices to check that multiplication by a transposition changes the parity of the number of even-length cycles by one. This is easy if we note that transposing two elements belonging to different cycles merges two cycles into one, whereas transposing two elements belonging to the same cycle splits one cycle into two.

## Definition

For $p$ a [[prime number]], a [[group]] is _$p$-primary_ if each of its elements $g$ has a [[prime power]] [[order of a group|order]] $p^{n(g)}$.

(Also called _primary group_ a _$p$-group_, but NO relation to _[[n-group]]_.)

## Properties

### Relation to finite abelian group

The [[fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups]] stats that every [[finite abelian group]] is a [[direct sum]] of its $p$-primary subgroups.

These are often called its _$p$-primary parts_ or _$p$-primary components_. See also at _[[Adams spectral sequence]]_ and for instance at _[[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]_.

### Nilpotency 

+-- {: .num_prop #center} 
###### Proposition 
Every [[finite set|finite]] $p$-primary group $G$ has a nontrivial [[center of a group|center]] $Z(G)$. 
=-- 

For a proof, see [[class equation]]. 

Since the center $Z(G)$ is a [[normal subgroup]] of $G$, we may define by induction (with the help of this proposition [here](/nlab/show/normal+subgroup#inverse)) a series of inclusions of normal subgroups $Z^k(G) \subseteq G$ where $Z^0(G)$ is the trivial subgroup and $Z^k(G)$ is the inverse image of the center $Z(G/Z^{k-1}(G))$ along the canonical homomorphism $G \to G/Z^{k-1}(G)$. The resulting series 

$$Z^0(G) \subseteq \ldots \subseteq Z^{k-1}(G) \subseteq Z^k(G) \subseteq \ldots$$ 

is called the *upper central series* of $G$, and Proposition \ref{center} shows that in the case of a finite $p$-group, this series consists of strict inclusions that eventually terminate in the full subgroup $G$. A group with that property is a [[nilpotent group]]. In particular it is a [[solvable group]].

## Idea

An embedding is, generally, a [[morphism]] which in some sense is an [[isomorphism]] onto its [[image]]

For this to make sense in a given [[category]] $C$, we not only need a good notion of image.  Note that it is not enough to have the image of $f\colon X \to Y$ as a [[subobject]] $\im f$ of $Y$; we also need to be able to interpret $f$ as a morphism from $X$ to $\im f$, because it is this morphism that we are asking to be an isomorphism.


* [[effective epimorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular epimorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[covering]]

* [[effective monomorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular monomorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[embedding]] .


## As regular or effective monomorphisms

### Definition

One general abstract way to define an _embedding_ morphism is to say that this is equivalently a [[regular monomorphism]].

If the ambient category has finite [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s, then this is equivalently an [[effective monomorphism]]. In terms of this we recover a formalization of the above idea, that an embedding is an iso onto its _image_ :

For a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in $C$ the definition of [image as an equalizer](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/image#AsEqualizer) says that the [[image]] of $f$ is

$$
  im f := \lim_\leftarrow ( Y \stackrel{\to}{\to} Y \coprod_X Y) 
  \,.
$$ 

In particular we have a factorization of $f$ as

$$
  f : X \stackrel{\tilde f}{\to} im f \hookrightarrow Y
  \,,
$$

where the morphism on the right is a [[monomorphism]].

The morphism $f$ being an [[effective monomorphism]] means that $\tilde f$ is an [[isomorphism]], hence that $f$ is an "isomomorphism onto its image".

## In dependent type theory

Assume that the [[dependent type theory]] has [[identity types]], [[dependent identity types]], and [[uniqueness quantifiers]]. Then a family of elements $x:A \vdash f(x):B$ is an **embedding** if there is a family of elements
$$x:A, y:A, q:f(x) =_B f(y) \vdash \eta(x, y, q):\exists! p:x =_A y.ap_f(x, y, p) =_{f(x) =_B f(y)} q$$
which states that for all identities $q:f(x) =_B f(y)$ there is a unique identity $p:x =_A y$ up to identity such that $ap_f(x, y, p) =_{f(x) =_B f(y)} q$. 

Equivalently, if the [[dependent type theory]] also has [[existential quantifiers]], then $x:A \vdash f(x):B$ is an embedding if there is a family of elements 
$$y:B, z:\exists x:A.f(x) =_B y \vdash p(y, z):\exists! x:A.f(x) =_B y$$ 
which states that for all $y:B$, if there exists an element $x:A$ such that $f(x) =_B y$, then that element is unique up to identity. 

## Examples

### In $Top$

A morphism $U \to X$ of [[topological space]]s is a regular monomorphism precisely if this is an injection such that the topology on $U$ is the [[induced topology]]. This is an **[[embedding of topological spaces]]**.

# Inner product spaces
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

An __inner product space__ ("scalar product", i.e. with values in [[scalars]]) is a [[vector space]] $V$ equipped with a (conjugate)-symmetric [[bilinear form|bilinear]] or [[sesquilinear form]]: a [[linear map]] from the [[tensor product]] $V \otimes V$ of $V$ with itself, or of $V$ with its [[dual module]] $\bar{V} \otimes V$  to the [[ground ring]] $k$.

One often studies _positive-definite_ inner product spaces; for these, see [[Hilbert space]].  Here we do not assume positivity (positive semidefiniteness) or definiteness (nondegeneracy). See also [[bilinear form]]. 

The group of automorphisms of an inner product space is the [[orthogonal group of an inner product space]].


## Definitions

Let $V$ be a [[vector space]] over the [[field]] (or more generally a [[ring]]) $k$.  Suppose that $k$ is equipped with an [[involution]] $r \mapsto \bar{r}$, called _conjugation_; in many examples, this will simply be the [[identity function]], but not always.  An __inner product__ on $V$ is a function
$$ \langle {-},{-} \rangle: V \times V \to k $$
that is (1--3) _sesquilinear_ (or _bilinear_ when the involution is the identity) and (4) _conjugate-symmetric_ (or _symmetric_ when the involution is the identity).  That is:

1.  $ \langle 0, x \rangle = 0 $ and $ \langle x, 0 \rangle = 0 $;
2.  $ \langle x + y, z \rangle = \langle x, z \rangle + \langle y, z \rangle $ and $ \langle x, y + z \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle + \langle x, z \rangle $;
3.  $ \langle c x, y \rangle = \bar{c} \langle x, y \rangle $ and 
$\langle x, c y \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle c$;
4.  $ \langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle} $.

Here we use the _physicist\'s convention_ that the inner product is antilinear (= conjugate-linear) in the first variable rather than in the second, rather than the _mathematician\'s convention_, which is the reverse.  The physicist\'s convention fits in a little better with $2$-[[2-Hilbert space|Hilbert space]]s and is often used in a generalization for [[Hilbert module]]s.  Note that we use the same ring as values of the inner product as for [[scalars]]. Notice that $\langle x, c y \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle c$ is written with $c$ on the right for the case that we deal with noncommutative division ring.

+-- {: .query}
Are the two conventions really equivalent when $k$ is noncommutative?  &#8212;Toby
=--

(The axiom list above is rather redundant.  First of all, (1) follows from (3) by setting $c = 0$; besides that, (1--3) come in pairs, only one of which is needed, since each half follows from the other using (4).  It is even possible to derive (3) from (2) under some circumstances.)

An __inner product space__ is simply a vector space equipped with an inner product.


We define a function ${\|{-}\|^2}\colon V \to k$ by ${\|x\|^2} = \langle x, x \rangle$; this is called the __norm__ of $x$.  As the notation suggests, it is common to take the norm of $x$ to be the square root of this expression in contexts where that makes sense, but for us ${\|{-}\|^2}$ is an atomic symbol.  The norm of $x$ is __real__ in that it equals its own conjugate, by (4).


## Definiteness
   {#definite}

Notice that, by (1), $\langle 0, y \rangle = 0$ for all $y$.  In fact, the [[subset]] $\{ x \;|\; \forall y,\; \langle x, y \rangle = 0 \}$ is a [[linear subspace]] of $V$.  Of course, we also have ${\|0\|^2} = 0$, but $\{ x \;|\; {\|x\|^2} = 0 \}$ may not be a subspace.  These observations motivate some possible conditions on the inner product:

*  The inner product is __semidefinite__ if $\{ x \;|\; {\|x\|^2} = 0 \}$ *is* closed under addition (and hence is a subspace); it\'s __indefinite__ if there are $x$ and $y$ with ${\|x\|^2} = 0$ and ${\|y\|^2} = 0$ but ${\|x + y\|^2} \ne 0$.
*  The inner product is __nondegenerate__ if $x = 0$ whenever $\langle x, y \rangle = 0$ for all $y$; it\'s __degenerate__ if there is $x$ with $x \ne 0$ but $\langle x, y \rangle = 0$ for all $y$.
*  The inner product is __definite__ if $x = 0$ whenever ${\|x\|^2} = 0$; there ought to be a term for the condition that there is some $x \ne 0$ with ${\|x\|^2} = 0$, so let\'s call it __nondefinite__.

(In [[constructive mathematics]], we usually want an [[inequality relation]] relative to which the vector-space operations and the inner product are [[strongly extensional function|strongly extensional]], to make sense of the conditions with $\ne$ in them.  We can also use [[contrapositives]] to put $\ne$ in the other conditions, which makes them stronger if the inequality relation is [[tight relation|tight]].)

An inner product is definite iff it\'s both semidefinite and nondegenerate.  Semidefinite inner products behave very much like definite ones; you can mod out by the elements with norm $0$ to get a [[quotient vector space|quotient space]] with a definite inner product.  In a similar way, every inner product space has a nondegenerate quotient.


Now suppose that $k$ is equipped with a [[partial order]].  (Note that the [[complex numbers]] are standardly so equipped, with $a \leq b$ iff $b - a$ is a nonnegative real.)  Then we can consider other conditions on the inner product:

*  The inner product is __positive semidefinite__, or simply __positive__, if ${\|x\|^2} \geq 0$ always.
*  The inner product is __positive definite__ if it is both positive and definite, in other words if ${\|x\|^2} \gt 0$ whenever $x \ne 0$.
*  The inner product is __negative semidefinite__, or simply __negative__, if ${\|x\|^2} \leq 0$ always.
*  The inner product is __negative definite__ if it is both positive and definite, in other words if ${\|x\|^2} \lt 0$ whenever $x \ne 0$.

In this case, we have these theorems:

*  A positive or negative inner product really is semidefinite (as the terminology implies).
*  Conversely, a semidefinite inner product is either positive or negative, at least if we use [[classical logic]].  (In [[constructive mathematics]], we can say that a semidefinite inner product is either positive or negative, indeed is positive [[xor]] negative, as long as it is nonzero in the sense that at least some $\lang{x,y}\rang$ is [[apart]] from zero.  And of course, the zero inner product is the only one that is both positive and negative.)
*  Hence, a definite inner product is either positive or negative definite.  (We can strengthen this to 'xor' and state it constructively if we assume that $V$ is nonzero in that there exists $x$ with $x \ne 0$.)
*  Conversely, an inner product is indefinite if and only if some norms are positive and some are negative.  (No constructive caveats here!)

Negative (semi)definite inner products behave very much like positive (semi)definite ones; you can turn one into the other by multiplying all inner products by $-1$.


The study of positive definite inner product spaces (hence essentially of all semidefinite inner product spaces over partially ordered fields) is essentially the study of [[Hilbert spaces]].  (For Hilbert spaces, one usually uses a [[topological field]], typically $\mathbb{C}$, and requires a completeness condition, but this does not effect the algebraic properties much.)  The study of indefinite inner product spaces is very different; see the [English Wikipedia article](http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Krein_space) on [[Krein space]]s for some of it.


All of this definiteness terminology may now be applied to an *[[linear operator|operator]]* $T$ on $V$, since $(x, y) \mapsto \langle{x, T y}\rangle$ is another inner product (on $\dom T$, if necessary).  See [[positive operator]].

* [[Hilbert spaces]] (over $\mathbb{C}$), for example $\mathbb{C}^n$;

## Definition

A **finitely complete category** is a [[category]] $C$ which admits all __[[finite limit]]s__, that is all [[limit|limits]] for any [[diagrams]] $F: J \to C$ with $J$ a [[finite category]].  Finitely complete categories are also called **lex categories**.  They are also called (at least by Johnstone in the [[Elephant]]) **[[cartesian categories]]**, although this term more often means a [[cartesian monoidal category]].

Small finitely complete categories form a [[2-category]], [[Lex]].

## Variants

There are several well known reductions of this concept to classes of special limits. For example, a category is finitely complete if and only if:

* It has a [[terminal object]] and admits all binary [[product|products]] and [[equalizer|equalizers]];
* It has a [[terminal object]] and admits all [[fibers]] and binary [[product|products]];
* It has a [[terminal object]] and admits all [[pullback|binary pullbacks]].

An appropriate notion of morphism between finitely complete categories $C$, $D$ is a left [[exact functor]], or a functor that preserves finite limits (also called a _lex_ functor, a _cartesian_ functor, or a _finitely continuous_ functor). A functor preserves finite limits if and only if:

* it preserves terminal objects, binary products, and equalizers;
* it preserves terminal objects, fibers, and binary products;
* it preserves terminal objects and binary pullbacks.

Since these conditions frequently come up individually, it may be worthwhile listing them separately: 

* $F: C \to D$ **preserves terminal objects** if $F(t_C)$ is terminal in $D$ whenever $t_C$ is terminal in $C$; 

* $F: C \to D$ **preserves binary products** if the pair of maps 
$$F(c) \stackrel{F(\pi_1)}{\leftarrow} F(c \times d) \stackrel{F(\pi_2)}{\to} F(d)$$ 
exhibits $F(c \times d)$ as a product of $F(c)$ and $F(d)$, where $\pi_1: c \times d \to c$ and $\pi_2: c \times d \to d$ are the product projections in $C$; 

* $F: C \to D$ **preserves equalizers** if the map 
$$F(i): F(e) \to F(c)$$ 
is the equalizer of $F(f), F(g): F(c) \stackrel{\to}{\to} F(d)$, whenever $i: e \to c$ is the equalizer of $f, g: c \stackrel{\to}{\to} d$ in $C$. 

## Properties

In any finitely complete category, the [[kernel pair]] of the [[identity morphism]] $id$ on an object $X$ is the [[diagonal morphism]] $(id,id)$ of $X$ and has a [[coequalizer]] [[isomorphic]] to $X$ itself.

## Idea

_Representation theory_ is concerned with the study of [[algebra|algebraic]] [[structures]] via their [[representations]]. This concerns notably [[groups]], directly or in their incarnation as [[group algebras]], [[Hopf algebras]] or [[Lie algebras]], and usually concerns [[linear algebra|linear]] [[representations]], hence [[modules]] of these structures. But more generally representation theory also studies [[representations]]/[[modules]]/[[actions]] of generalizations of such structures, such as [[coalgebras]] via their [[comodules]] etc.

See also at _[[geometric representation theory]]_.

## In homotopy type theory
 {#InHomotopyTypeTheory}

The fundamental concepts of representation theory have a particular natural formulation in  [[homotopy theory]] and in fact in [[homotopy type theory]], which also  refines it from the study of [[representations]] of [[groups]] to that of     [[∞-representations]] of [[∞-groups]]. This includes both [[discrete ∞-groups]] as well as [[geometric homotopy types]] such as [[smooth ∞-groups]], the higher analog of [[Lie groups]].

The key observation to this translation is that 

1. an [[∞-group]] $G$ is equivalently given by its [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ regarded with its canonical [[pointed object|point]] (see at [[looping and delooping]]), hence the universal $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] 

   $$
     \array{
        G &\longrightarrow& \ast
        \\
        && \downarrow
        \\
        && \mathbf{B}G
     }
   $$

1. an [[∞-action]] $\rho$ of $G$ on any [[geometric homotopy type]] $V$ is equivalently given by a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of the form

   $$
     \array{
        V &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& V//_\rho G
        \\
        && \downarrow
        \\
        && \mathbf{B}G
     }
     \,,
   $$

   hence by a $V$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]] over $\mathbf{B}G$ which is the $\rho$-[[associated ∞-bundle]] to the universal $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] (see at _[[∞-action]]_ for more on this).

Under this identification, the representation theory of $G$ is equivalently 

* the [[homotopy theory]] in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] over $\mathbf{B}G$;

* the [[homotopy type theory]] in the [[context]] of/[[dependent type theory|dependent on]] $\mathbf{B}G$. 

More in detail, this yields the following identifications:

## Definition

### In set theory

In [[set theory]], there are many ways to say that given the [[relation]] or [[correspondence]] $R$, $R(x, y)$ holds of elements $x \in A$ and $y \in B$. In [[allegorical set theories]] like [[SEAR]], it is a foundational concept. In [[categorical set theories]] like [[ETCS with elements]], we say that $R(x, y)$ holds of elements $x \in A$ and $y \in B$ if the ordered pair $(x, y)$ is in the [[image]] of the function $(p_1, p_2):R \to A \times B$. In [[material set theories]] like [[ZFC]], we say that $R(x, y)$ holds of elements $x \in A$ and $y \in B$ if the ordered pair $(x, y)$ is in $R$. 

In [[set theory]], a **one-to-one correspondence** is a [[relation]] or [[correspondence]] $R$ between sets $A$ and $B$ for which for every element $x \in A$, there is a unique element $y \in B$ such that $R(x, y)$ holds, and for every element $y \in B$, there is a unique element $x \in A$ such that $R(x, y)$ holds. Equivalently, it is an [[anafunction]] $R$ between sets $A$ and $B$ such that for every element $y \in B$, there is a unique element $x \in A$ such that $R(x, y)$ holds. 

### In type theory

In [[type theory]], given types $A$ and $B$, a **one-to-one correspondence** is a [[correspondence]] $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$ for which for every element $x:A$, the dependent type $\sum_{y:B} R(x, y)$ is a [[contractible type]], and for every element $y:B$, the dependent type $\sum_{x:A} R(x, y)$ is a [[contractible type]]. Equivalently, it is an [[anafunction]] $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$ such that for every element $y:B$, the dependent type $\sum_{x:A} R(x, y)$ is a [[contractible type]]. 

## Properties

By the [[principle of unique choice]], given every one-to-one correspondence, there is a [[bijection]] $f:A \cong B$. However, in the absence of the principle of unique choice, bijections and one-to-one correspondences are not necessarily the same; this is the same phenomena as the phenomena between [[functions]] and [[anafunctions]]. However, frequently in [[material set theories]], functions are defined to be anafunctions, and so bijections are similarly defined to be one-to-one correspondences. 

Something similar occurs in [[dependent type theory]], where by the [[principle of unique choice]], given every one-to-one correspondence, there is a function with contractible fibers $x:A \vdash f(x):B$, which becomes a bijection in the context of [[axiom K]] or [[uniqueness of identity proofs]]. However, in contrast to [[material set theory]], in dependent type theory, there is always a distinction between a function $x:A \vdash f(x):B$ and an anafunction $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$, and so there is always a distinction between a function with contractible fibers and a one-to-one correspondence.

## Definition 

Let $R$ be a [[discrete integral domain]]. We say that an element $r\in R$ is a _unit_ if it is [[invertible element|invertible]]. A non-unit is called _irreducible_ if it can not be represented as a product of two non-units. Note that then, $0$ is never irreducible, because it is a product of two non-units under the form $0 = 0.0$. It is often included in the definition of an irreducible element that it must be non-zero but this is in fact redudant. 

An integral domain $R$ is a __unique factorization domain__ (UFD for short) if every non-zero non-unit has a factorization $u = r_1 \cdots r_n$ (where $n \ge 1$) as product of irreducibles and this decomposition is unique up to renumbering and rescaling the irreducibles by units. 

Put differently: $R$ is a UFD precisely when the multiplicative monoid of nonzero [[principal ideals]] of $R$ (which is isomorphic to the quotient monoid $Can(R)/R^\times$, where $Can(R) \coloneqq R \backslash \{0\}$ denotes the [[multiplicative subset of cancellative elements]] in $R$ and $R^\times$ denotes the [[group of units]] in $R$) is a [[commutative monoid]] [[free object|freely generated]] by irreducible principal ideals. It follows that if $K$ is the [[field of fractions]] of $R$, then the [[quotient group]] $K^\times/R^\times$ is an abelian group that is freely generated by the set of cosets $f R^\times$ with $f$ ranging over irreducible elements. As a side remark, we observe that in this circumstance the exact sequence 

$$0 \to R^\times \to K^\times \to K^\times/R^\times \to 0$$ 

splits and there is an isomorphism $K^\times \cong R^\times \oplus (K^\times/R^\times)$ of abelian groups. 

## Examples 

* The ring of (rational) [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD. 

* A [[principal ideal domain]] (PID) is a UFD. (In particular, a [[Euclidean domain]] is a UFD.) As a partial converse, a [[Dedekind domain]] that is a UFD is a PID.  

* If $R$ is a UFD, then its [[polynomial]] ring $R[x]$ is also a UFD. 

* If $R$ is a UFD, then so is any [[localization]] $S^{-1} R$. 

* A [[regular local ring]] (for example, a [[discrete valuation]] ring) is a UFD. 

* If $R$ is a UFD and all of its localizations at primes are regular local rings, then the ring of [[formal power series]] $R[ [x] ]$ is a UFD. 

* For $D$ a positive integer, the [[algebraic integer|ring of integers]] in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ is a UFD iff $D$ is a *Heegner number*, namely one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163$. 

* If $R$ is not [[integral closure|integrally closed]], then it is not a UFD. 

## Properties 

* As noted above, a UFD is necessarily integrally closed. 

* The lattice of principal ideals under the inclusion order is a distributive lattice. 

* There is a useful characterization of UFDs by [[Irving Kaplansky]]:

\begin{proposition}
Let $R$ be an [[integral domain]]. Then, $R$ is a UFD iff every non-zero [[prime ideal]] contains a non-zero non-unit [[prime element]].
\end{proposition}

## Definition

An $n \times n$-[[matrix]] $U \in Mat(n, \mathbb{C})$ with entries in the [[complex numbers]] (for $n$ a [[natural number]]) is **unitary** if the following equivalent conditions hold

* it preserves the canonical [[inner product]] on $\mathbb{C}^n$;

* the operation $(-)^\dagger$ of [[transpose matrix|transposing]] it and then applying [[complex conjugation]] to all its entries takes it to its inverse:

  $$
    U^\dagger \;=\; U^{-1}
    \,.
  $$

  hence equivalently:

  $$
    U \cdot U^\dagger \;=\; \mathrm{I}
  $$

For fixed $n$, the unitary matrices under [[matrix product]] form a [[Lie group]]: the _[[unitary group]]_ $\mathrm{U}(n)$ (or other notations).

## In posets

### Idea

In the general context of [[posets]], an _interval_ is an [[under category]], [[over category]], or under-over category. They are closed under betweenness: if two points belong to an interval and a third point is between them, then that third point also belongs to the interval. 


### Definitions

Given a [[poset]] $P$ and an element $x$ of $P$, the __upwards unbounded interval__ $[x,\infty[$ (also $[x,\infty)$, $[x,\infty[_P$, etc) is the [[subset]]
$$ {[x, \infty[} = \{ y : P \;|\; x \leq y \} ;$$
the __downwards unbounded interval__ $]{-\infty}, x]$ (also $(-\infty,x]$, $]{-\infty},x]_P$, etc) is the subset
$$ ]{-\infty}, x] = \{ y : P \;|\; y \leq x \} ;$$
and given an element $y$ of $P$, the __bounded interval__ $[x,y]$ (also $[x,y]_P$) is the subset
$$ [x,y] = \{ z : P \;|\; x \leq z \leq y \} .$$

Thinking of $P$ as a [[category]] and subsets of $P$ as [[full subcategory|subcategories]], $[x,\infty[$ is the [[coslice category]] $(x/P)$, $]{-\infty},x]$ is the [[slice category]] $(P/x)$, and $[x,y]$ is the bislice category $(y/P/x)$.

An interval with distinct [[top]] and [[bottom]] element in a [[total order]] is also called a **linear interval**. (Sometimes this is called a **strict linear interval** and just "linear interval" then refers to the situation where top and bottom may coincide.)

Besides the __closed intervals__ above, we also have the __open intervals__

*  $ {]x, \infty[} = {[x,\infty[} \setminus \{x\} = \{ y : P \;|\; x \lt y \} ,$
*  $ {]{-\infty}, x[} = {]{-\infty}, x]} \setminus \{x\} = \{ y : P \;|\; y \lt x \} ,$
*  $ {]x, y[} = [x, y] \setminus \{x, y\} = \{ z : P \;|\; x \lt z \lt y \} ,$

as well as the __half-open intervals__

*  $ {[x,y[} = [x,y] \setminus \{y\} = \{ z : P \;|\; x \leq z \lt y \} ,$
*  $ ]x,y] = [x,y] \setminus \{x\} = \{ z : P \;|\; x \lt z \leq y \} .$

These are important in analysis, and more generally whenever the [[quasiorder]] $\lt$ is at least as important as the [[partial order]] $\leq$.


The entire poset $P$ is also considered an __unbounded interval__ in itself.


### Examples

#### Intervals in the real line

Intervals of [[real numbers]] are important in [[analysis]] and [[topology]]. They may be succinctly characterized as the [[connected space|connected]] [[subspaces]] of the real line. The bounded closed intervals in the real line are the original [[compact spaces]].

The interval in the reals has a [[universal property|universal]] characterization: it [is the terminal coalgebra](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/terminal+coalgebra+of+an+endofunctor#UnitInterval) of the [[endofunctor]] on the category of all intervales that glues an interval end-to-end to itself.

The __unit interval__ $[0,1]$ is primary in [[homotopy theory]]; specifically in [[topological homotopy theory]] a __[[left homotopy]]__ from a [[continuous function]] $f$ to a continuous function $g$ is a continuous function  $h \colon A \times I \to B$ out of the [[product topological space]] with the [[topological interval]] $I = [0,1]$ such that $h(x,0) = f(x)$ and $h(x,1) = g(x)$. More generally this is the concept of left homotopy for an [[interval object]] in a suitable ([[model category|model]]) [[category]].

The usual [[integral]] in ordinary calculus is done over an interval in the real line, a compact interval for a 'proper' integral, or any interval for an 'improper' integral.  The theory of [[Lebesgue measure]] removes this restriction and allows integrals over any [[measurable subset]] of the real line.  Still, the Lebesgue measure on intervals (even compact intervals) generates all of the rest.

To integrate a $1$-[[differential form|form]] on the real line requires orienting an interval; the standard orientation is from $x$ to $y$ in $[x,y]$.  If $x \gt y$, then $[x,y]$ (which by the definition above would be [[empty set|empty]]) may also be interpreted as $[y,x]$ with the reverse orientation.  This also matches the traditional notation for the integral.

### Properties

#### Classifying topos

The [[classifying topos]] for linear intervals is the category [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]]. See the section _[For intervals](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/classifying+topos#ForIntervals)_ at _[[classifying topos]]_.

#### Relation to simplices
 {#RelationToSimplices}

Let $\mathbb{I}$ be the category of _finite_ linear intervals. 

There is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  \widehat{(-)} : \Delta^{op} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbb{I}
$$

from the [[opposite category]] of the [[simplex category]] to $\mathbb{I}$.

Here

$$
  \widehat{[n]} \coloneqq Hom_{\Delta}([n],[1]) \simeq [n+1]
$$

and the inverse is

$$
  [n] \mapsto Hom_{\mathbb{I}}([n],[1])
  \,.
$$

See also at _[Simplex category -- Duality with intervals](simplex+category#DualityWithIntervals)_.

#### Intervals as generators of the incidence algebra

Recall that the [[incidence algebra]] $I(P)$ of a poset $P$ (relative to some commutative ring $R$) is an [[associative unital algebra]] containing all functions $f : P \times P \to R$ such that $x \nleq y$ implies $f(x,y) = 0$. For any pair of elements related by the order $x \leq y$, we can define an element $\epsilon_{x,y}$ of the incidence algebra by:
$$
\epsilon_{x,y}(u,v) = \begin{cases}1 & u = x, w = y \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$
and the collection of such functions $\epsilon_{x,y}$ form a [[basis]] of $I(P)$ as an $R$-[[module]].
So, the [[dimension]] of the incidence algebra $I(P)$ is equal to the total number of (non-empty) intervals in $P$.

Information about the number of intervals in a finite poset is also encoded in its [[zeta polynomial]].

## In homotopy theory

In [[homotopy theory]], "cellular" models for the intervals play a central role. See [[interval object]].

## In geometry

The [[geometry]] (for instance [[differential geometry]]) of intervals, for instance in the [[real line]], are often relevant. 

See for instance [Geometric spaces and their homotopy types](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+homotopy+type+theory#GeometricSpacesAndTheirHomotopyTypes) at [[cohesive homotopy type theory]].

## Idea

A differential form is a geometrical object on a [[manifold]] that can be integrated. A differential form $\omega$ is a [[section]] of the [[exterior algebra]] $\Lambda^* T^* X$ of a [[cotangent bundle]], which makes sense in many contexts (e.g. [[manifolds]], [[algebraic varieties]], [[analytic space]]s, ...). 

What we\'re actually describing here are the *exterior* differential forms; for more general concepts, see [[absolute differential form]] and [[cogerm differential form]].


## Definitions

### Standard definition

Given a differentiable [[manifold]] $X$, or even a [[generalized smooth space]] $X$ for which this definition makes sense, a __differential form__ on $X$ is a [[section]] of the [[exterior algebra]] of the [[cotangent bundle]] over $X$; sometimes one refers to an __exterior differential form__ to be more precise.  One often requires differential forms to be smooth, or at least continuous, but we will state this explicitly when we want it.  A __differential $p$-form__ on $X$ is a section of the $p$th [[exterior power]] of the cotangent bundle; the [[natural number]] $p \geq 0$ is the __rank__ of the form.  A general differential form is a $p$-indexed [[sequence]] of differential $p$-forms of which all but finitely many are zero; on a finite-dimensional manifold, this latter condition is automatic.


The _space_ $C^\infty\Omega^*(X)$ of *smooth* forms on $X$ may also be defined as the [[universal differential envelope]] of the space $C^\infty\Omega^0(X)$ of smooth functions on $X$ (which are the same as the smooth $0$-forms as defined above); more concretely:

It is generated by the smooth functions and three operations:

*  an associative binary operation of addition generalising the usual addition of functions,
*  an associative binary operation $\wedge$ (the __exterior product__ or __[[wedge product]]__) generalising the usual multiplication of functions,
*  a unary operation $\mathrm{d}$ (the __exterior derivative__, or __differential__);

subject to these identities:

*  addition makes $C^\infty\Omega^*(X)$ into an [[abelian monoid]],
*  both $\mathrm{d}$ and $\wedge$ distribute over addition,
*  $\mathrm{d}\mathrm{d}f = 0$,
*  $\mathrm{d}f \wedge \mathrm{d}f = 0$,
*  $\mathrm{d}(f \wedge \eta) = \mathrm{d}f \wedge \eta + f \wedge \mathrm{d}\eta$,
*  $\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{d}f \wedge \eta) + \mathrm{d}f \wedge \mathrm{d}\eta = 0$,

in which $f$ is a smooth function and $\eta$ is an arbitrary smooth form.  (Note that one often drops the '$\wedge$' after a $0$-form; thus, $f \eta = f \wedge \eta$.  There is hardly any ambiguity if one drops the '$\wedge$' entirely, but it\'s traditional.)

Although not directly stated, it can be proved that addition makes $C^\infty\Omega^*(X)$ into an [[abelian group]]; in fact, it is a [[module]] of the [[commutative ring]] of smooth functions on $X$.  This is further a [[graded module]], graded by the [[natural numbers]], with the elements of grade $p$ being the $p$-forms defined earlier; the space of these is $C^\infty\Omega^p(X)$.  If $\omega$ is a $p$-form and $\eta$ is a $q$-form, we have:

*  $\mathrm{d}\omega$ is a $(p+1)$-form,
*  $\omega \wedge \eta$ is a $(p+q)$-form.

The law
$$\mathrm{d}\mathrm{d}\eta = 0$$
holds for any form $\eta$, but the other laws become more complicated; if $\omega$ is a $p$-form and $\eta$ is a $q$-form, then we get

*  $\omega \wedge \omega = 0$ if $p$ is odd,
*  $\omega \wedge \eta = (-1)^{pq}\, \eta \wedge \omega$,
*  $\mathrm{d}(\omega \wedge \eta) = \mathrm{d}\omega \wedge \eta + (-1)^p\, \omega \wedge \mathrm{d}\eta$.

That is, $C^\infty\Omega^*(X)$ is a [[skew-commutative algebra]] over the ring of smooth functions, equipped with a [[derivation]] $\mathrm{d}$ of degree $1$.  In fact, the description above in terms of generators and relations makes it the [[free functor|free]] skew-commutative algebra over that ring equipped with such a derivation.  (Or if it doesn\'t, then it\'s because I left something out of that description.)

More general forms (in $\Omega^*(X)$) can be recovered as sums of terms, each of which is the wedge product of a function and a smooth form.  (This can also be seen as a special case of a vector-valued form as below.)  One can still define the exterior derivative of a $C^1$ (once continuously differentiable) form; in general, the differential of a $C^k$ form is a $C^{k-1}$ form.  If $X$ is not a smooth manifold but only $C^k$ for some $1 \leq k \lt \infty$, then one has to take more care here, but the definition of the skew-commutative algebra of $C^k$ differential forms can still be made to work.


Given local coordinates $(x^1, \ldots, x^n)$ on a patch $U$ in an $n$-dimensional manifold $X$, any differential form $\eta$ on $U$ can be expressed uniquely as a sum of $2^n$ terms
$$ \eta = \sum_I \eta_I \wedge \mathrm{d}x^I ,$$
where $I$ runs over *increasing* [[lists]] of indices from $(1,\ldots,n)$, each $\eta_I$ is a function on $U$ (continuous, smooth, etc according as $\eta$ is), and
$$ \mathrm{d}x^I = \mathrm{d}x^{I_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{I_p} $$
(for $p$ the length of the list $I$) is simply an abbreviation.  For a $p$-form, there are $\left(n \atop p\right)$ terms that appear.


### Twisted and vector-valued forms {#twisted}

Recall that a differential form on $X$ is a section of the exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle over $X$; call this bundle $\Lambda$.  Then given any [[vector bundle]] $V$ over $X$, a __$V$-valued form__ on $X$ is a section of the vector bundle $V \otimes \Lambda$.  The wedge product of a $V$-valued form and a $V'$-valued form is a $(V \otimes V')$-valued form, but if there is a commonly used multiplication map $V \otimes V' \to W$, then we may think of their wedge product as a $W$-valued form.

Of particular importance are $L$-valued forms when $L$ is a [[line bundle]]; these are also called __$L$-twisted forms__.  (Compare the notion of [[twisted form]] in a more general context.)  In local coordinates, a twisted form looks just like an ordinary form, once you choose a nonzero vector in $L$ as a basis.  Therefore, they can seem sneaky and confusing sometimes when you realise that they do not behave in the same way!

Let $\Psi$ be the [[pseudoscalar]] bundle, obtained as the bundle [[associated bundle|associated]] to the frame bundle by the character $\rho(A)=sgn(det(A))$. That is, a section of $\Psi$ (a pseudoscalar field) is given locally by a simple [[scalar]] field (a real-valued function) for each [[orientation]] of a local patch, with opposite orientations giving oppositely-signed scalars.  A $\Psi$-twisted form is called __pseudoform__.

On an $n$-dimensional manifold $X$, the bundle $\Lambda^n(X)=\Lambda^n(T^*M)$ is itself a line bundle, which is associated to the frame bundle by the character $A\mapsto det(A)^{-1}$; a $p$-form twisted by this line bundle is called a __densitised form__. Sometimes an $n$-form is itself called a __density__. As we will see under [integration](#integration) below, it is really an $n$-*pseudo*form (a section of the bundle $\Lambda^n\otimes\Psi$, which comes from the character $A\mapsto |\det(A)|^{-1}$) that should be called a density, but that is not the traditional terminology.

Given any real number $w$, the bundle $|\Lambda|^w$ associated to the character $A\mapsto |det A|^{-w}$ is called the line bundle of $w$-weighted scalars (also called [[density|$w$-densities]]); a form twisted by this line bundle is a __$w$-weighted form__. Note that $|\Lambda|^0=1$ is the trivial bundle, so a $0$-weighted form is just an ordinary form.
Also, an $n$-pseudoform turns out to be equivalent to a $1$-weighted scalar:
$$\Lambda^n \otimes \Psi \simeq |\Lambda|^1.$$
Since $\Psi\otimes\Psi=1$ is the trivial bundle, we have $\Lambda^n \simeq |\Lambda|^1 \otimes\Psi$, and thus a densitised form is equivalent to a $1$-weighted pseudoform:
$$\Lambda^k \otimes \Lambda^n \simeq \Lambda^k \otimes \Psi \otimes |\Lambda|^1$$

The bundle $\Lambda^n\otimes\Psi\simeq|\Lambda|^1$ of $n$-pseudoforms is the [[absolute value]] of the bundle of $n$-forms (that is of densitised $0$-forms), so we may take the absolute value of one of either and get one of the latter.  Similarly, the bundle of $0$-forms is the absolute value of the bundle $\Psi$ of pseudo-$0$-forms;
that is, the trivial bundle is the absolute value of the pseudoscalar bundle.


### As smooth functors on $n$-paths

One way to exhibit this statement nicely is:
+-- {: .standout}
A differential $n$-form on $X$ is a smooth $n$-[[n-functor|functor]] $P_n(X) \to \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$ from the [[path n-groupoid]] of $X$ to the $n$-fold [[delooping]] of the additive [[Lie group]] of real numbers.

+-- {: .query}
Urs, do you know where the need for orientation comes in here?  I don\'t follow it in enough detail to see, although I intend to read Moerdijk--Reyes.  ---Toby

[[Eric]]: I'm probably confused, but if $\sigma_n$ is a morphism in $P_n(X)$, then (unless $X$ is a [[directed space]]), the opposite $\sigma_n^{-1}$ is also in $P_n(X)$ and I think $\omega(\sigma_n) = -\omega(\sigma_n^{-1})$.

_Toby_:  Between Eric\'s comment here and Urs\'s at [[latest changes]], I\'m happy to remove this query box.

[[Eric]]: I think it is a good question. Maybe we should keep the query box here until the answer is incorporated in the page.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: here is my reply, that I originally posted at [[latest changes]]. I'll try to eventually work this into the main text of the entry

The orientation of the diffential form corresponds to the inherent orientation of [[k-morphism]]s: as we identify the differential form with a smooth functor on the [[path n-groupoid]], that [[path n-groupoid]] necessarily has _oriented_ $k$-volumes as its [[k-morphism]]s, simply because these $k$-morphisms need to come with information about their (higher categorical) source and target.

To get pseudo-differential forms that may be integrated also over non-oriented and possibly non-orientable manifolds one needs to consider parallel transport functors not with coefficients in just $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$ coming from the [[crossed complex]] 
     
$$
   (\mathbb{R} \to {*} \to \cdots \to {*})
$$

but the more refined crossed complex

$$
  (\mathbb{R} \to {*} \to \cdots \to \mathbb{Z}_2)
$$

where the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-factor acts by sign reversal on $\mathbb{R}$ (one can also use $U(1)$ instead of $\mathbb{R}$, this way $[P_n(-), \mathbf{B}^n U(1)]$ becomes the [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne complex]] and knows not just about differential forms but about $U(1)$ $n-1$-gerbes with connection even).

A little bit of discussion of this unoriented case is currently at [[orientifold]]. There for the case $n=2$.
=--

Note that an $n$-morphism in $P_n(X)$ is an oriented $n$-dimensional submanifold of $X$.

Such a functor (as described in more detail at [[connection on a bundle]]) assigns a real number to each parametrised $n$-dimensional cube of $X$, that is a subspace by a smooth map $\Sigma\colon [0,1]^n \to X$.  If the differential form that this $n$-functor defines is denoted $\omega \in \Omega^n(X)$, then this real number is denoted by the [[integration|integral]]
$$
  \int_{[0,1]^n} \Sigma^* \omega
  \,.
$$

This integral in turn encodes the $n$-functoriality of the $n$-functor: it effectively says that

* if we decompose the standard $n$-cube $[0,1]^n$ into $N^n$ little subcubes $(C_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}^n}$  for $N \in \mathbb{N}$
* and apply the $n$-functor to each of these to obtain a result (a real number) to be denoted $\omega(C_k)$;
* then by $n$-functoriality the result of the application of the functor to the full $\Sigma$ is the composition of all the $\omega(C_k)$ in $\mathbb{R}$. i.e. their sum
  $$
    \int_{[0,1]^n} \Sigma^* \omega
    =
    \sum_k \omega(C_k)
    \,.
  $$

Since one can let $N$ increase arbitrarily in this prescription -- $N \to \infty$ -- it follows that the value of the functor on $\Sigma$ is already determined by all its values on all "infinitesimal $n$-cubes" in some sense. 


The notion of **differential form** is the one that makes this precise: a differential form is a rule for assigning to each "infinitesimal $n$-cube" a number.

There are in turn different ways to make that last statement precise: 

* In [[differential geometry]] an "infinitesimal $n$-cube" is modeled by an $n$-tuple of [[tangent bundle|tangent vectors]] and a differential form is a fiberwise linear map from the $n$-fold exterior power of the [[tangent bundle]] to the real numbers, as given below.

* In [[synthetic differential geometry]] the statement is in essence the same one, but the difference is that there the notion of "infinitesimal $n$-cube" has a concrete meaning on the same footing of other $n$-cubes. If $D^n$ denotes the abstract infinitesimal $n$-cube in this context, then the mapping space $X^{D^n}$ of morphisms from $D^n\to X$ is the $n$-fold [[tangent bundle]] of $X$ and a differential form is precisely nothing but a morphism
  $$
    \omega\colon X^{D^n} \times D^n \to \mathbb{R}
  $$ 
  (where $\mathbb{R}$ is now the synthetic differential version of the real numbers) subject to three constraints. (These constraints can be seen as the infinitesimal analog of the $n$-functoriality discussed above).

  This is described in detail in section 4 of 

  * Moerdijk-Reyes, [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis]]

  For more on this see [[differential forms in synthetic differential geometry]].

### More general kinds of forms

While differential forms are usually restricted to the linear case, there are also more general kinds of "differential forms" which can be integrated.  See for instance [[absolute differential form]] and [[cogerm differential form]].

## Operations on differential forms

### Pulling back forms

Given manifolds $X$ and $Y$ and a [[continuously differentiable map]] $f\colon X \to Y$, any differential form $\eta$ on $Y$ defines a __pullback__ form $f^*(\eta)$ on $X$.  See at _[[pullback of differential forms]]_.

Thus, the operation that maps $X$ to $\Omega^*(X)$ extends to a [[contravariant functor]] $\Omega^*$.  Perhaps confusingly, forms are traditionally known in physics as 'covariant' concepts, because of how the components transform under a change of coordinates.  (Ultimately, this confusion goes back to that between active and passive [[coordinate transformation]]s.)

Note that twisted and (more general) vector-valued forms cannot be pulled back so easily.  One needs some extra structure on $f$ to do so; see the discussion of integration of $p$-pseudoforms at [[integration of differential forms]] for an example.


### Integration of forms {#integration}

Let $X$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold, and let $\omega$ be an $n$-pseudoform on $X$.  At least when $X$ is [[paracompact space|paracompact]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], we may turn $\omega$ into a [[measure]] on $X$ and thereby find its [[integral]].  Conversely, any [[absolutely continuous measure|absolutely continuous]] [[Radon measure]] on $X$ arises in this way from a unique $n$-pseudoform $\omega$.

If we wish to integrate untwisted (or differently twisted or vector-valued) forms and/or forms of smaller rank, then we may do so on [[submanifolds]] of $X$ equipped with some appropriate structure.  In particular, if $X$ itself is equipped with an [[orientation]], then $n$-pseudoforms on $X$ are the same as (untwisted) $n$-forms, and so we can integrate those on $X$.  See [[integration of differential forms]] for the general case.


+-- {: .query}
[[Zoran Škoda]]: Should maybe this entry have a discussion on heuristics behind the usual trick in supersymmetry which asserts that the inner hom for supermanifolds, gives the statement that the algebra of smooth differential forms on $M$ is the space of functions on the odd tangent bundle $\Pi T M$? I am not the most competent to do this succinctly enough... 

_Toby_:  Possibly that should go at [[differential forms on supermanifolds]]?

[[Zoran Škoda]]: By no means. Ordinary differential forms on ORDINARY manifolds are the same as functions on odd tangent bundle. I did not want to say anything about the generalization of differential forms on  supermanifolds. So it is NOT a different notion, but a different way to define it. If going to toposes hence synthetic framework is not separated why would be separated the equality which involves a parity trick...

_Toby_:  Ah, I see; your $M$ above need not be super, and it still works.  Then yes, that should be mentioned here too.
=--


### Cohomology of forms

There is a [[cohomology]] theory of smooth differential forms; we have a [[chain complex]]
$$ \cdots \stackrel{\mathrm{d}}\to C^\infty\Omega^2(X) \stackrel{\mathrm{d}}\to C^\infty\Omega^1(X) \stackrel{\mathrm{d}}\to C^\infty\Omega^0(X) \stackrel{\mathrm{d}}\to 0 ;$$
the [[chain cohomology]] of this complex is the __[[de Rham cohomology]]__ of $X$.

As smooth differential forms are the cochains in de Rham cohomolgy, the theory of integration of forms allows us to interpret [[relatively compact subspace|relatively compact]] oriented submanifolds as chains on $X$, giving us a [[homology]] theory.  Combining these, we have __[[Stokes's theorem]]__
$$ \int_{\partial{R}} \omega = \int_R \mathrm{d}\omega ,$$
where $\partial{R}$, which may be interpreted as the __boundary__ of $R$, is also called the __codifferential__ as it is dual to $\mathrm{d}$.

## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[group]]. For the following this is often assumed to be (though is not necessarily) an [[abelian group]]. Hence we write here the group operation with a plus-sign

$$
  + : G \times G \to G
  \,.
$$

For $\mathbb{N}$ the [[natural numbers]], there is a [[function]]

$$
  (-)\cdot (-) : \mathbb{N} \times G \to G
$$

which takes a group element $g$ to 

$$
  n \cdot g \coloneqq \underbrace{g + g + \cdots + g}_{n \; summands}
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A [[group]] $G$ is called **divisible** if for every [[natural number]] $n$ (hence for every [[integer]]) we have that for every element $g \in G$ there is an element $h \in G$ such that 

$$
  g = n \cdot h
  \,.
$$

=--

In other words, if for every $n$ the 'multiply by $n$' map $G \stackrel{n}{\to} G$ is a [[surjection]].

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $p$ a [[prime number]] a group is **$p$-divisible** if the above formula holds for all $n$ of the form $p^k$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

1.  $A$ is [[injective object]] in the the [[category]] [[Ab]] of [[abelian groups]] 

1. the [[hom functor]] $Hom_{Ab}(-,A) : Ab^{op} \to Ab$ is [[exact functor|exact]].

This is for instance in ([Tsit-YuenMoRi,Proposition 3.19] (#Tsit-YuenMoRi)). It follows for instance from using [[Baer's criterion]].

### Vector space structure

## Definition

In the most general sense, a **bundle** over an [[object]] $B$ in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is simply an object $E$ of $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a [[morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$ from $E$ to $B$:
$$ \array { E \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} \\ B } $$

One often refers to such a bundle simply as $E$, even though $B$ is really part of the data.

For $x \in B$ a [[generalized element]] of $B$, the [[fiber]] $E_x$ of the bundle over $x$ is the [[pullback]] $x^* E$.

Given two bundles $E_1$ and $E_2$ over $B$, then a _morphism of bundles over $B$_ is a [[morphism]] $E_1 \to E_2$ which makes this [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    E_1 && \longrightarrow && E_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_2}}
    \\
    && B 
  }
  \,.
$$

This way bundles over $B$ form a [[category]], also called the _[[slice category]]_ $\mathcal{C}_{/B}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ over $B$.


## Bundles with extra structure and properties

One generally considers bundles with extra properties or structure:


* [[fiber bundle]],

* [[microbundle]]

* [[principal bundle]]

* [[vector bundle]],

* [[connection on a bundle|bundle with connection]]

  * [[Simons-Sullivan structured bundle]]

* etc.

## The collection of all bundles

The category of bundles over a given object $B$ is the [[over category]] $\mathcal{C}/B$. The collection of all bundles in a given [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ therefore arranges itself into the [[codomain fibration]] $cod : [I,\mathcal{C}] \to \mathcal{C}$. As such, the [[descent]] for bundles may be expressed as [[monadic descent]] with respect to the codomain [[bifibration]]. This does in general not work inside one of the more restrictive subcategories of bundles with extra structure and property, as the push-forward operation typically does not respect these extra conditions. For more on this see [monadic descent of bundles](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monadic+descent#ForCodomainFibs).

## Idea

The concept of _isomorphism_ generalizes the concept of [[bijection]] from the category [[Set]] of [[sets]] to general [[categories]].

An _isomorphism_ is an invertible [[morphism]], hence a morphism with an [[inverse morphism]].

Two [[objects]] of a [[category]] are said to be _isomorphic_ if there exists an isomorphism between them. This means that they "are the same for all practical purposes" as long as one does not violate the [[principle of equivalence]].

But beware that two objects may be isomorphic by more than one isomorphism. In particular a single object may be isomorphic to itself by nontrivial isomorphisms other than the [[identity morphism]]. Frequently the particular choice of isomorphism matters.

Every isomorphism is in particular an [[epimorphism]] and a [[monomorphism]], but the converse need not hold.

Common jargon includes "is a mono" or "is monic" for "is a monomorphism", and "is an epi" or "is epic" for "is an epimorphism", and "is an iso" for "is an isomorphism".

[[Henri Poincaré]] wrote in [Poincaré 1908](#Poincaré1908) about isomorphisms:

> "It is scarcely credible, as Mach said, how much a well-chosen word can economize thought. I do not know whether or not I have said somewhere that mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things. We must so understand it. It is appropriate that things different in substance, but alike in form, should be put into the same mold, so to speak. When our language is well chosen, it is astonishing to see how all the demonstrations made upon some known fact immediately become applicable to many new facts. Nothing has to be changed, not even the words, since the names are the same in the new cases. There is an example, which comes at once to my mind; it is quaternions, upon which, however, I will not dwell.

> A word well chosen very often causes the disappearance of exceptions to rules as announced in their former forms; it was for this purpose that the terms 'negative quantities', 'imaginary quantities', 'infinite points', have been invented. And let us not forget that these exceptions are pernicious, for they conceal laws. Very well then, one of those marks by which we recognize the pregnancy of a result is in that it permits a happy innovation in our language. The mere fact is oftentimes without interest; it has been noted many times, but has rendered no service to science; it becomes of value only on that day when some happily advised thinker perceives a relationship, which he indicates and symbolizes by a word.

> The physicists also do it just the same way. They invented the term 'energy', a word of very great fertility, because through the elimination of exceptions it established a law; because it gave the same name to things different in substance, but alike in form.

> Among the words which have had this happy result, I will mention the 'group' and the 'invariant'. They make us perceive the gist of many mathematical demonstrations; they make us realize how often mathematicians of the past must have run across groups without recognizing them and how, believing these groups to be isolated things, they have found them to be in close relationship without knowing why. Today we would say that they were looking right in the face of isomorphic groups. We feel now that in a group the substance interests us but very little; it is the form alone which matters, and so, when we once know well a single group, then we know through it all the isomorphic groups; thanks to the words 'groups' and 'isomorphism', which sum in a few syllables this subtle law and make it at once familiar to us all, we take our step at once and in so doing economize all effort of thought."

##Definitions

An __isomorphism__, or __iso__ for short, is an invertible [[morphism]], i.e. a [[morphism]] with a 2-sided [[inverse]].  

A morphism could be called __isic__ (following the more common 'monic' and 'epic') if it is an isomorphism, but it\'s more common to simply call it _invertible_.  Two [[objects]] $x$ and $y$ are __isomorphic__ if there exists an isomorphism from $x$ to $y$ (or equivalently, from $y$ to $x$).  An __[[automorphism]]__ is an isomorphism from one object to itself.


## Properties

It is immediate that isomorphisms satisfy the [[two-out-of-three]] property. But they also satisfy [[two-out-of-six property]] satisfied by the [[weak equivalences]] in any [[homotopical category]].

Note that the [[inverse morphism]] of an isomorphism is an isomorphism, as is any [[identity morphism]] or [[composite]] of isomorphisms.  Thus, being isomorphic is an [[equivalence relation]] on objects.  The equivalence classes form the [[fundamental 0-groupoid]] of the category in question.

Every isomorphism is both a [[split monomorphism]] (and thus about any other kind of [[monomorphism]]) and a [[split epimorphism]] (and thus about any other kind of [[epimorphism]]).  In a [[balanced category]], every morphism that is both a [[monomorphism]] and an [[epimorphism]] is invertible, but this does not hold in general.  However, any monic [[regular epimorphism]] (or dually, any epic [[regular monomorphism]]) must be an isomorphism.

A [[groupoid]] is precisely a [[category]] in which every morphism is an isomorphism.  More generally, the [[core]] of any category $C$ is the [[subcategory]] consisting of all objects but only the isomorphisms; it is a kind of underlying groupoid of $C$.  In a similar way, the automorphisms of any given object $x$ form a [[group]], the [[automorphism group]] of $x$.

In [[n-category|higher categories]], isomorphisms generalise to [[equivalence]]s, which we expect to have only [[weak inverse]]s.

In the context of [[homotopy type theory]], for every [[morphism]] $f : hom_A(a,b)$ the [[type]] "f is an isomorphism" is a [[proposition]]. Therefore, for any $a,b:A$ the type $a \cong b$ is a set.
\begin{proof}
Suppose given $g:hom_A(b,a)$ and $\eta:1_a = g \circ f$ and $\epsilon : f \circ g = 1_b$, and similarly $g',\eta'$, and $\epsilon'$. We must show $(g,\eta,\epsilon)=(g',\eta', \epsilon')$. But since all hom-sets are sets, their identity types are mere propositions, so it suffices to show $g=g'$. For this we have $ g' = 1_{a} \circ g'= (g \circ f) \circ g' = g \circ (f \circ g') = g \circ 1_{b}= g$
\end{proof}

## Examples

*  A __[[bijection]]__ is an isomorphism in [[Set]].

*  A __[[homeomorphism]]__ is an isomorphism in [[Top]].

*  A __[[diffeomorphism]]__ is an isomorphism in [[Diff]].

* Every morphism in a [[groupoid]] is an isomorphism. 
  By definition of groupoid.

###### Example
**([[induced representation of the trivial representation]])**

Let $G$ be a [[finite group]] and $H \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} G$ a [[subgroup]]-inclusion. Then the [[induced representation]] in [[representation category|Rep(G)]] of the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[trivial representation]] $\mathbf{1} \in Rep(H)$ is the [[permutation representation]] $k[G/H]$ of the [[coset]] [[G-set]] $G/H$:

## Definition

A _maximal ideal_ (in say a [[commutative ring]] $R$) is an [[ideal]] $M$ which is maximal among [[proper ideals]]. (This is a second-order definition, as it quantifies over subsets of $R$.) 

Equivalently, an ideal $M \subseteq R$ is maximal if the [[quotient]] ring $R/M$ is a [[field]]. This suggests a [[first-order logic|first-order]] definition: an ideal $M$ is maximal if $\forall x \in R. \neg (x \in M) \Rightarrow \exists y \in R. x y = 1$. 

## Properties

### General

+-- {: .num_prop #EveryProperIdealisContainedInAMaximalOne}
###### Proposition
**(every proper ideal is contained in a maximal one)**

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] then:

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and let $I \subset R$ be a proper ideal. Then $R$ contains a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ containing $I$, i.e. $I \subset \mathfrak{m}$.

=--

(See also at _[[prime ideal theorem]]_.)

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $PropIdl(R)_{\subset}$ for the set of proper ideals of $R$, [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] by inclusion. We claim that every chain in $PropIdl(R)_{\subset}$ has an upper bound ([def.](#Zorn's+lemma#ChainAndUpperBound)). This then implies the statement by [[Zorn's lemma]] (equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]]).

To show the claim, assume that $\mathcal{C} \subset PropIdl(R)_{\subset}$ is a chain. We have to produce an $I \in PropIdl(R)$ such that for all $c \in C$ then $c \subset I$.

We claim that such $I$ is provided by the union:

$$
  I \coloneqq  \underset{J \in \mathcal{C}}{\cup} J
  \,.
$$

It is clear that if this is indeed a proper ideal, then it is an upper bound of the chain. 

To see first of all that this $I$ is an ideal, consider $x_1, x_2 \in I$. There are thus $J_1, J_2 \in \mathcal{C}$ with $x_1 \in J_1$ and $x_2 \in J_2$. Since a chain is [[totally ordered set|total order]] by definition, either $J_1 \subset J_2$ or $J_2 \subset J_1$. We may assume the former without restriction, otherwise rename $1 \leftrightarrow 2$. Therefore now $x_1, x_2 \in J_2$ and so we may add them there and find that $x_1 + x_2 \in J_2 \subset I$. Similarly if $r \in R$ then $r x_i \in J_2 \subset I$. 

Finally to see that this idea $I$ is indeed proper. But since all the $J_i$ are proper, neither of them contains $1 \in R$, and hence $I$ does not contain $1 \in R$.

+-- {: .num_prop #MaximalIdealsArePrimeIdeals}
###### Proposition

In [[classical mathematics]] then:

Every maximal ideal is a [[prime ideal]].

### Relation to points in the spectrum

Assuming [[axiom of choice|AC]] and [[excluded middle|EM]], then

Maximal ideals in the [[spectrum of a commutative ring]] $Spec(R)$ correspond precisely to the [[closed points]] in the [[Zariski topology]] on $Spec(R)$ ([this prop.](Zariski+topology#MaximalIdealsAreClosedPoints)).  

Closed points are at the heart of the definition of _[[schemes]]_. A scheme $X$ is a sheaf with respect to the [[Zariski topology]] that admits a covering by open embeddings of affine schemes, where "covering" means that every *closed* point $p: Spec(F) \to X$ ($F$ a *field*) factors through one of the embeddings.

## Definition

For $k$ a [[field]] and $V$ a [[free object|free]] $k$-[[vector space]], a __basis__ for $V$ is a [[basis of a free module]] for $V$ regarded as a [[free module]] over $k$. In [[functional analysis]], a basis in this sense is called a __Hamel basis__. 

## Properties

The [[basis theorem]] asserts that, with the [[axiom of choice]], every vector space admits a basis, hence that every [[module]] over a [[field]] is a [[free module]].

## Idea

A semigroup is like a [[monoid]] where there might not be an [[identity element]].  

The term "semigroup" is standard, but _semi-monoid_ would be more systematic.

## Definition

A __semigroup__ is, equivalently,

*  a [[set]] equipped with an [[associativity|associative]] binary operation.  

*  an associative [[magma]];

*  the [[hom-set]] of a [[semicategory]] with a single object.


## Properties

Some semigroups happen to be [[monoid]]s; even then, a semigroup [[homomorphism]] might not be a monoid homomorphism (because it might not preserve the identity element).  Nevertheless, semigroup [[isomorphisms]] must be monoid isomorphisms.  Thus, the identity element of a monoid forms a [[property-like structure]] on the underlying semigroup.

This should be contrasted with the phenomenon that a semigroup homomorphism between two semigroups that happens to be [[group]]s does, in fact, happen to be a group homomorphism, since in this special case one can show a semigroup homomorphism must preserve the identity and inverses.

As a monoid is a [[category]] with one object, so a semigroup is a [[semicategory]] with one object.

Any [[small category]] $\mathcal{C}$ can be thought of as a semigroup by defining $S = \text{Mor}(\mathcal{C})\cup \{0\}$ and taking $f*g = f \circ g$ for any composable morphisms $f, g$, and $f*g = 0$ otherwise. Then the semigroup $(S, *)$ fully describes $\mathcal{C}$. This type of semigroup is a [[weakly reductive semigroup]].

Generalizing this, any [[category]] can be thought of as a semigroup which isn't necessarily defined on a set.


## Attitudes toward semigroups 

Some mathematicians consider semigroups to be a case of [[centipede mathematics]].  [[category theory|Category theorists]] sometimes look with scorn on semigroups, because unlike a monoid, a semigroup is not an example of a [[category]].    

However, a semigroup can be promoted to a monoid by adjoining a new element and decreeing it to be the identity.  This gives a [[fully faithful functor]] from the category of semigroups to the category of monoids.  So, a semigroup can actually be seen as a monoid with extra property.

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Exercise  

Describe this property. 
=--

On the other hand, analysts run across semigroups often in the wild, and don\'t always want to add formal identities just to turn them into monoids.

Another variant with strong links with category theory is that of [[inverse semigroups]], which [[Charles Ehresmann]] showed were closely related to [[ordered groupoid]]s. Inverse semigroups naturally occur when considering partial symmetries of an object.

## Examples

* A left or right [[ideal in a monoid|ideal of a monoid ]] $M$ is a subsemigroup of $M$ and is only a submonoid if it contains the unit in which case it is $M$  itself. A monoid $M$ induces the [[topos]] of its right [[action]]s on sets - its right [[M-Set]] $= Set^{M^op}$. The set of all of $M$'s right ideals corresponds to the elements of  the [[subobject classifier|truth value object]], $\Omega$, of this topos. The analogous construction holds for left M-Sets  $= Set^{M}$ .

* The natural numbers with a binary operation $(-) +_n (-):\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ inductively defined as $0 +_n 0 = n$, $S(x) +_n y = S(x +_n y)$, and $x +_n S(y) = S(x +_n y)$ for all $x,y:\mathbb{N}$ is a commutative semigroup for all $n:\mathbb{N}$. 

## Internalization 

We can [[internalization|internalize]] the concept of semigroup in any [[monoidal category]] (or even [[multicategory]]) $V$ to get a __semigroup object__ in $V$.

## Idea

A [[vector space]] is _finite-dimensional_ if it admits a [[finite set|finite]] [[basis]]. The category [[FinVect]] of finite-dimensional vector spaces is of course the [[full subcategory]] of [[Vect]] whose objects are finite-dimensional. 

## Properties

### Compact closure
 {#CompactClosure}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A vector space $V$ is finite-dimensional precisely if the [[hom-functor]] $\hom(V, -): Vect \to Set$ preserves [[filtered colimits]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Every vector space $W$ is the  [[filtered colimit]] of the [[diagram]] of finite-dimensional subspaces $W' \subseteq W$ and inclusions between them; applying this to $W = V$, the condition that $\hom(V,-)$ preserves filtered colimits implies that the canonical comparison map 

$$colim_{fd\; V' \subseteq V} \hom(V, V') \to \hom(V, V)$$ 

is an [[isomorphism]], so some element $[f]$ in the colimit represented by $f: V \to V'$ gets mapped to $1_V$, i.e., $i \circ f = 1_V$ for some inclusion $i: V' \hookrightarrow V$. This implies $i$ is an isomorphism, so that $V$ is finite-dimensional. 

In the converse direction, observe that $\hom(V, -)$ has a [[right adjoint]] (and in particular preserves filtered colimits) if $V$ is finite-dimensional. 

To see this, first notice that the [[dual vector space]] $V^\ast$ of [[functionals]] $f: V \to k$ to the [[ground field]] is a [[dual object]] to $V$ in the [[monoidal category]] sense, so that there is a [[counit of an adjunction|counit]] $eva \colon V^\ast \otimes V \to k$ taking $f \otimes v \mapsto f(v)$. The [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] is uniquely determined from this counit and can be described using any basis $e_i$ of $V$ and dual basis $f_j$ as the map 

$$k \to V \otimes V^\ast$$ 

taking $1 \mapsto \sum_i e_i \otimes f_i$. We thus have an adjunction $(- \otimes_k V) \; \dashv (- \otimes V^\ast)$, which is [[mate|mated]] to an [[adjunction]] $\hom(V, -) \dashv \hom(V^\ast, -)$ by familiar hom-tensor adjunctions; thus $\hom(V, -)$ has a right adjoint.

This means that

###### Proposition

Finite-dimensional vector spaces are exactly the [[compact objects]] of [[Vect]] in the sense of [[locally presentable categories]], but also the compact = [[dualizable objects]] in the sense of [[monoidal category]] theory. In particular the category [[FinVect]] is a [[compact closed category]].

# Simple functions
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

Simple functions are (almost) the most basic notion of [[measurable function]] in [[measure theory]].  Given a [[measure]], it\'s easy to define the [[integral]] of a simple function, and we extend this to more general functions by continuity.


## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[measurable space]].  We may want $X$ to be equipped with some more data; if $X$ is a [[measure space]], then this is plenty of data.  However, for the most basic definitions, it\'s enough if $X$ is simply a measurable space.  This is the [[domain]] of our simple functions.

Another necessary datum is the simple functions\' [[codomain]] $K$, which we will eventually want to be at least a [[Banach space]] over the [[real numbers]].  (In the simplest example, $K$ is $\mathbb{R}$ itself, or perhaps the space $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]].)  We take $K$ to be a measurable space using its [[Borel sets]].

+-- {: .num_defn #trad}
###### Definition

A [[measurable function]] from $X$ to $K$ is __simple__ if its [[range]] is [[finite set|finite]].
=--

Since a simple function $f$ is measurable and a [[singleton subset|singleton]] is Borel, each [[fibre]] of $f$ is a [[measurable set]] in $X$; the function $f$ is given by the (finitely many) nonempty fibres and their (singleton) images.  This suggests another way to look at simple functions:

+-- {: .num_defn #lincomb}
###### Definition

A __simple function__ from $X$ to $K$ is a formal $K$-[[linear combination]] of [[measurable subsets]] of $X$.
=--

Here we identify a measurable set $A$ with its [[characteristic function]] $\chi_A$, so the formal linear combination $\sum_i c_i A_i$ is identified with the function $\sum_i c_i \chi_{A_i}$, which is measurable and whose range is contained in the finite set of sums of the $c_i$.  (If there are $n$ terms in the linear combination, then there are at most $2^n$ such sums.)

However, the na&#239;ve notion of equality of linear combinations is finer than equality of the corresponding functions, so we must combine Definition \ref{lincomb} with a definition of equality:

+-- {: .num_defn #equal}
###### Definition

Two simple functions from $X$ to $K$, in the sense of Definition \ref{lincomb}, are __equal__ if their corresponding [[functions]] from $X$ to $K$ are equal as functions.
=--

Then we have a [[canonical transformation|canonical]] [[bijection]] between the set of simple functions as in Definition \ref{trad} and the set of [[equivalence classes]] of simple functions as in Definition \ref{lincomb}.

Arguably, even this is not really the correct notion of equality, since functions may be equal for the purpose of integration without being literally equal.  If $X$ is equipped with a $\sigma$-[[sigma-ideal|ideal]] of [[null sets]] (or a $\delta$-[[delta-filter|filter]] of [[full sets]]), then we may consider a yet coarser notion of equality:

+-- {: .num_defn #almostequal}
###### Definition

Two simple functions, in the sense of either Definition \ref{trad} or Definition \ref{lincomb}, are __almost equal__ if they (or their corresponding functions) are [[almost equality|equal almost everywhere]].
=--

Sometimes, we wish to restrict attention to those simple functions which we expect to have a finite integral.  If $X$ is equipped with an [[ideal]] of [[bounded sets]] (which in a measure space are sets with finite measure), then we may do this:

+-- {: .num_defn #bounded}
###### Definition

A __simple function of bounded support__ is a simple function in the sense of Definition \ref{trad} such that the fibre over every non-zero number is bounded, or equivalently (in the sense of Definition \ref{lincomb}) a formal linear combination of bounded measurable sets.
=--

In some approaches to [[measure theory]], one *starts* with a $\delta$-[[delta-ring|ring]] of measurable sets, which may be reinterpreted as the bounded sets in the generated $\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]] of [[relatively measurable sets]], and then the simple functions will automatically have bounded support.

Finally, there is one more useful restriction (and slight generalisation) of simple functions, applicable when $K$ is ordered:

+-- {: .num_defn #positive}
###### Definition

A __positive simple function__ is a simple function in the sense of Definition \ref{trad} whose range is contained in the [[positive cone]] $K^+$ of $K$, or equivalently (in the sense of Definition \ref{lincomb}) a formal $K^+$-linear combination of measurable sets.  An __extended positive simple function__ (note the [[red herring]]) takes values in the [[extended positive cone]] $\bar{K}^+$, or equivalently is a $\bar{K}^+$-linear combination.
=--


## Integration

Let $X$ be equipped with a [[measure]] $\mu$, so $(X,\mu)$ is a [[measure space]].  (In particular, $X$ has the structure necessary for all of the definitions above, including both Definitions \ref{almostequal} and \ref{bounded}.)

If $f$ is a simple function from $X$ to $K$, then we wish to define the [[integral]] of $f$.  In general, this is a little tricky, but it\'s easy if $f$ either is [positive](#positive) or has [bounded support](#bounded).  It is easiest to write down the definition if we think of simple functions using Definition \ref{lincomb}.  Then we have:

+-- {: .num_defn #integral}
###### Definition

The __integral__ of the simple function $f$, represented by the linear combination $\sum_i c_i A_i$, is $\sum_i c_i \mu(A_i)$.
=--

+-- {: .num_prop #intpositive}
###### Proposition

The integral of a positive simple function always exists (but may be infinite).  It is finite if $\mu$ is a [[finite measure]], and it is positive (possibly $0$ or $\infty$) if $\mu$ is a [[positive measure]].  Also, if $\mu$ is positive, then the integral of an extended positive simple function always exists.
=--

(However, the integral of an extended positive simple function with respect to a finite positive measure need not be finite.)

+-- {: .num_prop #intbounded}
###### Proposition

The integral of a simple function with bounded support always exists and is finite (being a finite linear combination of finite numbers).
=--

+-- {: .num_prop #intequal}
###### Proposition

Two (positive or with bounded support) simple functions $f$ and $g$ are almost equal (with respect to $\mu$) if and only if the integral of $f - g$ is zero.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn #norm}
###### Definition

The __$L^1$-norm__ of a simple function is the integral of its pointwise norm (which is a positive simple function to $\mathbb{R}$) with respect to the [[absolute value]] of the measure $\mu$ (which is a positive measure):
$$ {\|f\|}_1 \coloneqq \int {\|f(x)\|} {|\mu(\mathrm{d}x)|} .$$
=--

In this context, we usually start with a positive measure $\mu$; in that case, of course, there is no need to bother taking the absolute value of $\mu$.

+-- {: .num_prop #NVS}
###### Proposition

The simple functions of bounded support form a [[normed vector space]] $Simp_c$ under the $L^1$-norm, if we consider them up to [almost equality](#almostequal).
=--

If we don\'t use almost equality, then we get in general only a [[seminorm]], but if we pass to a [[quotient space]] with a norm, then Proposition \ref{intequal} tells us that we are now using almost equality (and shows that Definition \ref{integral} is well defined when applied to Definition \ref{trad}).

+-- {: .num_defn #L1}
###### Definition

The [[complete space|completion]] of the normed vector space $Simp_c$ (under the $L^1$-norm) is the [[Banach space]] $L^1$ of __[[absolutely integrable functions]]__ (an example of a [[Lebesgue space]]).
=--

+-- {: .num_prop #integration}
###### Proposition

Taking the integral of a simple function of bounded support is a [[continuous linear functional]] on $Simp_c$, so it extends to all of $L^1$.
=--

In this way, we may define the integral of any absolutely integrable function.

+-- {: .query}
There might be some technical requirements for this to be true.  I\'ll try to check on that.

## Idea

The term 'bounded' has several meaning in different branches of mathematics.  For a general axiomatic approach to boundedness, see [[bornological set]].  Here we list definitions in various fields.


## In metric spaces

+-- {: .num_defn #metric}
###### Definition
Let $E$ be a [[metric space]].  A [[subset]] $B \subseteq E$ is **bounded** if there is some [[real number]] $r$ such that $d(x,y) \lt r$ for all $x, y \in B$.
=--

This generalises immediately to pseudometric spaces, quasimetric spaces, extended metric spaces, and most generally to [[Lawvere metric spaces]].

We can also generalise to [[gauge spaces]]:
+-- {: .num_defn #metric}
###### Definition
Let $E$ be a [[gauge space]].  A [[subset]] $B \subseteq E$ is **bounded** if there is some [[real number]] $r$ such that $d(x,y) \lt r$ for all $x, y \in B$ and all gauging distances $d$.
=--

This generalises immediately to quasigauge spaces.

The family of all bounded sets of a quasigauge space (and hence of the more particular kinds of spaces above) defines a [[bornology]] on its [[underlying set]].


## In topological vector spaces

+-- {: .num_defn #bset}
###### Definition
Let $E$ be a [[LCTVS]].  A subset $B \subseteq E$ is **bounded** if whenever $U \subseteq E$ is a [[neighbourhood]] of $0$ then there is some [[real number]] $r$ such that $B \subseteq r U$.
=--

The family of all bounded sets of a LCTVS defines a [[bornology]] on its [[underlying set]].

## Definition

Some authors do not require an integral domain to be [[commutative ring|commutative]]. However, on the nLab we require our integral domains to be commutative.

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], let $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$ be the [[monoid of regular elements]] in $R$, let $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$ be the [[complement]] of $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$, the set of [[zero divisors]] in $R$, and let $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ be the [[two-sided ideal]] generated by $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$. A commutative ring is non-trivial if $0 \neq 1$. 

\begin{definition}
An **integral domain** is a non-trivial [[commutative ring]] $R$ such that every [[element]] in $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ is equal to zero, or that the [[quotient ring]] $R/I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ is isomorphic to $R$. 
\end{definition}

Since every element of the ideal generated by the set of [[zero divisors]] is equal to zero, and the integral domain is a non-trivial ring, which means that there is at least one zero divisor, it follows that zero is a zero divisor and if $a \cdot b = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. It then follows that every integral domain is a [[reduced ring]]. 

The [[ring of fractions]] of every integral domain is a [[field]], the [[field of fractions]]. 

The ring of [[formal power series]] of an integral domain is a [[local integral domain]]. 

## Examples

* [[GCD domain]]
* [[Bezout domain]]
* [[unique factorization domain]]
* [[principal ideal domain]]
* [[Euclidean domain]]
* [[Dedekind domain]]
* [[field]]
* [[valuation ring]]

## In constructive mathematics

in constructive mathematics, there are different inequivalent ways to define an integral domain. The above definition is sometimes called a **ring without zero divisors**. Stronger notions include:

\begin{definition}
A **Heyting integral domain** is an integral domain which has a [[tight apartness relation]] and where every element apart from zero is regular. The [[ring of fractions]] of a Heyting integral domain is a [[Heyting field]]. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A **discrete integral domain** is a Heyting integral domain with decidable equality, or a Heyting integral domain where every element is either zero or regular. The [[ring of fractions]] of a discrete integral domain is a [[discrete field]]. 
\end{definition}

Rings without zero divisors and discrete integral domains are both definable in [[coherent logic]]. However, Heyting integral domains can only be defined in [[first-order logic]]. 

## Generalizations

Sometimes, one may want the trivial ring to be an integral domain, resulting in the notion of *[[possibly trivial integral domain]]*. In [LombardiQuitté2010](#LombardiQuitté2010), the authors define an integral domain to be a possibly trivial integral domain. 

In principle, one could just as easily consider a [[commutative rig]] or [[commutative semiring]] $R$.  In that case, however, only the definition involving the cancellative property extends to rigs and semirings. Furthermore, we should add the additional requirement that addition in $R$ is cancellable (that is, addition by any element is injective), to make the analogue of the previous paragraph correct. Since these could also be done for general [[domains]] to turn them into what could be called [[domain rigs]] and [[domain semirings]], these could be called *commutative domain rigs* or *commutative domain semirings*.

## Definition
 {#Definition}

Torsion and torsion-free classes of objects in an [[abelian category]] were introduced axiomatically as a [[torsion theory]] (or torsion pair) in ([Dickson 1963](#Dickson63)).

Beware that there are other, completely independent, concepts referred to as _[[torsion]]_. See there for more.

### In groups

The **torsion subgroup** of an [[abelian group]] $G \in $ [[Grp]] is the [[subgroup]] of all those [[elements]] $g \,\in\, G$, which have [[finite number|finite]] [[order]], i.e. those for which  some power is the [[neutral element]]
$$
  g \in G \;\text{is torsion}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
  \;\;\;
  g^n 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{
    n\; factors
  }{
    \underbrace{
      g \cdot g \cdots g
    }
  }
  \,=\, \mathrm{e}
  \,.
$$ 


A group is 

* *pure torsion* if it coincides with its torsion subgroup, 

* *torsion-free* if its torsion subgroup is [[trivial subgroup|trivial]].

Notice that for [[abelian groups]] $A \in $ [[AbGrp]] the group operation is often written additively, namely as "$+$" and the [[neutral element]] is written as zero, whence this reads:

$$
  a \in A \;\text{is torsion}
  \;\;\;\;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\;\;\;\;
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
  \;\;\;
  n \cdot a 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{
    n\; summands
  }{
    \underbrace{
      a + a \cdots + a
    }
  }
  \,=\, 0
  \,.
$$ 

### In monoids

The situation with monoids is very similar to the situation with groups. 

The **torsion subgroup** of a [[commutative monoid]] $M \in $ [[Mon]] is the [[submonoid]] of all those [[elements]] $m \,\in\, M$ for which some power is the [[neutral element]]
$$
  m \in M \;\text{is torsion}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
  \;\;\;
  m^n 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{
    n\; factors
  }{
    \underbrace{
      m \cdot m \cdots m
    }
  }
  \,=\, \mathrm{e}
  \,.
$$ 

Every such submonoid is a group, which is why the set of all such elements is called a torsion subgroup. 

A monoid is 

* *pure torsion* if it coincides with its torsion subgroup (and is thus the same as a pure torsion group), 

* *torsion-free* if its torsion subgroup is [[trivial subgroup|trivial]].

Notice that for [[commutative monoids]] $C \in $ [[CMon]], where the monoid operation is traditionally written as addition $+$ and the [[neutral element]] is written as zero, this reads:

$$
  c \in C \;\text{is torsion}
  \;\;\;\;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\;\;\;\;
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
  \;\;\;
  n \cdot c 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{
    n\; summands
  }{
    \underbrace{
      c + c \cdots + c
    }
  }
  \,=\, 0
  \,.
$$ 

### In modules 

Given a [[ring]] $R$, an element $m$ in an $R$-[[module]] $M$ is a **torsion element** if there is a nonzero element $r$ in $R$ such that $r m=0$. In [[constructive mathematics]], given a [[ring]] $R$ with a [[tight apartness relation]] $\#$, an element $m$ in an $R$-[[module]] $M$ is a **torsion element** if there is a element $r$ in $R$ such that $r \# 0$ and $r m=0$. 

A **[[torsion module]]** is a module whose elements are all torsion. A [[torsion-free module]] is a module whose elements are not torsion, other than $0$. 

## Properties

### Relation to the $Tor$-functor

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $A$ an [[abelian group]], its torsion subgroup is isomorphic to the value of the degree-1 [[Tor|Tor functor]] $Tor^\mathbb{Z}_1(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}, A)$. 

=--

See at _[Tor - relation to torsion subgroups](Tor#RelationToTorsionGroups)_ for more.

### Relation to flatness

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

An [[abelian group]] is torsion-free precisely if regarded as a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[module]] it is a [[flat module]].

=--

This is a special case of a [more general result](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/principal+ideal+domain#flat) for modules over a [[principal ideal domain]]. See also _[flat module - Examples](flat+module#Examples)_ for more. However, it is unclear whether this result holds in [[constructive mathematics]], since the $\mathbb{Z}$ is not a [[principal ideal domain]] unless [[excluded middle]] holds.

## Examples and applications  
 {#ExamplesAndApplications}

\begin{example}\label{FiniteGroupsArePureTorsion}
**(finite groups are pure torsion)**
\linebreak
Every [[finite group]] is pure torsion, hence is its own maximal torsion subgroup. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
**(tensoring with the rational numbers removes torsion subgroups)**
\linebreak
Given an [[abelian group]] $A$ which is pure torsion (e.g. a [[finite abelian group]], by Ex. \ref{FiniteGroupsArePureTorsion}), its [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor product]] with the additive group of [[rational numbers]] is the [[trivial group|trivial]] abelian group:

$$
  A \,\text{torsion}
  \;\;\;
  \Rightarrow
  \;\;\;
  A \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}
  \;\simeq\;
  0
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;
  AbGrp
  \,.
$$

Because, for $a \in A$ with
$\underset{ n\;summands }{\underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}} =  0$ and for
$p,q \in \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ with $q \neq 0$ we have, by the definition of [[tensor product of abelian groups]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    a \otimes \frac{p}{q}
    & \;=\; 
    a \otimes 
    \underset{n\; summands}{
    \underbrace{
      \Big(
       \frac{p}{n \cdot q} 
         + \frac{p}{n \cdot q} 
         + \cdot  +
          \frac{p}{n \cdot q} 
      \Big)
    }}
    \\
    & \;=\;
    \underset{n\;summands}{
    \underbrace{
      \Big(a \otimes \frac{p}{n \cdot q}\Big) 
      + \cdots + 
      \Big(a \otimes \frac{p}{n \cdot q}\Big) 
    }}
    \\
    & \;=\;
     \underset{
       n \; summands
     }{
     \underbrace{
       ( a + \cdots + a )
     }}
     \otimes 
     \frac{p}{n \cdot q}
    \\
    & \;=\;
    0 \otimes \frac{p}{n \cdot q}
    \\
    & \;=\; 0  
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

In [[rational homotopy theory]] one considers the higher [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_n(X)$ of [[topological spaces]] $X$ tensored over [[rational numbers|$\mathbb{Q}$]]: the resulting groups $\pi_n(X) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$ are then necessarily torsion-free -- in this sense [[rational homotopy theory]] studies spaces "up to torsion".
\end{example}

\begin{example}
**(torsion homotopy groups of spheres)**
\linebreak
  By the [[Serre finiteness theorem]], the [[homotopy groups of spheres]] are [[finite groups]], and hence pure torsion by Ex. \ref{FiniteGroupsArePureTorsion}, except in the degree of the dimension of the sphere and, for even-dimensional spheres, twice its dimension minus one:

  $$
    \pi_k\big( S^n \big)
    \;\;
    \simeq
    \;
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \mathbb{Z} & k = n
      \\
      \mathbb{Z} \oplus \text{torsion} & 
      k = 2n-1  \;\text{and}\; n\;\text{even} 
      \\
      \text{torsion} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{array}
    \right.
  $$
\end{example}

\begin{example}
**(torsion in elliptic curves)**
\linebreak
The torsion elements of an [[elliptic curve]] as a group are important in [[number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]]. See [[torsion points of an elliptic curve]].

## Idea

The _graph of a function_ $f : X \to Y$ is the subset that $f$ "carves out" of the [[cartesian product]] $X \times Y$.



## Definition 

### Graph of a function 

The traditional standard definition of a graph of a function is this:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

The __graph__ $graph(f)$ of a [[function]] $f: X \to Y$ is that [[subset]] $graph(f) \hookrightarrow X \times Y$ of the [[cartesian product]] $X \times Y$ defined by the property that $(a,b) \in X \times Y$ belongs to the graph of $f$ if and only if $f(a) = b$:

$$
  graph(f) = \{(a,b) \in X \times Y | f(a) = b\}
  \,.
$$

=--

This can be understood as a special case of a [[graph of a functor]] by the following observation

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

For $f : X \to Y$ a [[function]], define a function

$$
  \chi_f : X \times Y \to \{0,1\}
$$

by regarding a [[set]] as a [[0-category]] and a 0-category as a [[(-1)-category]]-[[enriched category]] and then setting

$$
  \chi_f : X \times Y \stackrel{=}{\to} X^{op} \times Y \stackrel{f^{op} \times Id}{\to} Y^{op} \times Y \stackrel{Hom}{\to} \{0,1\}
  \,.
$$

Then $\chi_f$ is the [[characteristic function]] of $graph(f)$ in that the diagram

$$
  \array{
     graph(f) &\to& {*}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X \times Y &\stackrel{\chi_f}{\to}& \{0,1\}
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] diagram.

=--
 
In other words this means that in the context of [[(-1)-category]]-[[enriched category theory]] the graph of a function $f$, regarded as an [[enriched functor]] is the [[category of elements]] of the corresponding [[profunctor]]. More on this at [[graph of a functor]].

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

It is  easy to identify the properties of those subsets of $X \times Y$ that are the graphs of functions, and $f = g$ if they have the same graph (given $X$ and $Y$).  Consequently, it is common, especially (but not only) in [[material set theory]], to *define* a function from $X$ to $Y$ as such a subset, that is to identify a function with its graph.  On the other hand, from a more categorial foundation, as discussed above, it\'s common to define a [[subset]] to be a [[characteristic function]]!

=--

### Graph of a binary relation 

More generally, we can say that the __graph__ of a [[binary relation]] from $X$ to $Y$ is a subset of $X \times Y$; $(a,b)$ belongs to the graph if and only if $a$ is related to $b$.  (Note that *every* subset of $X \times Y$ defines a unique relation; such a subset is the graph of a function if and only if the relation is both [[functional relation|functional]] and [[entire relation|entire]].)

Notice that with a function $f : X \to Y$ regarded as a [[profunctor]] $X \times Y \to (-1)Cat$ as described above, a relation $R \subset X \times Y$ corresponds to a general such [[profunctor]]. More precisely we have a [[pullback]] square

$$
  \array{
    R &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X \times Y &\stackrel{\chi_R}{\to}& \{0,1\}
  }
$$

where 

* $R \subset X \times Y$ is the relation $R$ regarded as a subset of $X \times Y$ in the traditional sense;

* $\chi_R : X \times Y \to \{0,1\}$ is the [[characteristic function]] of this subset.

So in this sense the ordinary notion of relation as a subset does really define the _graph of the relation_, while the relation itself is more naturally understood as the corresponding 0-[[profunctor]]/[[characteristic function]] $\chi_f$.


#### Relation to graph theory 

The graph of a binary relation from $X$ to $X$ is related to the notion of [[graph]] from [[graph theory]]; more precisely, such relations correspond to directed loop graphs (in the sense defined at [[graph]]) with vertex set $X$, and either can be defined as a subset of $X^2$.  In a similar way, [[spans]] from $X$ to $X$ correspond to [[digraph|directed pseudographs]] with vertex set $X$.

For the case of a relation from $X$ to $Y$ without $X = Y$, see under the cograph below.


### Graph of an $n$-ary relation 

The __graph__ of a [[relation]] of arbitrary arity is similarly a subset of an arbitrary [[cartesian product]]; see [[relation theory]] for more on this.


### Cograph of a function 
  {#cograph}

[[Bill Lawvere]] has also considered the __cograph__ of a function, which is dually a [[quotient set]] of the [[disjoint union]] $X \uplus Y$; $a$ is identified with $b$ if $f(a) = b$ (and additional identifications may follow).  However it may make more sense to define the cograph to be a quotient [[poset]] of (the discrete poset) $X \uplus Y$; we declare $a \lt b$ if $f(a) = b$ (and *no* additional relationships follow).  By regarding again a set as a [[0-category]], the latter notion of cograph is a special case of the notion of [[cograph of a functor]], as follows:

A function $f : X \to Y$ determines a [[functor]] $\bar f : I \to Set$ from the [[interval category]] $I = \mathbf{2} = \{a \to b\}$ to [[Set]] by setting $\bar f(a) = X$, $\bar f(b) = Y$ and $\bar f(a \to b) = f$.

Then let $cograph(f)$ be the corresponding [[category of elements]], given by the [[2-pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     cograph(f) &\to& {*}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     I &\stackrel{\bar f}{\to}& Set
  }
$$

which is computed by the strict [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     cograph(f) &\to& Set_{*}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     I &\stackrel{\bar f}{\to}& Set
  }
  \,.
$$

The cograph of $f$ in the sense of Lawvere is the set of [[connected component]]s of this category, i.e. $\pi_0(cograph(f))$.


#### Relation to graph theory 

The notion of cograph of a function may be even more related to the sense of [[graph]] in graph theory; although the identifications are not done there, the cograph draws a picture in which any relation (or [[multispan]]) of any arity becomes a directed graph (or directed multigraph) whose vertex set is the disjoint union of the relation\'s domains.  When the vertex set is broken up into a disjoint union in this way, graph theorists study this as _multipartite graphs_; in particular, directed bipartite graphs with vertex set broken up as $X + Y$ correspond precisely to binary relations from $X$ to $Y$.


## Generalization 

The notion of _graph of a function_ is a special case of the notion [[graph of a functor]] obtained for functors between [[0-category|0-categories]].

Accordingly, the notion of _cograph of a function_ is a special case of the notion of [[cograph of a functor]].

## Definition

In a [[category]] **associativity** is the condition that the two ways to use binary [[composition]] of [[morphisms]] to compose a sequence of three morphisms are _equal_ 

$$
  h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f
  \phantom{AAAA}
$$


<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/AssociativityDiagram.png" width="300">
</center>

$$
  \array{
    c_2 &\overset{ \phantom{AA}g\phantom{AA} }{\longrightarrow}& c_3
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\Big\uparrow 
      & \searrow^{\mathrlap{h \circ g}} & 
    \Big\downarrow{}^{\mathrlap{h}}
    \\
    c_1 &\underset{ (h \circ g) \circ f }{\longrightarrow}& c_4
  }
  \;\;\;\;=\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    c_2 &\overset{ \phantom{AA}g\phantom{AA} }{\longrightarrow}& c_3
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\Big\uparrow 
      & {}^{\mathllap{ g \circ f }}\nearrow & 
    \Big\downarrow{}^{\mathrlap{h}}
    \\
    c_1 &\underset{ h \circ (g \circ f) }{\longrightarrow}& c_4
  }
$$

If the category has a single [[object]] it is the [[delooping]] $\mathcal{B} A$ a [[monoid]] $A$, and then this condition is the _associativity_ condition on the binary operation of [[monoids]] such as [[groups]], [[rings]], [[algebras]], etc.

More generally, in [[higher category theory]], _associativity_ of composition of morphisms in an [[n-category]] means that the different ways to use binary composition for composing collections of [[k-morphisms]] form a [[contractible]] [[infinity-groupoid]]. This is a [[coherence law]].

For instance the associativity law in an [[A-infinity algebra]] is the special case of associativity in a 1-object [[A-infinity-category]].


## Examples

* See [[associahedron]].

* In a [[monoidal category]] associativity is the statement that the [[associator]] satisfies its [[coherence law]], which is true by a [[coherence theorem]].

## Idea

For $a$ a [[dualizable object]] in a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $C$ (or more generally an [[object]] in a [[traced monoidal category]]), there is a natural notion of the _trace_ of an [[endomorphism]] $f:a \to a$, which reproduces the ordinary notion of trace of a [[linear map]] of [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] [[vector spaces]] in [[linear algebra]] for the case that $C = Vect$.


## Definition


The idea of the trace operation is easily seen in [[string diagram]] notation: essentially one takes the endomorphism 
$a \stackrel{f}{\to} a$, "bends it around" using the duality and the symmetry and connects its output to its input.

$$
 \array{
   1 
   \\
   \;\;\;\downarrow^{tr(f)}
   \\
   1
 }
  \;\;\;
  :=
  \;\;\;
  \array{
     & 1
     \\
     & \downarrow
     \\
     a^* &\otimes& a
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Id_{a^*}}} && \;\;\downarrow^f
     \\
     a^* &\otimes& a
     \\
     & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{b_{a^*, a}}} 
     \\
     a &\otimes& a^*
     \\
     & \downarrow
     \\
     & 1     
  }
$$

This definition makes sense in any [[braided monoidal category]], but often in non-symmetric cases one wants instead a slightly modified version which requires the extra structure of a [[balanced monoidal category|balancing]].

The trace of the identity $1_a:a \to a$ is called the **[[dimension]]** or [[Euler characteristic]] of $a$.


## Examples

* $C = Vect$ with its standard monoidal structure ([[tensor product]] of vector spaces): in this case tr(f) is the usual trace of a linear map;

* $C = SuperVect = (Vect_{\mathbb{Z}_2}, \otimes, b)$, the category of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded vector spaces with the _non_trivial symmetric braiding which is $-1$ on two odd graded vector spaces: in this case the above is the **[[supertrace]]** on supervectorspaces, $str(V) = tr(V_{even}) - tr(V_odd)$.


* $C = Span(Top^{op})$: here the trace is the [[co-span co-trace]] which can be seen as describing the gluing of in/out boundaries of [[cobordism]]s 
 
* $C = Span(Grpd)$: this reproduces the notion of trace of a linear map within the interpretation of spans of groupoids as linear maps in the context of [[groupoidification]] and [[geometric function theory]], made explicit at [[span trace]]

* In the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of spectra]], the trace on the identity on a [[suspension spectrum]] of a [[manifold]] $X$ is the [[Euler characteristic]] of $X$ (see there).

## Generalizations

### Vertical categorification

See [[trace of a category]].

### Horizontal categorification

See [[trace in a bicategory]].

### Partial trace

Let $V \in C$ be a dualizable object, and $W$ any object. From an endomorphism $f$ of $V \otimes W$, one can produce an endomorphism $tr_V(f)$ of $W$, by applying the duality data of $V$. In terms of string diagrams, this is "bending along" the strand representing $V$.

+--{: .query}
TO DO: Draw the diagram just described.
=--

#### Matrix representation

Suppose $V$, $W$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field, with dimensions $m$ and $n$, respectively. For any space $A$ let $L(A)$ denote the space of linear operators on $A$. The __partial trace__ over $W$, Tr$_{W}$, is a mapping

$$
  T \in L(V \otimes W) \mapsto Tr_{W}(T) \in L(V).
$$

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
Let $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{m}$ and $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n}$ be bases for $V$ and $W$ respectively.  Then $T$ has a matrix representation $\{a_{k l,i j}\}$ where $1 \le k,i \le m$ and $1 \le l,j \le n$ relative to the basis of the space $V \otimes W$ given by $e_{k} \otimes f_{l}$.  Consider the sum

$$
  b_{k,i} = \sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{k j,i j}
$$

for $k,i$ over $1, \ldots, m$.  This gives the matrix $b_{k,i}$.  The associated linear operator on $V$ is independent of the choice of bases and is defined as the partial trace.
=--

#### Example

Consider a quantum system, $\rho$, in the presence of an environment, $\rho_{env}$.  Consider what is known in [[quantum information theory]] as the CNOT gate:

$$
  U={|00\rangle}{\langle 00|} + {|01\rangle}{\langle 01|} + {|11\rangle}{\langle 10|} + {|10\rangle}{\langle 11|}.
$$

Suppose our system has the simple state ${|1\rangle}{\langle 1|}$ and the environment has the simple state ${|0\rangle}{\langle 0|}$.  Then $\rho \otimes \rho_{env} = {|10\rangle}{\langle 10|}$.  In the quantum operation formalism we have

$$
  T(\rho) = \frac{1}{2}Tr_{env}U(\rho \otimes \rho_{env})U^{\dagger}
          = \frac{1}{2}Tr_{env}({|10\rangle}{\langle 10|} + {|11\rangle}{\langle 11|})
          = \frac{{|1\rangle}{\langle 1|}{\langle 0|0\rangle} + {|1\rangle}{\langle 1|}{\langle 1|1\rangle}}{2}
          = {|1\rangle}{\langle 1|}
$$

where we inserted the normalization factor $\frac{1}{2}$.

# Nilpotent groups
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

A [[group]] is __nilpotent__ if it can be built up by [[central extensions]] from [[abelian groups]].  A __central series__ for a group is a witness to its nilpotency.

More generally, we may speak about $\mathcal{A}$-nilpotent $\pi$-groups, for any class $\mathcal{A}$ of abelian groups and any group $\pi$ acting on our groups.  A group $G$ is equivalently an [[Ab]]-nilpotent $G$-group for its [[adjoint action]].


## Definition

### Nilpotent groups and central series

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The class of **nilpotent groups** is defined [[inductive definition|inductively]] by the following clauses:

1. The [[trivial group]] $1$ is nilpotent.

2. If $1\to G' \to G \to G''\to 1$ is a [[central extension]] (so that in particular, $G'$ is [[abelian group|abelian]]) and $G''$ is nilpotent, then $G$ is nilpotent.
=--

Phrased in this way, nilpotency is an inductive [[predicate]] on the class of groups.  If we regard the same clauses as defining an inductive [[family]] indexed over the class of groups, then we obtain the definition of a central series.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The set of **central series** for a group $G$ is defined [[inductive definition|inductively]] by the following clauses:

1. The trivial group $1$ has a specified central series, called the "trivial" one.

2. From any central extension $1\to G' \to G \to G''\to 1$ and any central series of $G''$, we obtain a central series of $G$, called an "extension" of the given one.
=--

Thus, central series are "witnesses" to nilpotency: a group is nilpotent if and only if it has some central series.

If we "expand out" the inductive definition of central series, and use the [[isomorphism theorems]], we see that it consists of a sequence of central extensions
$$ 1 \to G_1 \to G \to G/G_1 \to 1 $$
$$ 1 \to G_2/G_1 \to G/G_1 \to G/G_2 \to 1$$
$$ 1 \to G_3/G_2 \to G/G_2 \to G/G_3 \to 1$$
$$ \dots $$
$$ 1 \to G/G_{n-1} \to G/G_{n-1} \to 1 \to 1$$
and therefore a sequence of [[normal subgroups]]
$$ 1 = G_0 \trianglelefteq G_1 \trianglelefteq G_2 \trianglelefteq \dots \trianglelefteq G_{n-1} \trianglelefteq G_n = G $$
such that each $G_i/G_{i-1}$ is central in $G/G_{i-1}$.
This is the "usual" definition of central series.


### Nilpotency class

Every central series has a *length*, defined recursively by saying that the length of the trivial central series is $0$ and the length of an extension is one more than the length of the original.  The **nilpotency class** of a nilpotent group is the minimum length of all of its central series.

Proofs about nilpotent groups are often most naturally phrased using induction over the inductive definition of nilpotency.  However, probably due to widespread ignorance about inductive definitions, it is common to find them phrased instead using ordinary natural-number induction over the nilpotency class.


### Co-nilpotent groups and central streams

If we interpret the same defining clauses of nilpotent groups and central series [[coinductive definition|coinductively]] rather than inductively, we obtain notions that might be called *co-nilpotent groups* and *central streams* ("stream" being the standard name for the coinductive counterpart of a list).  Explicitly, a central stream is a descending countable sequence of normal subgroups, such that each successive quotient is central in the corresponding quotient of the whole group, that may or may not ever terminate with the trivial group.

In fact, *every* group admits some central stream and hence is co-nilpotent.  Two canonical central streams associated to any group are its [[lower central series]] and its [[upper central series]] (for now see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_series#Upper_central_series)). Despite the names, these two central streams are actually central series (i.e. they terminate at the trivial group) if and only if the group is nilpotent.


### $\mathcal{A}$-nilpotent $\pi$-groups

The following generalization of nilpotent groups is sometimes useful.  Let $\mathcal{A}$ be any class of [[abelian groups]] containing $0$, and let $\pi$ be any group.  By a *$\pi$-group* we mean a group with an action of $\pi$ (through group automorphisms, of course).

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The class of **$\mathcal{A}$-nilpotent** $\pi$-groups is defined [[inductive definition|inductively]] by the following clauses:

1. The trivial group $1$ is $\mathcal{A}$-nilpotent.

2. If $1\to G' \to G \to G''\to 1$ is a [[central extension]] of $\pi$-groups (i.e. a central extension whose maps are $\pi$-equivariant), and $G''$ is $\mathcal{A}$-nilpotent while $G'\in \mathcal{A}$ and $\pi$ acts trivially on $G'$, then $G$ is $\mathcal{A}$-nilpotent.
=--

A group $G$ is nilpotent in the original sense if and only if it is an $Ab$-nilpotent $G$-group with its [[adjoint action]].  If $\pi$ is nontrivial and/or $\mathcal{A}$ is strictly smaller than $Ab$, then the notion of $\mathcal{A}$-nilpotency can be nontrivial even for abelian groups (whereas every abelian group is obviously nilpotent in the ordinary sense).


## Properties

Every nilpotent group is an example of a [[solvable group]] (indeed, the groups in the [[lower central series]] of any group can be term-wise included into its [[derived series]]).

The [[Sylow p-subgroups]] of any nilpotent group are [[normal subgroup|normal]]. The direct product of these subgroups in such a group is its [[torsion subgroup]].

## Examples

Generally:

* Every [[abelian group]] is nilpotent.

* The [[direct product group]] of two nilpotent groups is again nilpotent.

* The [[central extension]] of any [[abelian group]] is nilpotent, a famous class of examples of such are the [[Heisenberg groups]].

Specifically:


* The multiplicative group of upper triangular unipotent $n \times n$ matrices with [[coefficients]] in any [[field]] is nilpotent.

# Measure spaces
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

In [[measure theory]], measure spaces are used in the general theory of measure and [[integration]], somewhat analogous to the role played by [[topological spaces]] in the study of continuity.

For the general theory of measure spaces, we first need a _[[measurable space]]_ $(X, \Sigma)$, that is a [[set]] equipped with a collection $\Sigma$ of __measurable sets__ complete under certain operations.  Then this becomes a measure space $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ by throwing in a [[function]] $\mu$ from $\Sigma$ to a space of values (such as the [[real line]]) that gets along with the set-theoretic operations that $\Sigma$ has.  If $E$ is a measurable set, then $\mu(E)$ is called the __measure__ of $E$ with respect to $\mu$.


## Notation {#notation}

The original notation for an [[integral]] (going back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]]) was
\[ \label{Leibniz} \int_a^b f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x \]
(where $f(x)$ would be replaced by some formula in the variable $x$).  In modern measure theory, we can now understand this as the integral of the [[measurable function]] $f$ on the [[interval]] $[a,b]$ relative to [[Lebesgue measure]].  If we wish to generalise from Lebesgue measure to an arbitrary measure $\mu$ and generalise from $[a,b]$ to an arbitrary measurable set $S$, then we can write
\[ \label{full} \int_{x\in{S}} f(x) \,\mu(\mathrm{d}x) \]
instead.  Now, if $f$ is not given by a formula but rather explicitly named, then there is no need for the dummy variable $x$, so we should write
\[ \label{simple} \int_S f \,\mu .\]
However, it has been more common to keep the symbol '$\mathrm{d}$' and write
\[ \label{excessive} \int_S f \,\mathrm{d}\mu .\]
(Note that '$\mathrm{d}$' can be read as 'with respect to' in both (eq:Leibniz) and (eq:excessive), although meaning different things; in the former case, it indicates the dummy variable, while in the latter case, it indicates the measure.)  This notation then leads to replacing (eq:full) with
\[ \label{switched} \int_{x\in{S}} f(x) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) .\]
This last notation, however, hides the fact that integrating a function with respect to a measure is a way of multiplying a function by a measure to get a new measure; the integral of $f$ on $S$ with respect to $\mu$ is simply the measure of $S$ with respect to $f \mu$, as can be seen in (eq:simple).  Compare also notation for [[Radon-Nikodym derivatives]].

It is also possible to take the entire expression '$\mathrm{d}\mu$' as the name of the measure, writing $\mathrm{d}\mu(A)$ even where the common notation is $\mu(A)$.  In that case, the common expression (eq:excessive) is literally the same as (what would otherwise be) (eq:simple), although (eq:switched) is not quite the same as (what would otherwise be) (eq:full).

We will use (eq:simple) below (although other forms may well be found on other pages).

See [Usenet discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math.research/browse_thread/thread/e28593bfd6b83aac/67a61d19e8f4d57f), and contrast (eq:switched) with the [Stieltjes integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieltjes_integral).  (The point is that it is $\mathrm{d}x$, not just $x$, that gives us the relevant measure in (eq:Leibniz).)  The notation (eq:simple) has also been used in an introductory graduate-level course by [[John Baez]].

There is also some variation in notation as to whether to use a roman '$\mathrm{d}$' or an italic '$\mathit{d}$'; roman is more common in England and italic in America.  But of course, that variation should not cause any difficulties!


## Definitions

A __measure space__ is a [[measurable space]] equipped with a measure.  There are many different kinds of measures; we start with the most specific and then consider generalisations.  The motivating example is [[Lebesgue measure]] on the [[unit interval]].


### Probability measures

Let $(X, \Sigma)$ be a measurable space.  A __[[probability measure]]__ on $X$ (due to [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]) is a [[function]] $\mu$ from the collection $\Sigma$ of measurable sets to the [[unit interval]] $[0,1]$ such that:

1.  The measure of the entire space is [[one]]:  $\mu(X) = 1$;
2.  Countable additivity:  $\mu(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} S_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(S_i)$ whenever the $S_i$ are mutually [[disjoint sets|disjoint]].

(Part of the latter condition is the requirement that the sum on the right-hand side must converge.)

It is sometimes stated (but in fact follows from the above) that:

*  Finitary additivity:  $\mu(S \cup T) = \mu(S) + \mu(T)$ whenever $S$ and $T$ are disjoint.
*  $\mu$ is increasing:  $\mu(A) \leq \mu(B)$ if $A \subseteq B$.
*  The measure of the [[empty set]] is [[zero]]:  $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$;

The first of these conditions will follow for all of the generalised notions of measure below, but the second usually will not. Related query discussion is archived [here](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=2829&Focus=28141#Comment_28141).

From now on, we drop the condition $\mu(X)=1$; the next step is to generalize the [[target]] of $\mu$, as follows:

*  Use $[0,\infty)$ (instead of $[0,1]$) for a (finite) __positive measure__.
*  Use $\mathbf{R} = {]{-\infty,\infty}[}$ for a (finite) __signed measure__ (alias __charge__).
*  Use $\mathbf{C}$ for a (finite) __complex-valued measure__.
*  Use an arbitrary [[topological vector space]] $V$ for a __vector-valued measure__.
*  In principle, one could go further yet; $V$ just needs an analogue of addition with a notion of infinitary sum (such as a [[topological abelian group]] has).  But until someone suggests a useful example, we will leave this to the [[centipede mathematics|centipedes]].

We define an __infinite measure__ by replacing the domain of $\mu$ by
an ideal $\Sigma'$ of $\Sigma$ such that the following
saturation condition is satisfied: if $\{S_i\}_{i\in I}$ is a disjoint
family of elements of $\Sigma'$ and $\sum_{i\in I}|\mu|(S_i)$ exists (and is finite),
then $\bigcup_{i\in I}S_i\in\Sigma'$.
The countable additivity condition should now be modified to require
$\bigcup_{i\in I}S_i\in\Sigma'$.

An infinite measure $\mu$ is __semifinite__ if for any $S\in\Sigma\setminus\Sigma'$
there is $T\in\Sigma'$ such that $T\subset S$ and $\mu(T)\gt0$.
The [[Radon-Nikodym theorem]] shows that semifinite complex-valued
measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to some fixed
[[localizable measure]] form a [[free module]] over the [[algebra]]
of complex-valued measurable functions (not necessarily bounded).

Some further terms:

*  We can combine conditions; for example a __finite positive measure__ takes values in ${[{0,\infty}[}$.
*  A measure is __bounded__ if, for some (finite) real number $M$, $|\mu(S)| \leq M$ for every measurable set $S$.  (This requires that the target of $\mu$ have a real-valued notion of absolute value or norm, so a vector-valued measure should be valued in a [[Banach space]] or something similar.)
*  A measure is __$\sigma$-finite__ if every measurable set is a union of countably many sets with finite measure.

Remarks:

*  The property that $\mu$ is increasing holds for all positive measures but may fail for others.
*  A positive measure $\mu$ that satisfies $\mu(X)=1$ must be a probability measure as defined earlier; that is, it satisfies $\mu(S) \leq 1$ for all $S$.
*  When $\infty$ is allowed as a value of $\mu$, then the requirement in (3) that the sum converges should be interpreted in this light; that is, the sum may diverge to infinity.  (For a positive measure, therefore, the convergence criterion is vacuous in [[classical mathematics]].)
*  Notice that $-\infty$ is not allowed as a value for a signed measure.  It would work just as well to allow $-\infty$ and forbid $\infty$.  It is even possible to allow both, but this is a little trickier (because of $-\infty + \infty$), so we deal with it later (at the end of this subsection).

Another possibility is to generalize the [[source]] of $\mu$; instead of using a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$, we could use a $\sigma$-ring or even a $\delta$-ring.  These versions are mostly more about changing the definition of [[measurable space]], so refer there for details of the definitions; however, we note that (3), when $\Sigma$ is a $\delta$-ring, should state that the left-hand side exists (that is, the union is measurable) if the right-hand side converges.  Generalizing $\Sigma$ in this way is complementary to generalizing the target above; in particular it may allow one to avoid dealing with $\infty$.  For example, while Lebesgue measure is only a positive measure on a $\sigma$-algebra, it is a *finite* positive measure on the $\delta$-ring of bounded measurable sets.  Indeed, every signed measure gives rise to finite measure on its $\delta$-ring of finitely measurable sets (as defined below); conversely, every $\sigma$-finite measure can be recovered from this by imposing (3) in all cases.

Yet another possibility is to drop countable additivity, replacing it with finite additivity.  The result is a __finitely additive measure__, sometimes called a __charge__ to avoid the [[red herring principle]]; in contrast, the usual sort of measure may be called __countably additive__.  For a charge, one could replace $\Sigma$ with an algebra (or even a ring) of sets; again see [[measurable space]] for these definitions.

Finally, an __extended measure__ takes values in the set $[-\infty,\infty]$ of [[extended real numbers]].  Here we have the problem that, even when considering finite additivity, we might have to add $\infty$ and $-\infty$.  While we might simply require that this never happens (so that at least one of $\mu(S)$ and $\mu(T)$ must be finite if they have opposite signs and $S \cap T = \empty$), this does not include some examples that we want (and in fact it would follow that $\infty$ and $-\infty$ cannot both be values of $\mu$ after all).  To deal with this, we define an extended measure to be a formal difference $\mu^+ - \mu^-$ of positive measures; $\mu(S) = \mu^+(S) - \mu^-(S)$ whenever this is not of the form $\infty - \infty$ and is otherwise undefined.  Note that the set of extended measures on $X$ is a [[quotient set]] of the set of pairs of positive measures; we say that $\mu = \nu$ if $\mu(S) = \nu(S)$ whenever either side is defined, that is if $\mu$ and $\nu$ are the same as [[partial functions]] from $\Sigma$ to $[-\infty,\infty]$.

Any extended measure restricts to an infinite signed measure, taking $\Sigma'\subset\Sigma$
to be the set of elements of $\Sigma$ with a finite measure.
Vice versa, an infinite signed measure $\mu$
canonically extends to an extended measure:
we can define $\mu_+$ and $\mu_-$ as usual and then take
the formal difference $\mu_+-\mu_-$.


### Constructive theory

In Henry Cheng\'s [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] theory of measure, the definition of [[measurable space]] becomes more complicated; the main point is that a single measurable set $S$ is replaced by a _complemented pair_ $(S,T)$.  Once that is understood, very little needs to be changed to define a measure space.

In the requirements (1--3), the constants $\empty$ and $X$ and the operation $\union$ are interpreted by formal [[de Morgan duality]], as explained at [[Cheng measurable space]].  The convergence requirement in (3) should be interpreted in the strong sense of located convergence and is no longer trivial for positive measures.  We must add a further requirement to enforce the idea that $\mu(S,T)$ is the measure of $S$ alone, as follows:

*  $\mu(S,T) = \mu(S,U)$ whenever $(S,T)$ and $(S,U)$ are both complemented pairs.

In general, a _measurable set_ is any set $S$ such that $(S,T)$ is a complemented pair for some set $T$; the term 'measurable set' in the classical theory should be interpreted as either 'mesurable set' or 'complemented pair' in the constructive theory, depending on context.  Usually both interpretations will actually work, but often only the first set of the pair will matter, thanks to the axiom above.

We will mention other occasional fine points in the constructive theory when they occur; the main outline does not change.

### Measures on a $\sigma$-frame

In measure theory, a __measure__ on a [[sigma-frame|$\sigma$-frame]] or more generally a [[sigma-complete lattice|$\sigma$-complete]] [[distributive lattice]] $(L, \leq, \bot, \vee, \top, \wedge, \Vee)$ is a [[valuation (measure theory)|valuation]] $\mu:L \to [0, \infty]$ such that the elements are mutually disjoint and the probability valuation is denumerably/countably additive
$$\forall s\in L^\mathbb{N}. \forall m \in \mathbb{N}. \forall n \in \mathbb{N}. (m \neq n) \wedge (s(m) \wedge s(n) = \bot)$$
$$\forall s\in L^\mathbb{N}. \mu(\Vee_{n:\mathbb{N}} s(n)) = \sum_{n:\mathbb{N}} \mu(s(n))$$

### Subsidiary definitions

Given a measure space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$, a __$\mu$-null $\Sigma$-measurable set__ is a measurable set $N$ such that $\mu(S) = 0$ whenever $S \subseteq N$ is measurable; a __$\mu$-[[null set]]__ is any subset of a null measurable set.  In a positive measure space, we don\'t have to bother with $S$; $N$ will be a null measurable set as long as $\mu(N) = 0$.

A __$\mu$-full $\Sigma$-measurable set__ is a measurable set $F$ such that $\mu(S) = \mu(S \cap F)$ for every measurable set $S$; a __$\mu$-[[full set]]__ is any superset of a full measurable set.  In a probability measure space, we don\'t have to bother with $S$; $F$ will be a full measurable set as long as $\mu(F) = 1$.  Classically, a full set is precisely the [[complement]] of a null set, but this doesn\'t hold in the constructive theory.

A property of elements of $X$ holds __$\mu$-almost everywhere__ if the set of values where it holds is full.

A measure is __complete__ if every full set is measurable.  We may form the __completion__ of a measure space by accepting as a measurable set the intersection of any set and a full set; these __$\mu$-measurable sets__ will automatically form a $\sigma$-algebra (or whatever $\Sigma$ originally was).  Classically, a measure is complete if and only if every null set is measurable and a set is $\mu$-measurable if and only if it is the [[symmetric difference]] between a measurable set and a null set.

A __finitely $\mu$-measurable set__ is a measurable set $M$ such that $\mu(S)$ is finite whenever $S \subseteq M$ is measurable; a __$\sigma$-finitely $\mu$-measurable set__ is any union of countably many finitely measurable sets.  Again, we don\'t have to bother with $S$ in a positive measure space.  Note that a measure space is ($\sigma$)-finite if and only if every measurable set is ($\sigma$)-finitely measurable.  The finitely measurable sets form a $\delta$-ring, and the $\sigma$-finitely measurable sets form a $\sigma$-ring.

Recall that a $\Sigma$-[[measurable function]] from $(X,\Sigma)$ to some other measurable space is any function $f$ such that the [[preimage]] under $f$ of a measurable set is always measurable (or something more complicated in the constructive theory).  Now that we have a measure space, let a __$\mu$-measurable function__ be a [[partial function]] $f$ from $X$ to some other measurable space such that the domain of $f$ is full and the preimage under $f$ of a measurable set is always $\mu$-measurable (that is measurable in the completion of $\mu$), and let two such functions be __$\mu$-equivalent__ if their [[equaliser]] is a full set.  We are really interested in the [[quotient set]] under this equivalence and so identify equivalent $\mu$-measurable functions.  Classically, every $\mu$-measurable function is equivalent to some (total) $\Sigma$-measurable function, so the definition is simpler in that case; however, partial functions still come up naturally in the classical theory, so it can be convenient to allow them rather than (as is usually done in a rigorous treatment) systematically replacing them with total functions.

A __$\mu$-integrable function__ is a $\mu$-measurable function $f$ such that the integral $\int_S f \,\mu$ (as defined below) exists for every measurable set $S$; it is enough to check $S = X$.  Equivalently, we may say that it is a $\mu$-measurable function $f$ such that the extended measure $f \mu$ (also defined below) is actually a finite measure.  (In any case, we get a finite measure $f \mu$ if $f$ is integrable.)


### Integration

In the following, 'measurable' will mean $\mu$-measurable.  That is, we assume that $\mu$ is complete and identify $\mu$-equivalent functions.  We will also assume that $\mu$ is a positive measure until I make sure of what must be done to generalise.

Given a measure $\mu$, a measurable set $S$, and a measurable function $f$, we will define the integral
$$ \int_S f \,\mu $$
(see [above](#notation) for variations in notation) in stages, from the simplest form of $f$ to the most arbitrary.

Each measurable subset $S \subseteq X$ induces a measurable [[characteristic function]] $\chi_S\colon X \to \mathbb{R}_+$ where $\chi_S(x) = 1$ if $x \in S$, $\chi_S(x) = 0$ if $x \in \neg{S}$.  (In the constructive theory, where $S$ is a complemented pair, $\chi_S$ is a partial function with a full domain, so $\chi_S f$ is still a measurable function as defined above.)  In general, we have
$$ \int_S f \,\mu = \int_X \chi_S f \,\mu ,$$
so from now on we will assume that we are integrating over all of $X$ (and drop the subscript).

A positive __[[simple function]]__ is a finite $\mathbb{R}_+$-linear combination of measurable characteristic functions; the first form of integral that we define is
$$ \int \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} a_i \chi_{S_i} \,\mu = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} a_i \mu(S_i) .$$ 

The integral is extended to all measurable functions $f\colon X \to [0, \infty]$ by the rule 
$$ \int f \,\mu = \sup \{ \int s \,\mu \;|\; 0 \leq s \leq f, s\; simple \} $$
if this [[supremum]] converges.  Classically, the integral either converges or diverges to infinity, so $\int f \,\mu$ exists in some sense in any case; the possibilities are more complicated constructively.

For any measurable function $f\colon X \to [-\infty, \infty]$, define $f_+$ and $f_{-}$ by 
$$ f_+(x) = \max\{f(x), 0\}, \qquad f_{-}(x) = \max\{-f(x), 0\} $$ 
so that $f = f_+ - f_{-}$, ${|f|} = f_+ + f_{-}$.  Then the final definition is
$$ \int f \,\mu = \int f_{+} \,\mu - \int f_{-} \,\mu $$
if both integrals on the right converge.  Classically, the other possibilities are $\infty$, $-\infty$, and $\infty - \infty$; not much can be done with the latter.

A measurable function $f$ is **integrable** with respect to $\mu$ if this integral converges.  It can be proved that all of the definitions above are consistent; that is, if the final definition is applied to a simple function, then it agrees with the original definition.


If $f$ takes values in the field $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]] or in some more general [[Banach space]] $V$, then we can still ask whether ${|f|}$ is integrable.  If it is, then we say that $f$ is __absolutely integrable__.  We can then define the integral of $f$; we always have
$$ {\|\int f \,\mu\|} \leq \int {\|f\|} \,\mu .$$
This integral is easy to define if $V$ has a basis; for example, a measurable complex-valued function $f\colon X \to \mathbb{C}$ is integrable iff both its real and imaginary parts are integrable, and we have
$$ \int f \,\mu = \int \Re{f} \,\mu + \mathrm{i} \int \Im{f} \,\mu .$$

+-- {: .query}
I need to check [[HAF]] for more details here in the general case.  In particular, something can be integrable without being absolutely integrable (although not if it\'s complex-valued, of course) or indeed even without being valued in a (pseudo)normed space.
=--

The vector space of $V$-valued integrable functions is itself a Banach space, using the norm
$$ {\|f\|_1} \coloneqq \int {\|f\|} \,\mu .$$
Note that we must use the notion of measurable function as an equivalence class of functions to get a Banach space here; otherwise we have only a pre-Banach space (that is, a complete pseudonormed vector space).

This Banach space is called a __[[Lebesgue space]]__ and is denoted $L^1(\mu,V)$, $L^1(X,V)$, or just $L^1$, depending on context.  The default value of $V$ is usually either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, depending on the author.  More general Lebesgue spaces of the form $L^p$ also exist; $f$ is in $L^p$ precisely when ${|f|^p}$ is integrable, and we use
$$ {\|f\|_p} \coloneqq \root p {\int {\|f\|^p} \,\mu} $$
as the norm.  (At least, this is so for $p \in {]{0,\infty}[}$; see [[Lebesgue space]] for generalizations to other values of $p$.)


## The algebra of measures

Note that
$$ (f \mu) (S) = \int \chi_S f \,\mu $$
makes $f \mu$ into a $V$-valued measure whenever $f$ is an integrable $V$-valued function.  When $f$ is $[-\infty,\infty]$-valued and $\mu$ is a signed measure, then $f$ is an extended measure which is finite iff $f$ is integrable.  We have
$$ (f g) \mu = f (g \mu) .$$
Thus integration can be seen as a way of multiplying a function by a measure to get another measure.

The [[Radon-Nikodym derivative]] is about reversing this (dividing two measures to get a function).

Other topics: absolute continuity, etc.  (Refer to &lt;http://tobybartels.name/notes/#Radon>.)


## Noncommutative measure theory

Every commutative [[von Neumann algebra]] is isomorphic to the [[Lebesgue space]] $L^\infty(X,\mu)$ where $\mu$ is some measure (which is irrelevant) on a [[localisable measurable space]], and this extends to a [[dual category|duality]] between localisable measurable spaces and commutative von Neumann algebras.  This is similar to the correspondence between commutative $C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebras]] and [[locally compact Hausdorff space]]s, which is the central approach to [[noncommutative geometry]].  It is useful to exploit the intuition that the theory of (noncommutative) von Neumann algebras is a noncommutative analogue of classical measure theory.

## Definition

For a [[finite set]] $X$, a _cyclic permutation_ on $X$ is a [[permutation]] $\sigma \colon X \to X$ such that the induced [[group homomorphism]] $\mathbb{Z} \to Aut(X)$ from the [[integers]] to the [[automorphism group]]  (i.e. the [[symmetric group]]) of $X$, sending $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ to $\sigma^n$, defines a [[transitive action]]. 

One may visualize the elements of $X$ as points arranged on a [[circle]] spaced equally apart, with $\sigma(x)$ the next-door neighbor of $x$ in the counterclockwise direction, hence the name.

## Idea

A **tree** is a connected [[graph]] without cycles. Some notions of tree (such as planar tree) consider extra structure or properties as well, but the baseline notion is tree as acyclic connected graph. 

Trees are fundamental combinatorial objects which appear in a wide variety of guises. Some are given below. 


## Definitions 

### As undirected graphs 

Recall that an [[undirected graph]] $G$ consists of a set $V$ of _vertices_ and a set $E$ of unordered pairs of vertices. A **path** in $G$ is a finite sequence of vertices $x_0, \ldots, x_n$ such that each pair $x_i x_{i+1}$ belongs to $E$. If $x_n = x_0$, then the path is called a **cycle**. A graph is **connected** if it is nonempty and if for every distinct pair of vertices $x, y$, there is a path for which $x_0 = x$ and $x_n = y$. A graph is **acyclic** if the only cycles are paths 

$$x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n, x_{n-1}, \ldots, x_0$$ 

where steps are retraced; an acyclic graph is also called a _forest_. A **tree** is a connected forest. 

Each forest is a [[disjoint union|disjoint sum]] (a [[coproduct]] in the category of graphs) of trees. Removal of a vertex of a tree (and any edges incident to it) results in a forest. 

Not all authors include nonemptiness as part of the notion of connectedness. See [[connected space]] for commentary on this. Forests on the other hand may be empty. 


### As spaces 

A _topological tree_ is a 1-dimensional [[CW-complex]] which is contractible, i.e., homotopy equivalent to a point. 

In this language, a topological graph is simply a 1-dimensional CW-complex; more precisely, we mean a _CW-presentation_ and not merely a space that can be so presented. A topological forest is then a 1-dimensional CW-complex with vanishing first [[homology group]] with integral coefficients, and a tree is a connected forest. 

For finite graphs $G$ as CW-complexes, one has the useful [[Euler characteristic|Euler formula]]: 

$$h_0 - h_1 = c_0 - c_1$$ 

where $c_i$ is the number of $i$-cells and $h_i$ is the rank of the homology group $H_i(G; \mathbb{Z})$. This gives a useful criterion for a graph to be a tree: that it be connected ($h_0 = 1$) and that the number of vertices $c_0$ be 1 greater than the number of edges $c_1$. 


### As digraphs

A **rooted tree** is a [[directed graph]] (or [[quiver]]) $G$ such that the [[free category on a quiver|free category]] generated by $G$ has a [[terminal object]], called the **root** of $G$. (Thus for every vertex $x$ in $G$ there is exactly one directed path from $x$ to the root. It follows easily that the free category is a poset. There is no significant change in content if "terminal" here is replaced by "initial"; we can distinguish the conventions by a tree directed _towards_ the root rather than _away from_ the root.) 

A **rooted forest** is a coproduct of rooted trees, and again we have the fundamental fact that there is a natural [[equivalence of categories]] 

$$Tree \overset{\to}{\leftarrow} Forest$$ 

which in one direction is the functor which sends a tree to the forest which results by excising the root and all edges incident to it, and in the other sends a forest to the tree gotten by adjoining a new root and joining the roots of the forest to that new root by new edges. 

This equivalence can be exploited to relate the [[exponential generating function]] for finite rooted trees to the [[Lambert W-function]] (q.v.). 

A tree in the form of an _undirected_ graph together with a chosen vertex can be regarded as a rooted tree in digraph form (with root the chosen vertex), by orienting all edges in the direction of paths going to the root. The category of rooted trees has very nice categorical properties not shared by the category of unrooted trees; see the following section. 


### As ordered sets

In [[order theory]], a tree is described by a [[partial order]] with the added property that it is downward [[well ordering|well ordered]]. Let $S$ be a [[partially ordered set]], then $S$ is a tree when for each $x \in S$ the downward closure or history $x^- = \{ y \mid y \leq x \}$ is a [[well ordered]] subset of $S$. If instead of a well-order we find that $x^-$ is only totally ordered (meaning that points in the tree do not have a distinguished successor) we say that $S$ is [[prefix ordered]].

### As functors 

Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the [[totally ordered set]] of natural numbers $0 \leq 1 \leq 2 \leq \ldots$, viewed as a [[category]]. A **rooted forest** is a [[presheaf]] on $\mathbb{N}$, i.e., a functor 
$$F: \mathbb{N}^{op} \to Set$$ 
to "the" [[category of sets]]. A **rooted tree** is a forest for which $F(0)$ is terminal (a [[point]]). 

In this case, we get from a tree as functor $F$ to a tree as digraph by passing to the [[category of elements]] $El(F)$. The vertices of the digraph are the elements, and the edges are those morphisms of $El(F)$ which map to morphisms $i + 1 \to i$ in $\mathbb{N}^{op}$. Notice that $\mathbb{N}^{op}$ is itself (the free category on) a tree as digraph, one that is terminal in the category of forests. 

In the other direction, starting with a tree as digraph, we define a functor $F \colon \mathbb{N}^{op} \to Set$ by letting $F(n)$ be the set of vertices $v$ such that the path from $v$ to the root has $n$ edges. The map $F(n+1) \to F(n)$ moves a vertex $v \in F(n+1)$ to the vertex that is one step closer to the root (along the unique path from $v$ to the root). 

The functor description makes it clear that the category of forests is a (presheaf) [[topos]], indeed a [[Grothendieck topos]]; therefore the [[category of trees]], which is equivalent, is also a [[topos]]. 

If we replace $Set$ here by the category of [[totally ordered set]]s $Tos$, then we may define a **planar forest** as a functor 

$$F: \mathbb{N}^{op} \to Tos$$ 

### As terminal coalgebra 

The category of trees as described in the section immediately above can be described universally in 2-universal terms, as the 2-terminal coalgebra for the endofunctor on $Cat$ (locally small categories) which takes a category to its small-coproduct cocompletion. See [[terminal coalgebra]] for an extended discussion. 

### As operations

Let $\mathbf{F}$ denote the free (strict) monoidal category generated by $n$-ary operations $\theta_n: x^n \to x$, one for each arity $n \geq 0$. A (finite) **planar forest with ($n$) live leaves** is a morphism $\phi: x^n \to x^m$ in $\mathbf{F}$; a (finite) **planar tree with ($n$) live leaves** is a morphism $\phi: x^n \to x$. 

The previous description is more a theorem than definition, but it points to the recursive construction of trees based on the fundamental equivalence between forests and trees: 

* The identity $x \to x$ corresponds to a root considered as a live leaf; 

* Given trees with live leaves $f_j \colon x^{n_j} \to x$, where $j \in \{1 \ldots, k\}$, there is a forest 
$$f_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes f_k \colon x^{n_1 + \ldots + n_k} = x^{n_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes x^{n_k} \to x \otimes \ldots \otimes x = x^k$$
whose set of live leaves is the disjoint union of sets of live leaves of the $f_j$. 

* Given a forest with live leaves 
$$f_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes f_k \colon x^{n_1 + \ldots + n_k} = x^{n_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes x^{n_k} \to x \otimes \ldots \otimes x = x^k$$ 
there is a tree 
$$\theta_n \circ (f_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes f_k) \colon x^{n_1 + \ldots + n_k} \to x$$ 
with the same set of live leaves. 

In more straightforward combinatorial language: if a finite planar tree is a functor $F \colon [n]^{op} \to \Delta_a$ from a finite ordinal to the augmented [[simplex category]], and a **leaf** is an element without predecessors in the poset of elements of $F$, then we can consider as extra structure some subset of the leaves whose elements are designated as **live**. The principle is that one is permitted to graft roots of trees onto live leaves, but not onto dead ones. (Dead leaves arise by plugging in the constant = $0$-ary operation $\theta_0 \colon I = x^0 \to x$.) 

Fancier versions of this basic recursive construction may involve "colored trees", "cherry trees", and so on, and figure prominently in the theory of [[operads]], especially in the construction of [[free operads]]. 

In fact, this type of recursivity is at the root (pun perhaps intended) of the [[cumulative hierarchy]] conception of sets in a material set theory like [[ZFC|ZFC set theory]]: all sets are collections of sets $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$, and all sets are formed in this way. In order to found this conception on trees in a way that accepts the [[axiom of foundation]], one must restrict to _well-founded_ trees. A tree (pictured as a free category on a digraph, i.e., as a certain poset $P$) is **well-founded** if every object of $P^{op}$ is bounded above by a maximal element, or equivalently if there are no infinite chains $x_0 \lt x_1 \lt \ldots$ in $P^{op}$ starting from the root $x_0$. (Chains starting from the root are also called **branches**.)  See [[well-founded relation]] for other formulations of this definition (including those suitable for [[constructive mathematics]]; see [[pure set]] for details on this construction of the cumulative hierarchy, including using arbitrary trees for _ill-founded_ sets. 

The category of well-founded trees admits a (2-)universal description, as an [[initial algebra]] for a certain endofunctor on [[Cat]]. See [[well-founded forest]] for details. 

[To be continued...]

+-- {: .query}
Very nice! Is there a similar story worth telling for possibly infinite trees, corecursion, etc. 

_Toby_:  Well-founded trees (and pure sets) may be defined recursively; ill-founded trees (and pure sets) may be defined corecursively; there is stuff about this at [[pure set]].  (Note that even a well-founded tree may be infinite, as long as some vertex has infinitely many branches out of it.)

### As relational structures

A _rooted tree_ can be defined as a [[relational structure]] and as such serves as a useful [[geometric models for modal logics|model]] in the context of [[modal logics]].  In this form it consists of a set of _nodes_, _vertices_ or whatever your preferred terminology is, and a binary relation, $S$, on $T$.  These are to satisfy the following:

* the set $T$ contains a unique element $r$ called the **root**, such that, for all $t\in T$, $S^*r t$ holds, where $S^*$ is the reflexive-[[transitive closure]] of $S$;

* if $t\in T$, and $t\neq r$, then there is a unique $t'\in T$ such that $S t' t$;

* $S$ is **acyclic**, so for all $t\in T$, $\neg S^+ t t$, where $S^+$ is the [[transitive closure]] of $S$.

This last property, of course, implies that $S$ is irreflexive.

### As polynomial endofunctors (after Kock) 

A new way of thinking about (rooted, usually assumed finite) trees has been introduced by [Joachim Kock](#Kock). 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
A *tree* $T$ consists of a set $T_0$ of edges, a set $T_1$ of nodes, and a set $T_2$ of *input flags*, all assumed finite, together with functions 

$$T_0 \stackrel{s}{\leftarrow} T_2 \stackrel{p}{\to} T_1 \stackrel{t}{\to} T_0$$ 

such that

* $t$ is injective,
* $s$ is injective and its image is complementary to a singleton $\{r\}$ (called the _root_), and
* for all $e \in T_0$ there exists a natural number $k$ such that $\sigma^k(e) = r$, where $\sigma : T_0 \to T_0$ is the "walk-to-root" function defined by $e \mapsto t(p(s^{-1}(e)))$ if $e \neq r$, else $r \mapsto r$.
=-- 

Some commentary is in order. The subscript $0$ for edges and $1$ for nodes is consonant with standard usage in [[string diagrams]], where edges are labeled by $0$-cells in a monoidal category and nodes by $1$-cells. Each node is pictured as having a multiplicity of (and possibly zero) input edges and exactly one outgoing edge; the map $t: T_1 \to T_0$ maps a node to its outgoing edge. Only the root edge is not an input edge of any node, i.e., the unique inhabitant of the complement of $im(s)$ is what we call the root $r$. Now: the input "function" $T_1 \to T_0$ is actually a multivalued function, taking a node to the set of its input edges, and is therefore represented as a [[relation]] or [[span]] from $T_0$ to $T_1$. The domain of this relation $T_2$ is the set of ordered pairs $(e, v)$ where $e \in T_0$ is an input edge of $v \in T_1$; this may be called a "flag" (thinking of a general flag as a chain of incidence relations, here a 1-step chain with $e$ input-incident to $v$). 

To each tree $T$ described in this form, there is an associated [[polynomial endofunctor]] $p_T: Set/T_0 \to Set/T_0$ controlled by the data 

$$T_0 \stackrel{s}{\leftarrow} T_2 \stackrel{p}{\to} T_1 \stackrel{t}{\to} T_0$$ 

and defined by the composition 

$$Set/T_0 \stackrel{s^\ast}{\to} Set/T_2 \stackrel{\Pi_p}{\to} Set/T_1 \stackrel{\Sigma_t}{\to} Set/T_0$$ 

where as usual $\Sigma_f \dashv f^\ast \dashv \Pi_f$. Notice that the functors on display preserve pullbacks, so $p_T$ preserves pullbacks. 

There is a [[double category]] whose $0$-cells are sets $I$, whose horizontal $1$-cells are polynomial endofunctors $p: Set/I \to Set/J$, whose vertical $1$-cells are pullback functors $f^\ast: Set/I \to Set/I'$ induced by functions $f: I' \to I$, and whose $2$-cells are [[cartesian natural transformations]] of the form 

$$\array{
Set/I & \stackrel{p}{\to} & Set/J \\ 
\mathllap{f^\ast} \downarrow & \swArrow & \downarrow \mathrlap{g^\ast} \\ 
Set/I' & \underset{p'}{\to} & Set/J'
}$$ 

The category consisting of horizontal arrows and 2-cells between them is called the *category of polynomial endofunctors*, $PolyEnd$. Kock defines a category of trees where objects are trees $T$ and whose morphisms are morphisms between the corresponding endofunctors $p_T$ as objects in $PolyEnd$. 

As Kock shows, this description of trees is well-adapted to the usual sorts of combinatorics that emerge in the study of [[operads]], such as free operads.

## Idea

In the [[category]] [[Set]] a 'pullback' is a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] of two [[sets]].  Given a [[diagram]] of [[sets]] and [[functions]] like this:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    A \ar[rd, "f"'] &   & B \ar[ld, "g"] \\
                    & C
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

the 'pullback' of this diagram is the [[subset]] $X \subseteq A \times B$ consisting of pairs $(a,b)$ such that the [[equation]] $f(a) = g(b)$ holds.  

A pullback is therefore the [[categorical semantics]] of an _[[equation]]_.

This construction comes up, for example, when $A$ and $B$ are [[fiber bundles]] over $C$: then $X$ as defined above is the [[product]] of $A$ and $B$ in the category of fiber bundles over $C$.  For this reason, a pullback is sometimes called a __fibered product__ (or _fiber product_ or _fibre product_).

In this case, the fiber of $A \times_C B$ over a [[generalized element|(generalized)]] element $x$ of $C$ is the ordinary [[product]] of the fibers of $A$ and $B$ over $x$.  In other words, the fiber product is the product taken fiber-wise.  Of course, the fiber of $A$ at the generalized element $x\colon I \to C$ is itself a fibre product $I \times_C A$; the terminology depends on your point of view.

Note that there are maps $p_A\colon X \to A$, $p_B\colon X \to B$ sending any $(a,b) \in X$ to $a$ and $b$, respectively.  These maps make this [[commuting diagram|square commute]]:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
                    & X \ar[ld, "p_A"'] \ar[rd, "p_B"] \\
    A \ar[rd, "f"'] &   & B \ar[ld, "g"]               \\
                    & C
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

In fact, the pullback is the [[universal property|universal]] solution to finding a commutative square like this.  In other words, given _any_ [[commutative diagram|commutative square]] 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
                    & Y \ar[ld, "q_A"'] \ar[rd, "q_B"] \\
    A \ar[rd, "f"'] &   & B \ar[ld, "g"]               \\
                    & C
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

there is a unique function $h\colon Y \to X$ such that 

$$ p_A h = q_A $$

and

$$ p_B h = q_B\,.$$

Since this universal property expresses the concept of pullback purely arrow-theoretically, we can formulate it in any category.  It is, in fact, a simple special case of a [[limit]].


## Definition

### In category theory

####As a limit

A **pullback** is a [[limit]] of a [[diagram]] like this:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    a \ar[rd, "f"'] &   & b \ar[ld, "g"] \\
                    & c
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Such a diagram is also called a **pullback diagram** or a [[cospan]].  If the [[limit]] exists, we obtain a commutative square

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
                    & x \ar[ld, "p_a"'] \ar[rd, "p_b"] \\
    a \ar[rd, "f"'] &   & b \ar[ld, "g"]               \\
                    & c
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

and [[generalized the|the]] object $x$ is also called the **pullback**. It is well defined up to unique [[isomorphism]]. It has the universal property already described above in the special case of the category $Set$.

The last commutative square above is called a __pullback square__.

The concept of pullback is dual to the concept of [[pushout]]: that is, a pullback in $C$ is the same as a pushout in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.

####Nuts and bolts

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, with $f\colon a\to c$ and $g\colon b\to c$ coterminal arrows in $\mathcal{C}$ as below

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    a \ar[rd, "f"'] &   & b \ar[ld, "g"] \\
                    & c
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

A **pullback** of $f$ and $g$ consists of an object $x$ together with arrows $p_a\colon x\to a$ and $p_b\colon x\to b$ such that the following diagram commutes universally

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
                    & x \ar[ld, "p_a"'] \ar[rd, "p_b"] \\
    a \ar[rd, "f"'] &   & b \ar[ld, "g"]               \\
                    & c
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

This means that for any other object $x'$ with arrows $p'_a\colon x'\to a$ and $p'_b\colon x'\to b$ such that 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
                    & x' \ar[ld, "p'_a"'] \ar[rd, "p'_b"] \\
    a \ar[rd, "f"'] &   & b \ar[ld, "g"]               \\
                    & c
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

commutes, there exists a unique arrow $u\colon x'\to x$ such that

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
                    & x' \ar[ld, "p'_a"'] \ar[rd, "p'_b"] \ar[d, "u", dotted] \\
    a & x \ar[l, "p_a"'] \ar[r, "p_b"]  & b               \\
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

commutes.

### In type theory

In [[type theory]] a [[pullback]] $P$ in

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    P \ar[r] \ar[d] & A \ar[d, "f"] \\
    B \ar[r, "g"']  & C
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

is given by the [[dependent sum]] over the [[dependent type|dependent]] [[equality type]]

$$
  P = \sum_{a\colon A} \sum_{b\colon B} (f(a) = g(b))
  \,.
$$



## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop #PullbacksAsEqualizers}
###### Proposition
**(pullbacks as equalizers)

If [[product]]s exist in $C$, then the pullback

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    a \times_c b \ar[r] \ar[d] & a \ar[d, "f"] \\
    b \ar[r, "g"']             & c
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

is equivalently the [[equalizer]]

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    a \times_c b \ar[r] & a \times b \ar[r, shift left, "fp_1"] \ar[r, shift right, "gp_2"'] & c
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

of the two morphisms induced by $f$ and $g$ out of the [[product]] of $a$ with $b$.

=--

As a consequence of the above, any category with binary products and equalizers has pullbacks.  Conversely any category with binary products and pullbacks has equalizers: the equalizer of $f,g:A \to B$ is the pullback of $(1,f) \maps A \to A \times B$ and $(1,g) \maps A \to A \times B$.

+-- {: .num_prop #PullbackPreservesMonomorphisms}
###### Proposition
**(pullbacks preserve monomorphisms and isomorphisms)

Pullbacks preserve [[monomorphisms]] and [[isomorphisms]]:

If 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    a \ar[r] \ar[d, "f^\ast g"'] & b \ar[d, "g"] \\
    c \ar[r, "f"']               & d
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

is a pullback square in some category then:

1. if $g$ is a [[monomorphism]] then $f^\ast g$ is a monomorphism;

1. if $g$ is an [[isomorphism]] then $f^\ast g$ is an isomorphism.

On the other hand that $f^\ast g$ is a monomorphism does not imply that $g$ is a monomorphism.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
**([[pasting law for pullbacks]])**

In any category consider a diagram of the form

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    a \ar[r] \ar[d] & b \ar[r] \ar[d] & c \ar[d] \\
    d \ar[r]        & e \ar[r]        & f
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

There are three commuting squares: the two inner ones and the outer one.

Suppose the right-hand inner square is a pullback, then: 

The square on the left is a pullback if and only if the outer square is.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Pasting a morphism $x \to a$ with the outer square gives rise to a commuting square over the (composite) bottom and right edges of the diagram.  The square over the cospan in the left-hand inner square arising from $x \to a$ includes a morphism into $b$, which if $b$ is a pullback induces the same commuting square over $d \to e \to f$ and $c \to d$.  So one square is universal iff the other is.
=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The converse implication does not hold: it may happen that the outer and the left square are pullbacks, but not the right square. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For instance let $i\colon a \to b$ be a [[split monomorphism]] with [[retract]] $p\colon b \to a$ and consider

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    a \ar[r, "="] \ar[d, "="'] & a \ar[r, "="] \ar[d, "i"] & a \ar[d, "="] \\
    a \ar[r, "i"']             & b \ar[r, "p"']            & a
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Then the left square and  the outer rectangle are pullbacks but the right square cannot be a pullback unless $i$ was already an [[isomorphism]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

On the other hand, in the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groupoids]], there is a sort of "partial converse"; see [[homotopy pullback#HomotopyFiberCharacterization]].

=--

### Saturation

The [[saturated class of limits|saturation]] of the class of pullbacks is the class of limits over categories $C$ whose groupoid reflection $\Pi_1(C)$ is trivial and such that $C$ is [[L-finite category|L-finite]].

### Pullback functor
{#PullbackFunctor}

If $f\colon X \to Y$ is a [[morphism]] in a [[category]] $C$ with pullbacks, there is an induced pullback [[functor]] $f^*\colon C/Y \to C/X$, sometimes also called [[base change]].

## Idea

In general, let $U = (U_i)_{i: I}$ and $V = (V_j)_{j: J}$ be two families of [[objects]] of some [[category]] $C$.  We say that $V$ is a __refinement__ of $U$ if there is a [[function]] $f: J \to I$ of indices and a [[morphism]] $V_j \to U_{f(j)}$ for each $j \in J$.

A common special case is the concept of refinement of [[open covers]], example \ref{RefinementOfOpenCovers} below.

## Examples ##


We state a list of examples, beginning with general cases and then consecutively making them more specific. 

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example


Very often we do this in the [[slice category]] $C/X$ for some object $X$.  If you spell this out, then you have families $(U_i \to X)_i$ and $(V_j \to X)_j$ of morphisms to $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if there are a function $f: J \to I$ and a commutative diagram
\[ \label{slice}
  \array{ 
    V_j &&\to&& U_{f(j)}
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
\]
for each $j$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

More specifically, apply this to the poset of [[subobjects]] of $X$.  Then you have families $(U_i \hookrightarrow X)_i$ and $(V_j \hookrightarrow X)_j$ of subobjects of $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if there are a function $f: J \to I$ and a commutative diagram (eq:slice) for each $j$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #RefinementOfSystemsOfSubsets}
###### Example

Yet more specifically, apply this to the lattice of [[subsets]] of some set $X$.  Then you have families $(U_i \subseteq X)_i$ and $(V_j \subseteq X)_j$ of subsets of $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if there is a function $f: J \to I$ such that each $V_j$ is contained in $U_{f(j)}$.

Yet more specifically, let the families of subsets be indexed by themselves.  Then have collections $U \subseteq \mathcal{P}X$ and $V \subseteq \mathcal{P}X$ of subsets of $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if for each $j$ there is an $i$ such that $V_j$ is contained in $U_i$.

=--

+-- {: .query}
Actually, this definition is slightly weaker than the previous one in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]].  Perhaps in that case the general definition should say that for each $j$ there is an $i$ and a morphism $V_j \to U_i$.
=--


+-- {: .num_example #RefinementOfOpenCovers}
###### Example
**(refinement of [[open covers]])

Special cases of example \ref{RefinementOfSystemsOfSubsets} include refinement of [[filters]] and refinement of [[open covers]] of [[topological spaces]].


Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[open subsets]] which [[cover|covers]] $X$ in that $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i \;= \;X$.

Then a _refinement_ of this open cover is a set of open subsets $\{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ which is still an [[open cover]] in itself and such that for each $j \in J$ there exists an $i \in I$ with $V_j \subset U_i$.

=--

On the other hand, you might want to generalise the case of open covers to [[covers]] or covering [[sieves]] on a [[site]].  In that case, the general definition still applies; you have covering families $(U_i \to X)_i$ and $(V_j \to X)_j$ of some object $X$; $V$ is a refinement of $U$ if there are a map $f: J \to I$ and a commutative diagram (eq:slice) for each $j$.

# Quotient sets
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Definitions

Given a [[set]] $S$ and an [[equivalence relation]] $\equiv$ on $S$, the __quotient set__ of $S$ by $\equiv$ is the set $S/{\equiv}$ whose elements are the elements of $S$ but where two elements are now considered [[equality|equal]] if in $S$ they were merely equivalent.

If changing the definition of equality like this is not allowed in your [[foundations]] of mathematics, then you can still define $S/{\equiv}$ as a [[subset]] of the [[power set]] of $S$ as follows:
\[\label{setdef}
A \in S/{\equiv} \;\Leftrightarrow\; \exists (x: S),\; A = \{y: S \;\mid\; x \equiv y\}\]
If you don\'t have (extensional) power sets either, then you\'ll have to use [[setoids]] (in which case, perhaps you\'d do better to change your terminology as described there).  Alternatively, don\'t worry about any of this and just include the existence of [[quotient objects]] in [[Set]] as an axiom (the __axiom of quotient sets__, which you have if you assume that $\Set$ is a [[pretopos]] or a [[Grothendieck topos]] as given by [[Giraud's axioms]]). There are actually two possible axiom of quotient sets, depending on what definition of relation one uses. 

* The weaker version of the axiom of quotient sets is the one which states that the [[coherent category]] $Set$ is a [[pretopos]]: that every [[internal equivalence relation]] on a set $A$, defined as a subset $\equiv$ of the Cartesian product $A \times A$ satisfying reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry, has a quotient set $A/\equiv$. 

* The stronger version of the axiom of quotient sets states that every [[proposition]] $x \equiv y$ in the [[context]] of the [[variables]] $x \in A$ and $y \in A$ which satisfies reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry has a quotient set $A/\equiv$. In some presentations of [[set theory]], this is an [[axiom schema]] of quotient sets.  

In any case, the element of $S/{\equiv}$ that comes from the element $x$ of $S$ may be denoted $[x]_{\equiv}$, or simply $[x]$ if ${\equiv}$ is understood, or simply $x$ if there will be no confusion as to which set it is an element of.  This $[x]$ is called the __[[equivalence class]]__ of $x$ with respect to $\equiv$; the term 'class' here is an old word for 'set' (in the sense of 'subset') and refers to the definition (eq:setdef) above, where $[x]$ is literally the set $A$.

### As initial objects in a category

Let $S$ be a [[set]] and let $\equiv$ be an [[equivalence relation]] on $S$. Let us define a *quotient set algebra of $S$ and $\equiv$* to be a set $A$ with a function $\iota S \to A$ such that for all $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, $(a \equiv b)$ implies $(\iota(a) = \iota(b))$. 

A *quotient set algebra homomorphism of $S$ and $\equiv$* is a function $f: A \to B$ between two quotient set algebras $A$ and $B$ such that for all $a \in S$, $f(\iota_A(a)) = \iota_B(a)$.

The *category of quotient set algebras of $S$ and $\equiv$* is the category $QSA(S, \equiv)$ whose objects $Ob(QSA(S, \equiv))$ are quotient set algebras of $S$ and $\equiv$ and whose morphisms $Mor(A, B)$ for $A \in Ob(QSA(S, \equiv))$ and $B \in Ob(QSA(S, \equiv))$ are quotient set algebra homomorphisms of $S$ and $\equiv$. The **quotient set** of $S$ and $\equiv$, denoted $S/\equiv$, is defined as the initial object in the category of quotient set algebras of $S$ and $\equiv$. 

### In type theory

Let $(T,\equiv)$ be a [[symmetric proset]]. The __quotient set__ $T/\equiv$ is a [[higher inductive type]] inductively generated by the following:

* a function $\iota: T \to T/\equiv$

* a family of dependent terms


  $$
    a \colon T
    ,\; 
    b \colon T 
    \;\;\; \vdash \;\;\; 
    eq_{T/\equiv}(a, b)
    \,\colon\, 
    (a \equiv b) 
    \;\to\; 
    (\iota(a) =_{T/\equiv} \iota(b))
  $$

* a family of dependent terms 
$$a:T/\equiv, b:T/\equiv \vdash \tau(a, b): isProp(a =_{T/\equiv} b)$$

The axiom of quotient sets in [[type theory]] says that every [[symmetric proset]] is a [[set]]. 

## Generalisations

Quotient sets in [[Set]] generalise to [[quotient object]]s in other categories. In particular, an [[exact category]] is a [[regular category]] in which every [[congruence]] on every object has an effective quotient object.

## Idea

A _maximal subgroup_ of a given [[group]] $G$ is a [[subgroup]] which is not all of $G$ and not contained in any other [[subgroup]] of $G$.

Hence a maximal subgroup is a [[maximal element]] of the [[lattice of subgroups]] after removing the trivial subgroup $G \subset G$ itself. More concisely it is a [[atom|coatom]] of $G$'s subgroup lattice.

## Idea

The _tensor product_ of two vector spaces is a new vector space with the property that [[bilinear maps]] out of the [[Cartesian product]] of the two spaces are equivalently [[linear maps]] out of the tensor product.

The tensor product of vector spaces is just the special case of the [[tensor product of modules]] over some [[ring]] $R$ for the case that this ring happens to be a [[field]].

The tensor product of vector spaces makes the [[category]] [[Vect]] of all [[vector spaces]] into a [[monoidal category]], in fact a [[distributive monoidal category]].
 
## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #TensorProductOfVectorSpaces} 
###### Definition

Given two [[vector spaces]] over some [[field]] $k$,  $V_1, V_2 \in Vect_k$, their [[tensor product of vector spaces]] is the vector space denoted

$$
  V_1 \otimes_k V_2 \in Vect
$$

whose elements are [[equivalence classes]] of formal linear combinations of [[tuples]] $(v_1,v_2)$ with $v_i \in V_i$, for the [[equivalence relation]] given by

$$
  (k v_1 , v_2) \;\sim\; k( v_1 , v_2) \;\sim\; (v_1, k v_2)
$$

$$
  (v_1 + v'_1 , v_2) \; \sim \; (v_1,v_2) + (v'_1, v_2)
$$

$$
  (v_1 , v_2 + v'_2) \; \sim \; (v_1,v_2) + (v_1, v'_2)
$$

More abstractly this means that the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] is the vector space characterized by the fact that

1. it receives a [[bilinear map]]
   
   $$
     V_1 \times V_2 \longrightarrow V_1 \otimes V_2
   $$

   (out of the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets)

1. any other [[bilinear map]] of the form

   $$
     V_1 \times V_2 \longrightarrow V_3
   $$

   factors through the above bilinear map via a unique [[linear map]]

   $$
     \array{
        V_1 \times V_2 &\overset{bilinear}{\longrightarrow}& V_3
        \\
        \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists ! \, linear}}
         \\
         V_1 \otimes_k V_2
     }

## Definition

A topological [[subspace]] $A$ is a **neighborhood retract** of a [[topological space]] $X$ if there is a [[neighborhood]] $U\supset A$ in $X$ such that $A$ is a [[retract]] of $U$. 

A [[metrisable space|metrisable]] topological space $Y$ is an _[[absolute neighborhood retract]]_ if for _any_ [[embedding of topological spaces|embedding]] $Y\subset Z$ as a [[closed subspace]] in a [[metrisable topological space]] $Z$, $Y$ is a neighborhood retract of $Z$.

A pair $(X,A)$ where $A$ is a [[closed subspace]] of $X$ is an **NDR-pair** or a closed Borsuk pair if there is a function $u:X\to I=[0,1]$ and a [[homotopy]] $H:X\times I\to X$ such that $H(x,0)=x$, for all $x\in X$, $H(a,t)=a$ for all $a\in A$, $H(x,1)\in A$ for all $x\in X$ such that $u(x)\lt 1$ and $u^{-1}(0)\subset A$. (See _[[deformation retract]]_.)

## Properties

The canonical inclusion $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ corresponding to any NDR-pair $(X,A)$ is a [[Hurewicz cofibration]].

## Idea 

A Noetherian (or often, as below, noetherian) [[ring]] (or [[rng]]) is one where it is possible to do [[induction]] over its ideals, because the ordering of ideals by reverse inclusion is [[well-founded relation|well-founded]]. 

## Definition

### Noetherian rings

Every [[ring]] $R$ has a canonical $R$-$R$-[[bimodule]] structure, with [[left action]] $\alpha_L:R \times R \to R$ and [[right action]] $\alpha_R:R \times R \to R$ defined as the multiplicative binary operation on $R$ and [[biaction]] $\alpha:R \times R \times R \to R$ defined as the ternary product on $R$:
$$\alpha_L(a, b) \coloneqq a \cdot b$$
$$\alpha_R(a, b) \coloneqq a \cdot b$$
$$\alpha(a, b, c) \coloneqq a \cdot b \cdot c$$

Let $\mathrm{TwoSidedIdeals}(R)$ be the [[category of two-sided ideals]] in $R$, whose objects are [[two-sided ideals]] $I$ in $R$, [[subbimodules|sub-$R$-$R$-bimodules]] of $R$ with respect to the canonical bimodule structure on $R$, and whose [[morphisms]] are $R$-$R$-[[bimodule monomorphisms]]. 

An ascending chain of two-sided ideals in $R$ is a [[direct sequence]] of two-sided ideals in $R$, a [[sequence]] of two-sided ideals $A:\mathbb{N} \to \mathrm{TwoSidedIdeals}(R)$ with the following [[dependent sequence]] of $R$-$R$-bimodule monomorphisms: for natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a dependent $R$-$R$-bimodule monomorphism $i_n:A_{n} \hookrightarrow A_{n+1}$. 

A [[ring]] $R$ is **Noetherian** if it satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] on its two-sided ideals: for every ascending chain of two-sided ideals $(A, i_n)$ in $R$, there exists a natural number $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all natural numbers $n \geq m$, the $R$-$R$-bimodule monomorphism $i_n:A_{n} \hookrightarrow A_{n+1}$ is an $R$-$R$-[[bimodule isomorphism]]. 

### Left Noetherian rings

Let $\mathrm{LeftIdeals}(R)$ be the category of [[left ideals]] in $R$, whose objects are [[left ideals]] $I$ in $R$, sub-left-$R$-modules of $R$ with respect to the canonical [[left module]] structure $(-)\cdot(-):R \times R \to R$ on $R$, and whose [[morphisms]] are left $R$-module monomorphisms. 

An ascending chain of left ideals in $R$ is a [[direct sequence]] of left ideals in $R$, a [[sequence]] of left ideals $A:\mathbb{N} \to \mathrm{LeftIdeals}(R)$ with the following [[dependent sequence]] of left $R$-module monomorphisms: for natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a dependent left $R$-module monomorphism $i_n:A_{n} \hookrightarrow A_{n+1}$. 

A [[ring]] $R$ is **left Noetherian** if it satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] on its left ideals: for every ascending chain of left ideals $(A, i_n)$ in $R$, there exists a natural number $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all natural numbers $n \geq m$, the left $R$-module monomorphism $i_n:A_{n} \hookrightarrow A_{n+1}$ is an left $R$-module isomorphism. 

### Right Noetherian rings

Let $\mathrm{RightIdeals}(R)$ be the category of [[right ideals]] in $R$, whose objects are [[right ideals]] $I$ in $R$, sub-right-$R$-modules of $R$ with respect to the canonical [[right module]] structure $(-)\cdot(-):R \times R \to R$ on $R$, and whose [[morphisms]] are right $R$-module monomorphisms. 

An ascending chain of right ideals in $R$ is a [[direct sequence]] of right ideals in $R$, a [[sequence]] of right ideals $A:\mathbb{N} \to \mathrm{RightIdeals}(R)$ with the following [[dependent sequence]] of right $R$-module monomorphisms: for natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a dependent right $R$-module monomorphism $i_n:A_{n} \hookrightarrow A_{n+1}$. 

A [[ring]] $R$ is **right Noetherian** if it satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] on its right ideals: for every ascending chain of right ideals $(A, i_n)$ in $R$, there exists a natural number $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all natural numbers $n \geq m$, the right $R$-module monomorphism $i_n:A_{n} \hookrightarrow A_{n+1}$ is an right $R$-module isomorphism.

over R in a [[finite number]] $n$ of [[coordinates]] are Noetherian.

## Properties 

Spectra of noetherian rings are glued together to define [[noetherian scheme|locally noetherian schemes]]. 

### General

One of the best-known properties is the Hilbert basis theorem. Let $R$ be a (unital) ring. 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
**(Hilbert)** 
If $R$ is left Noetherian, then so is the [[polynomial|polynomial algebra]] $R[x]$. (Similarly if "right" is substituted for "left".) 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
(We adapt the proof from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_basis_theorem#First_Proof).) Suppose $I$ is a left ideal of $R[x]$ that is not finitely generated. Using the [[axiom of dependent choice]], there is a [[sequence]] of polynomials $f_n \in I$ such that the left ideals $I_n \coloneqq (f_0, \ldots, f_{n-1})$ form a strictly increasing chain and $f_n \in I \setminus I_n$ is chosen to have degree as small as possible. Putting $d_n \coloneqq \deg(f_n)$, we have $d_0 \leq d_1 \leq \ldots$. Let $a_n$ be the leading coefficient of $f_n$. The left ideal $(a_0, a_1, \ldots)$ of $R$ is finitely generated; say $(a_0, \ldots, a_{k-1})$ generates. Thus we may write 

$$\label{kill} a_k = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} r_i a_i$$ 

The polynomial $g = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} r_i x^{d_k - d_i} f_i$ belongs to $I_k$, so $f_k - g$ belongs to $I \setminus I_k$. Also $g$ has degree $d_k$ or less, and therefore so does $f_k - g$. But notice that the coefficient of $x^{d_k}$ in $f_k - g$ is zero, by (eq:kill). So in fact $f_k - g$ has degree less than $d_k$, contradicting how $f_k$ was chosen. 

=-- 

### A homological characterization

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
For a unital ring $R$ the following are equivalent:

1. $R$ is left Noetherian
1. Any small direct sum of injective left $R$-modules is injective.
1. $\operatorname{Ext}^k_R(A, \cdot)$ commutes with small direct sums for any finitely generated $A$.
=--

Direct sums here can be replaced by filtered colimits.

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
$1 \Rightarrow 2$: assume that $R$ is Noetherian and $I_\alpha$ are injective modules. In order to verify that $I := \bigoplus_\alpha I_\alpha$ is injective it is enough to show that for any ideal $\mathfrak{j}$ any morphism of left modules $f : \mathfrak{j} \to I$ factors through $\mathfrak{j} \to R$. Since $R$ is Notherian, $\mathfrak{j}$ is finitely generated, so the image of $f$ lies in a finite sum $I_{\alpha_1} \oplus \dots \oplus I_{\alpha_n}$. Thus an extension to $R$ exists by the injectivity of each $I_{\alpha_k}$.

$2 \Rightarrow 1$: if $R$ is not left Noetherian then there is a sequence of left ideals $\mathfrak{j}_1 \subsetneq \mathfrak{j}_2 \subsetneq \dots$. Take $\mathfrak{j} := \bigcup_k \mathfrak{j}_k$. The obvious map $j \to \prod_k (\mathfrak{j} / \mathfrak{j}_k)$ factors through $\bigoplus_k (\mathfrak{j} / \mathfrak{j}_k)$, since any element lies in all but finitely many $\mathfrak{j}_k$. Now take any injective $I_k$ with $0 \to \mathfrak{j} / \mathfrak{j}_k \to I_k$. The map $\mathfrak{j} \to \bigoplus_k I_k$ cannot extend to the whole $R$, since otherwise its image would be contained in a sum of finitely many $I_k$. Therefore, $\bigoplus_k I_k$ is not injective.

$2 \Rightarrow 3$: $\operatorname{Ext}^k_R(A, \bigoplus_\alpha X_\alpha)$ can be computed by taking an injective resolution of $\bigoplus_\alpha X_\alpha$. Since direct sums of injective modules are assumed to be injective, we can take a direct sum of injective resolutions of each $X_\alpha$. It remains to note that Hom out of a finitely generated module commutes with arbitrary direct sums.

$3 \Rightarrow 2$: Follows from the fact that $I$ is injective iff $\operatorname{Ext}^1_R(R / \mathfrak{i}, I) = 0$ for any ideal $\mathfrak{i}$.
=--

## Noetherian and Artinian rings

A dual condition is artinian: an __[[artinian ring]]__ is a ring satisfying the descending chain condition on ideals. The symmetry is severely broken if one considers unital rings: for example every unital artinian ring is noetherian; artinian rings are intuitively much smaller than generic noetherian rings.

### In point-set topology
 {#InPointSetTopology}

In [[point-set topology]], the (un-[[reduced suspension|reduced]]) *suspension* $\mathrm{S} X$ of an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[topological space]] $X$ is the [[quotient space]] of the [[cylinder]] space $X \times [-1,1]$ (the [[product space]] with a [[closed interval]]) by the relation which identifies all the points at either end:

\[
  \label{PointSetFormula}
  \mathrm{S}X
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \frac{
    X \,\times\, [-1,\, +1]
  }{
    \left(
    \begin{array}{c}  
      X \times \{-1\}\mathrlap{,\,}
      \\
      X \times \{+1\}
    \end{array}
    \right)
  }  \,.

In particular, the suspension of an [[n-sphere|$n$-sphere]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the $(n+1)$-sphere

$$
  S^{n+1} 
    \;\underset{\mathrm{homeo}}{\simeq}\; 
  \mathrm{S}(S^n)
  \,,
$$

namely the [[union]] of (in terms of the above graphics):

1. a north pole "$nth$"

1. a south pole "$sth$"

1. the [[meridians]] "$mer(x)$" through all points $x \in S^{n}$ on the [[equator]].

Hence, by [[induction]], the $(n+1)$-sphere is homeomorphic to the $n+1$-fold suspension of the [[0-sphere]]:

$$
  S^{n+1} 
    \;\underset{\mathrm{homeo}}{\simeq}\; 
  \mathrm{S}^{n+1}(S^0)
  \,.
$$


### In homotopy theory
 {#InHomotopyTheory}

Regarded in the [[classical homotopy category]], the suspension construction (eq:PointSetFormula) on a [[CW-complex]] $X$ is a canonical model for the *[[suspension object]]* of the [[homotopy type]] represented by $X$ --- namely the [[homotopy pushout]] of the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[map]] $X \to \ast$ along itself) --- and as such plays a key role in [[homotopy theory]] and [[stable homotopy theory]].

This also explains the usual definition of the suspension of the [[empty space]] as the [[0-sphere]]

$$
  \mathrm{S}(\varnothing)
  \;=\;
  S^0
  \,,
$$

since the latter does model the [[homotopy pushout]] of $\varnothing \to \ast$ along itself (which is just a [[1-category]][[category theory|theoretic]] [[pushout]] and hence the [[coproduct]] of the [[point space]] with itself).

For more on this see at *[[suspension object]]*.

More precisely, what appears in most of [[algebraic topology]] and [[stable homotopy theory]] is the *[[reduced suspension]]* of [[pointed topological spaces]] $(X,x_0)$ (and eventually their [[suspension spectra]]):

$$
  \Sigma X \,\coloneqq\, \mathrm{S}X / \{x_0\}
  \,,
$$ 

where in addition the copy of the interval over the given basepoint is identified with a single point. For [[CW-complexes]] the [[reduced suspension]] is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the ordinary suspension.

In this context of ([[stable homotopy theory|stable]]) [[homotopy theory]], the suspension construction is part of the canonical [[point-set topology|point-set]] model for [[cofiber sequences]] induced from any [[mapping cone]] construction:

## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[space]] (such as a [[topological space]], or something more interesting like a [[generalized smooth space]]).  Let $I$ be the unit [[interval]] $[0,1]$ in the [[real line]]; let $2$ be the $2$-point [[discrete space]] $\{\bot,\top\}$.  Let $X \times I \times 2$ be the [[cartesian product]] of $X$, $2$, and $I$; let $X + (X \times 2 \times I) + 2$ be the [[disjoint union]] of $X$, $X \times I \times 2$ and $2$.  We will suppress reference to the inclusion maps into $X + (X \times I) + 2$; it will be clear from context how to parse an element of the latter.


### Generalisable definition

The __suspension__ $S X$ of $X$ is the [[quotient space]] of $X + (X \times I \times 2) + 2$ by the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ generated by:

*  $a \sim (a,0,\bot)$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $a \sim (a,0,\top)$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1,\bot) \sim \bot$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1,\top) \sim \top$ for $a$ in $X$.


### Generalisation: the join

This generalises immediately to an operation called the _[[join of topological spaces|join]]_ $X \star Y$ of two spaces $X$ and $Y$; this is the quotient space of $X + (X \times I \times Y) + Y$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $a \sim (a,0,b)$ for $a$ in $X$ and $b$ in $Y$;
*  $(a,1,b) \sim b$ for $a$ in $X$ and $b$ in $Y$.

(Compare [[join of simplicial sets]] and [[join of topological spaces]], the same operation in another guise.)  Then we have $S X = X \star 2$.


### Simplified definition

It is somewhat simpler to define $S X$ as the quotient space of $(X \times I) + 2$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $(a,0) \sim \bot$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1) \sim \top$ for $a$ in $X$.

This works to define a topological space, but it does not directly give the smooth structure that matches the picture above.


### Further simplified for pointed spaces

If $X$ has a point $p$, hence if it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], then we can define $S X$ as the quotient space of $X \times I$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $(a,0) \sim (b,0)$ for $a, b$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1) \sim (b,1)$ for $a, b$ in $X$.

This is probably the most common definition seen, but it only works for $X$ an inhabited space (and even then gives only the topological structure).

### Reduced suspension

To make the suspension of a [[pointed space]] $(X,p)$ again a [[pointed space]] one may further collapse in $S X$ the set $\{p\} \times I$ to the point. The result then is called the _[[reduced suspension]]_ of $(X,p)$ and is denoted 

$$
  \Sigma X \coloneqq
  S X / \{p \} \times I
  \simeq
  X \times I / \left(
    X \times \{0,1\}
    \cup
    \{p\} \times I
  \right)
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### As a functor

It\'s easy to extend the suspension operation $S$ to a [[functor]] from [[Top]] to itself.

### Relation between suspension and reduced suspension

For [[CW-complexes]] suspension and [[reduced suspension]] agree, up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

### Cogroup structure

In the pointed case ([[reduced suspension]]): [[suspensions are H-cogroup objects]]

## Examples

### Suspension of cubes

The suspension of the $n$-[[cube]] is the $(n+1)$-cube, probably best visualised as a diamond.  This gives a [[recursion|recursive]] definition of cube, starting with the $0$-cube as the [[point]], which is not the suspension of anything.  Note that this not only gives us the [[topological structure]] of the cube, but also (by working in an appropriate [[category]] of [[smooth spaces]] throughout) the correct [[smooth structure]] on the cube as a [[manifold with corners]].  You can probably even get the correct [[metric space|metric]] on the cube (normalised to have diagonals of length $1$) automatically by using a more complicated quotienting process.

### Suspension of spheres

Up to [[homeomorphism]], the suspension of the $n$-[[sphere]] is the $(n+1)$-sphere, and the [[reduced suspension]] is 

$$
  \Sigma S^n \simeq S^{n+1}
  \,.
$$

See at _[one-point compactification -- Examples -- Spheres](one-point+compactification#ExamplesSpheres)_ for details.

Notice that the $n$-sphere is (topologically) the [[boundary]] of the $(n+1)$-cube.  The coincidence that 'sphere' and 'suspension' both begin with 's' has not been ignored; we can write $S^n \cong S^n(2)$, where $S^n$ on the left is the $n$-sphere and $S^n$ on the right is the $n$-fold [[composite]] of the suspension functor.  (Actually, you should start with the $(-1)$-sphere as the [[empty space]], which is not the suspension of anything; then the $0$-sphere is $S \empty = 2$.)  However, this does not give the correct smooth structure on the sphere, unless perhaps there is some more sophisticated definition that fixes this (but then that would break the cube).  It might be more appropriate to say that the suspension of the $n$-[[globe]] is the $(n+1)$-globe.

### Suspension of simplices

Up to topological structure, the suspension of the $n$-[[simplex]] is the $(n+1)$-simplex, but now this is not very useful.  To study simplices, you should use the __cone__ functor instead, which is $\Lambda X = X \star 1$, where $1$ is the [[point]].

## Definition

In a [[monoid]], an element $x$ is __irreducible__ if it is neither [[invertible element|invertible]] nor the product of two non-invertible elements.  Without [[bias]], we can say that $x$ is irreducible if, whenever it is written as a product of a [[finite list]] of elements, at least one element in the list is invertible.

In a [[commutative ring]], an element is **irreducible** if it is neither [[invertible element|invertible]] nor the product of two non-invertible elements, with respect to the multiplication operation on the commutative ring. 

## Examples

* Every [[prime number]] is an irreducible element in the integers. 

* Given a field $K$, every [[monic polynomial]] of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] one is an irreducible element in the univariate [[polynomial ring]] $K[x]$.

##Idea

Cellular homology is a very efficient tool for computing the [[ordinary homology|ordinary]] [[homology groups]] of [[topological spaces]] which are [[CW complexes]], based on the [[relative singular homology]] of their [[cell complex]]-decomposition and using [[degree of a continuous function|degree]]-computations.

Hence cellular homology uses the combinatorial structure of a CW-complex to define, first a [[chain complex]] of _celluar chains_ and then the corresponding [[chain homology]]. The resulting _cellular homology_ of a CW-complex is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to its [[singular homology]], hence to its [[ordinary homology]] as a topological space, and hence provides an efficient method for computing the latter.

## Definition 

### CW-Complex

For definiteness and to fix notation which we need in the following, we recall the definition of _[[CW-complex]]_. The actual definition of cellular homology is [below](#CellularHomology).

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $S^n \in $ [[Top]] for the standard $n$-[[sphere]];

* $D^n \in $ [[Top]] for the standard $n$-[[disk]];

* $S^n \hookrightarrow D^{n+1}$ for the [[continuous function]] that includes the $n$-sphere as the [[boundary]] of the $(n+1)$-disk.

Write furthermore $S^{-1} \coloneqq \emptyset$ for the [[empty set|empty]] topological space and think of $S^{-1} \to D^0 \simeq *$ as the boundary inclusion of the (-1)-sphere into the 0-disk, which is the [[point]].

+-- {: .num_defn #CWComplex} 
###### Definition

A **[[CW complex]] of [[dimension]] $(-1)$** is the [[empty set|empty]] [[topological space]].

By [[induction]], for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a **[[CW complex]] of [[dimension]] $n$** is a [[topological space]] $X_{n}$ obtained from

1. a $CW$-complex $X_{n-1}$ of dimension $n-1$;

1. an index set $Cell(X)_n \in Set$;

1. a set of [[continuous maps]] (the **attaching maps**) $\{ f_i \colon S^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}\}_{i \in Cell(X)_n}$

as the [[pushout]] $X_n \simeq \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_n} D^n \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_n S^{n-1}} X_n$

$$
  \array{
    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_{n}} S^{n-1} &\stackrel{(f_j)}{\to}& X_{n-1}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_{n}} D^{n} &\to& X_{n} 
  }
  \,.
$$ 

By this construction an $n$-dimensional CW-complex is canonical a [[filtered topological space]] with filter inclusion maps

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n
$$

the right vertical morphisms in these pushout diagrams. 

A general **[[CW complex]]** $X$ is a [[topological space]] given as the [[sequential colimit]] over a [[tower]] [[diagram]] each of whose morphisms is such a filter inclusion 

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

=--

For the following a CW-complex is all this data: the chosen [[filtered topological space|filtering]] with the chosen attaching maps. 


### Cellular homology
 {#CellularHomology}

We define "[[ordinary homology|ordinary]]" cellular homology with [[coefficients]] in the [[group]] $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]]. The analogous definition for other [[coefficients]] is immediate.


+-- {: .num_defn #CellularChainComplex} 
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[CW-complex]], def. \ref{CWComplex}, its
**cellular chain complex** $H_\bullet^{CW}(X) \in Ch_\bullet$ is the [[chain complex]] such that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$

* the [[abelian group]] of [[chains]] is the [[relative singular homology]] group of $X_n \hookrightarrow X$ relative to $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X$:

  $$
    H_n^{CW}(X) \coloneqq H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})
    \,,
  $$

* the [[differential]] $\partial^{CW}_{n+1} \colon H_{n+1}^{CW}(X) \to H_n^{CW}(X)$ is the [[composition]]

  $$
    \partial^{CW}_n 
    \colon
    H_{n+1}(X_{n+1}, X_n) 
     \stackrel{\partial_n}{\to} 
    H_n(X_n) 
     \stackrel{i_n}{\to} 
    H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})
    \,,
  $$ 

  where $\partial_n$ is the [[boundary]] map of the [[singular chain complex]] and where $i_n$ is the morphism on [[relative homology]] induced from the canonical inclusion of pairs $(X_n, \emptyset) \to (X_n, X_{n-1})$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 

The composition $\partial^{CW}_{n} \circ \partial^{CW}_{n+1}$ of two differentials in def. \ref{CellularChainComplex} is indeed zero, hence $H^{CW}_\bullet(X)$ is indeed a [[chain complex]].

=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

On representative singular [[chains]] the morphism $i_n$ acts as the identity and hence $\partial^{CW}_{n} \circ \partial^{CW}_{n+1}$ acts as the double singular boundary, $\partial_{n} \circ \partial_{n+1} = 0$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

By the discussion at _[Relative homology - Relation to reduced homology of quotient spaces](relative%20homology#RelationToQuotientTopologicalSpaces)_ the relative homology group $H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})$ is isomorphic to the the [[reduced homology]] $\tilde H_n(X_n/X_{n-1})$ of $X_n/X_{n-1}$.

This implies in particular that 

* a **cellular $n$-chain** is a singular $n$-chain required to sit in filtering degree $n$, hence in $X_n \hookrightarrow X$;

* a **cellular $n$-cycle** is a singular $n$-chain whose singular boundary is not necessarily 0, but is contained in filtering degree $(n-2)$, hence in $X_{n-2} \hookrightarrow X$.

### Cellular chains

###### Proposition 

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H^{CW}_n(X)

  H_n(X_n, X_{n-1}) 
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}(Cell(X)_n)
$$

that the group of cellular $n$-chains with the [[free abelian group]] whose set of [[basis]] elements is the set of $n$-[[disks]] attached to $X_{n-1}$ to yield $X_n$. 

=-- 

This is discussed at _[Relative homology - Homology of CW-complexes](relative%20homology#RelativeHomologyOfCWComplexes)_.


+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

Thus, each cellular differential $\partial^{CW}_n$ can be described as a [[matrix]] $M$ with [[integer]] entries $M_{i j}$. Here an index $j$ refers to the attaching map $f_j \colon S^n \to X_n$ for the $j^{th}$ disk $D^{n+1}$. The integer entry $M_{i j}$ corresponds to a map 

$$\mathbb{Z} \cong H_{n+1}(D^{n+1}, S^n) \to H_n(S^n) \to H_n(D^n, S^{n-1}) \cong H_n(S^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$$ 

and is computed as the [[degree of a continuous function]]

$$S^n \stackrel{f_j}{\to} X_n \to X_n/(X_n - D^n) \cong D^n/S^{n-1} \cong S^n$$ 

where the inclusion $X_n - D^n \hookrightarrow X_n$ corresponds to the attaching map for the $i^{th}$ disk $D^n$.

### Relation to singular homology

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 

For $X$ a [[CW-complex]], its cellular homology $H^{CW}_\bullet(X)$ agrees with its [[singular homology]] $H_\bullet(X)$:

$$
  H^{CW}_\bullet(X)
  \simeq
  H_\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$

### Relation to the spectral sequence of the filtered singular complex
 {#RelationToSpectralSequenceOfFilteredSingularComplex}

The structure of a [[CW-complex]] on a [[topological space]] $X$, def. \ref{CWComplex} naturally induces on its [[singular simplicial complex]] $C_\bullet(X)$ the structure of a [[filtered chain complex]]:


+-- {: .num_defn } 
###### Definition

For $X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X$ a [[CW complex]], and $p \in \mathbb{N}$, write

$$
  F_p C_\bullet(X) \coloneqq C_\bullet(X_p)
$$

for the [[singular chain complex]] of $X_p \hookrightarrow X$. The given  [[topological subspace]] inclusions $X_p \hookrightarrow X_{p+1}$ induce [[chain map]] inclusions $F_p C_\bullet(X) \hookrightarrow F_{p+1} C_\bullet(X)$ and these equip the singular chain complex $C_\bullet(X)$ of $X$ with the structure of a bounded [[filtered chain complex]]

$$
  0 
  \hookrightarrow
  F_0 C_\bullet(X)
  \hookrightarrow
  F_1 C_\bullet(X)
  \hookrightarrow
  F_2 C_\bullet(X)
  \hookrightarrow 
  \cdots
  \hookrightarrow 
  F_\infty C_\bullet(X)
  \coloneqq
  C_\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$

(If $X$ is of finite [[dimension]] $dim X$ then this is a bounded filtration.)

Write $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ for the [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] corresponding to this filtering.

=--

We identify various of the pages of this spectral sequences with structures in singular homology theory.

+-- {: .num_prop #PagesInTheSpectralSequenceOfTheFilteredSingularComplex} 
###### Proposition

* $r = 0$ -- $E^0_{p,q}(X) \simeq C_{p+q}(X_p)/C_{p+q}(X_{p-1})$ is the group of $X_{p-1}$-[[relative homology|relative (p+q)-chains]] in $X_p$;

* $r = 1$ -- $E^1_{p,q}(X) \simeq H_{p+q}(X_p, X_{p-1})$ is the $X_{p-1}$-[[relative singular homology]] of $X_p$;

* $r = 2$ -- $E^2_{p,q}(X) \simeq \left\{ \array{ H_p^{CW}(X) & for\; q = 0 \\ 0 & otherwise }  \right.$

* $r = \infty$ -- $E^\infty_{p,q}(X) \simeq F_p H_{p+q}(X) / F_{p-1} H_{p+q}(X) $.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

(...)

=--

This now directly implies the isomorphism between the cellular homology and the singular homology of a CW-complex $X$:

+-- {: .num_cor #CelluarEquivalentToSingularFromSpectralSequence} 
###### Corollary

$$ 
  H^{CW}_\bullet(X) \simeq H_\bullet(X)
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the third item of prop. \ref{PagesInTheSpectralSequenceOfTheFilteredSingularComplex} the $(r = 2)$-page of the spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ is concentrated in the $(q = 0)$-row. This implies that all [[differentials]] for $r \gt 2$ vanish, since their domain and codomain groups necessarily have different values of $q$. Accordingly we have 

$$
  E^\infty_{p,q}(X) \simeq E^2_{p,q}(X)
$$

for all $p,q$. By the third and fourth item of prop. \ref{PagesInTheSpectralSequenceOfTheFilteredSingularComplex} this is equivalently

$$
  G_p H_{p}(X) \simeq H^{CW}_p(X)
  \,.
$$

Finally observe that $G_p H_p(X) \simeq H_p(X)$ by the definition of the filtering on the homology as $F_p H_p(X) \coloneq image(H_p(X_p) \to H_p(X))$ and by standard properties of singular homology of [[CW complexes]] discusses at _[CW complex -- singular homology](CW+complex#SingularHomology)_.

## Idea

The notion of an _idempotent_ [[morphism]] in a [[category]] generalizes the notion of _[[projector]]_ in the context of [[linear algebra]]: it is an [[endomorphism]] $e \colon X \to X$ of some [[object]] $X$ that "squares to itself" in that the [[composition]] of $e$ with itself is again $e$:

$$
  e \circ e = e
  \,.
$$

Accordingly, given any idempotent $e \colon X \to X$ it is of interest to ask what [[subobject]] $A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} X$ of $X$ it is the projector onto, in that there is a [[projection]] $X \stackrel{p}{\to} A$ such that the idempotent is the composite of this projection followed by including $A$ back into $X$:

$$
  e \colon X \stackrel{p}{\to} A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} X
  \,.
$$

As opposed to the case of linear algebra, in general such a factorization into a projection onto a subobject $A$ need not actually exists for an idempotent $e$ in a generic category. If it exists, one says that $e$ is a _[[split idempotent]]_. 

Accordingly, one is interested in those categories for which every idempotent is split. These are called _[[idempotent complete categories]]_ or _[[Cauchy complete categories]]_. If a category is not yet idempotent complete it can be completed to one that is: its _[[Karoubi envelope]]_ or _[[Cauchy completion]]_.


## Definition

An [[endomorphism]] $e\colon B \to B$ in a [[category]] is an **idempotent** if the [[composition]] with itself equals itself 

$$
  e \circ  e = e
  \,.
$$

A **splitting** of an idempotent $e$ consists of morphisms $s\colon A \to B$ and $r\colon B \to A$ such that $r \circ s = 1_A$ and $s \circ r = e$.  In this case $A$ is a [[retract]] of $B$, and we call $e$ a [[split idempotent]].

Of course, we can simply consider the __idempotent elements__ of any [[monoid]].


## Properties

### The algebra of idempotents

Given an [[abelian monoid]] $R$, the idempotent elements form a [[submonoid]] $Idem(R)$.

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, the idempotent elements of $R$ form a [[Boolean algebra]] $Idem(R)$ with these operations:

*  $\top \coloneqq 1$,
*  $P \wedge Q \coloneqq P Q$,
*  $\bot \coloneqq 0$,
*  $P \vee Q \coloneqq P - P Q + Q$,
*  $\neg{P} \coloneqq 1 - P$.

This is important in [[measure theory]]; if $R$ is the ring $L^\infty(X,\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})$ of [[essentially bounded function|essentially bounded]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[measurable functions]] on some [[measurable space]] $(X,\mathcal{M})$ modulo an ideal $\mathcal{N}$ of [[null sets]], then $Idem(R)$ is the Boolean algebra of [[characteristic functions]] of [[measurable sets]] modulo null sets, which is [[isomorphic]] to the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{N}$ of measurable sets modulo null sets itself.

If $R$ is a commutative $*$-[[star-ring|ring]], then we may restrict to the [[self-adjoint element|self-adjoint]] idempotent elements to get the Boolean algebra $Proj(R)$.  In measure theory, if $R$ is the [[complex number|complex]]-valued version of $L^\infty(X,\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})$, then $Proj(R)$ will still reconstruct $\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{N}$.  In [[operator algebra]] theory, the self-adjoint idempotent elements of an operator algebra are called [[projection operator]]s, which is the origin of the notation $Proj$.  (Sometimes one requires projection operators to be _proper_: to have norm $1$; the only projection operator that is not proper is $0$.)

The projection operators of a commutative $W^\star$-[[W-star-algebra|algebra]] give the link between operator algebra theory and measure theory; in fact, the [[categories]] of commutative $W^\star$-algebras and of [[localisable measurable spaces]] (or [[measurable locales]]) are [[dual equivalence|dual]], and $W^\star$-algebra theory in general may be thought of as noncommutative measure theory.  In noncommutative measure theory, the projection operators are still important, but they no longer form a Boolean algebra.


### The universal idempotent-split completion

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ one may ask for the [[universal construction|universal]] category obtained from $\mathcal{C}$ subject to the constraint that all idempotents are turned into [[split idempotents]]. This is called the _[[Karoubi envelope]]_  of $\mathcal{C}$. More generally, in [[enriched category theory]] it is called the _[[Cauchy completion]]_ of $\mathcal{C}$.

## Definition

In the context of [[algebraic topology]], a [[continuous map]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ between two [[topological spaces]] $X,Y$, is said to be _null homotopic_ if it is [[homotopic]] to a [[constant map]] $g$. This is considered in particular in the context of [[pointed topological spaces]] with base point-preserving maps between them, hence for $g$ the map constant on the base point of $Y$ (which is the [[zero morphism]] in this context).

In the context of [[homological algebra]], a _null homotopy_ is a [[chain homotopy]] from (or to) the [[zero map]].

Generally in abstract [[homotopy theory]], a null homotopy in an [[pointed (infinity,1)-category]] is a [[2-morphism]] to (or from) a [[zero morphism]]. 

This general concept subsumes the previous two cases via the [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories presented by]] the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]] or a [[model structure on chain complexes]], respectively.

## Definition

A __skewfield__ (also spelled skew-field), or __reciprocal ring__ is a [[unitality|unital]] [[ring]] where each non-[[zero]] [[element]] has a two-sided [[inverse]] (but [[zero]] does not), or equivalently, an [[associative unital algebra|associative unital]] $\mathbb{Z}$-[[reciprocal algebra]] where the multiplicative identity element $1$ is not zero. 

A __division ring__ is a [[unitality|unital]] [[ring]] where each non-[[zero]] [[element]] has a left inverse and a right inverse, or equivalently, an [[associative unital algebra|associative unital]] $\mathbb{Z}$-[[division algebra]] where the multiplicative identity element $1$ is not zero. However in all associative unital division algebras, left and right inverses are the same, for the same reason that associative unital [[quasigroups]] and associative unital [[invertible magmas]] are both [[groups]]. As a result, division rings are the same as skewfields. 

A [[commutative ring|commutative]] skewfield is called a _[[field]]_, but sometimes in specialized works on skewfields one often says simply _field_ for _skewfield_.

In [[constructive mathematics]] and [[internalization|internally]], the same issues appear for skewfields as for [[fields]], and may be dealt with in the same way.

[[linear algebra|Linear algebra]] is often understood in the generality of division rings, namely the usual notions of _[[linear basis]]_, _[[dimension]]_, _[[linear map]]_, [[matrix]] of a linear map with respect to two bases and so on, and even [[Gauss elimination]] procedure, hold without changes for left or right [[vector spaces]] over a division rings.

## Examples

The most famous noncommutative example is the skewfield of [[quaternions]]. 

The [[Frobenius theorem]] states that apart from the fields of [[real number|real]] and [[complex numbers]] and quaternions, there are no associative finite-dimensional [[division algebras]] over the real numbers; and even if one includes nonassociative finite-dimensional division algebras one obtains only one more example (the [[octonions]]). See at _[[normed division algebra]]_ for more on this.

## Idea
 {#Idea}

A _compact Hausdorff space_ or _compactum_, for short, is a [[topological space]] which is both a [[Hausdorff space]] as well as a [[compact space]].
This is precisely the kind of topological space in which every [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of a [[sequence]] or more generally of a [[net]] that should exist does exist ([this prop.](net#CompactSpacesEquivalentlyHaveConvergetSubnets)) and does so uniquely ([this prop](#NetsDetectHausdorff)). 

One may consider the analogous condition for [[convergence spaces]], or for [[locales]] (see also at _[Hausdorff locale](Hausdorff+space#HausdorffLocale)_ and _[[compact locale]]_). Even though these are all different contexts, the resulting notion of compactum is (at least assuming the [[axiom of choice]]) always the same.  Interestingly, there is even an algebraic definition, not one that uses only finitary operations, but one which uses a [[monad]]. 


## Definitions

If you know what a [[compact space]] is and what a [[Hausdorff space]] is, then you know what a compact Hausdorff space is, so let\'s be fancy. (Full justifications will be provided in section on [compacta as algebras](compactum#algebras).) 

Given a [[set]] $S$, let $\beta S$ be the set of [[ultrafilters]] on $S$.  Note that $\beta$ is an [[endofunctor]] on [[Set]]; every [[function]] $f: S \to T$ induces a function $\beta f: \beta S \to \beta T$ using the usual application of functions to [[filters]].  In fact, $\beta$ is a [[monad]]; it comes with a [[natural transformation|natural]] (in $S$) unit $\eta_S: S \to \beta S$, which maps a point $x$ to the [[principal ultrafilter]] that $x$ generates, and multiplication $\mu_S: \beta \beta S \to \beta S$, which maps an ultrafilter $U$ on ultrafilters to the ultrafilter of sets whose principal ultrafilters of ultrafilters belong to $U$.  That is,

*  $ A \in \eta x \;\Leftrightarrow\; x \in A $, so $ \eta x = \{ A \subseteq S \;|\; x \in A \} $;
*  $ A \in \mu U \;\Leftrightarrow\; \{ F \in \beta S \;|\; A \in F \} \in U $.

Then a __compactum__ is simply an [[algebra for a monad|algebra]] for this monad; that is, a set $X$ together with a function $\lim: \beta X \to X$, such that

*  each point $x$ is the limit ($\lim$) of the principal ultrafilter $\eta x$, and
*  given an ultrafilter $U$ on ultrafilters, the limit of $\mu U$ is the limit of $(\beta \lim) U$.

It is then a theorem that this $\lim$ generates a [[convergence space|convergence]] on $S$ that is [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[topological space|topological]].  The converse, that every compact Hausdorff topological convergence is of this form, is equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]].

Every compact Hausdorff space is [[regular space|regular]] and [[sober space|sober]] and so defines a compact regular locale.  Again, the [[axiom of choice]] gives us a converse: every compact regular locale is spatial and so comes from a compactum.
>Probably this is also equivalent to the ultrafilter principle, but I need to check.

Note that every compact Hausdorff space (topological or localic) is not only regular but also [[normal space|normal]]. See _[[compact Hausdorff spaces are normal]]_.


## Compacta as algebras {#algebras} 

Throughout this section, $CH$ will be used to denote the category of compact Hausdorff spaces (compacta). 

### The space of ultrafilters 

Let $Bool$ be the category of [[Boolean algebras]]. The functor $\hom(-, \mathbf{2}): Bool^{op} \to Set$ has a left [[adjoint]] $P: Set \to Bool^{op}$ given by power sets, and we define the **ultrafilter monad** to be the composite $\beta \coloneqq \hom(P -, \mathbf{2})$. 

For a set $S$, [[topology|topologize]] $\beta S$ by declaring a basic [[open set]] to be one of the form 

$$\hat{A} \coloneqq \{F \in \beta S: A \in F\}$$ 

for $A$ a subset of $S$. Notice $\hat{\emptyset}$ is [[empty set|empty]]. Indeed, $\widehat{(-)}$ defines a Boolean algebra map 

$$P(S) \to P(\beta S)$$ 

so that in particular $\widehat{A \cap B} = \hat{A} \cap \hat{B}$, which immediately implies that the $\hat{A}$ form a [[basis]] of a topology. 

+-- {: .num_remark #rem} 
###### Remark 
In fact, $\widehat{(-)}$ is the component at $P(S)$ of the counit of the adjunction $P \dashv \hom(-, \mathbf{2})$, as a morphism in $Bool^{op}$. If $f: S \to T$ is a function, the commutativity of the naturality square 

$$\array{
P(T) & \stackrel{\widehat{(-)}}{\to} & P(\beta T) \\
\mathllap{P(f)} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{P(\beta f)} \\ 
P(S) & \overset{\widehat{(-)}}{\to} & P(\beta S)
}$$

implies that if $U = \hat{B} \in P(\beta T)$ is a basic (cl)open, then so is 
$(\beta f)^{-1}(U) = P(\beta f)(\hat{B}) = \widehat{f^{-1}(B)}$. It then follows that $\beta f$ is continuous. 
=-- 

These results show that the monad $\beta: Set \to Set$ lifts through the forgetful functor $U: Top \to Set$. 

The _unit_ of the monad $\beta$ is given componentwise by functions 

$$prin_X: X \to \beta X$$ 

where $prin_X$ takes $x \in X$ to the principal ultrafilter 

$$prin_X(x) = \{A \in P(X): x \in A\}.$$ 

It is evident that $prin_X$ is injective. 

+-- {: .num_prop #dense} 
###### Proposition 
The injection $prin_X: X \to \beta X$ exhibits $X$ as a [[dense subset]] of $\beta X$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If $\hat{A}$ is a basic open neighborhood containing an ultrafilter $F$, then $A$ is nonempty and hence contains some $x \in X$, which is to say $A \in prin_X(x)$ or that $prin_X(x) \in \hat{A}$. 
=-- 


### Ultrafilters form a compactum 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
$\beta S$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
Let $F, G$ be distinct ultrafilters, so there is $A \subseteq S$ with $A \in F$ and $\neg A \in G$. Then $\hat{A}$ and $\widehat{\neg A}$ are disjoint neighborhoods which contain $F$ and $G$ respectively. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
$\beta S$ is [[compact space|compact]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
It is enough to show that if $\mathcal{O}$ is a collection of opens such that the union of any finite subcollection is a proper subset, then the union of $\mathcal{O}$ is also proper. 

If $\mathcal{O}$ covers $U$, it admits a refinement by basic clopens also covering $U$, and thus we may assume WLOG that $\mathcal{O}$ consists of basic clopens $\hat{A}$. If every finite union of elements of $\mathcal{O}$ is a proper subset of $\beta S$, then every finite intersection $\widehat{\neg A_1} \cap \ldots \cap \widehat{\neg A_n}$ is nonempty, so that the $\neg A$ generate a filter, which is contained in some ultrafilter $F$. This $F$ lies outside the union of all the $\hat{A}$'s. 
=-- 

### Convergence 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition 
Let $X$ be a topological space, and $F$ an ultrafilter on the underlying set $U X$. We say $F$ _converges_ to a point $x$ (in symbols, $F \rightsquigarrow x$) if the [[neighborhood|neighborhood filter]] $N_x$ of $x$ is contained in $F$. 
=-- 

Convergence defines a [[relation]] $\xi$ from $\beta(U X)$ to $U X$. 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
If $X$ is Hausdorff, then the relation $\xi$ is well-defined, or [[functional relation|functional]] (i.e., there is at most one point to which a given ultrafilter $F$ converges). 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If $x \neq y$, then there are disjoint neighborhoods $U$, $V$ of $x$ and $y$. We cannot have both $U \in F$ and $V \in F$ (otherwise $\emptyset = U \cap V$ would be an element of $F$), so at most one of the neighborhood filters $N_x, N_y$ can be contained in $F$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
If $X$ is compact, then the relation $\xi$ is [[total relation|total]] (i.e., there exists a point to which a given ultrafilter $F$ converges). 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If not, then for each $x \in X$ there is an open neighborhood $U_x$ that does not belong to $F$. Then $\neg U_x \in F$. Some finite number of neighborhoods $U_{x_1}, \ldots, U_{x_n}$ covers $X$. Then $\neg U_{x_1} \cap \ldots \cap \neg U_{x_n} = \emptyset \in F$, which is a contradiction. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop #coun} 
###### Proposition 
If $X$ is compact Hausdorff, then the function $\xi: \beta(U X) \to X$ is continuous. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $x \in X$; we must show that $\xi^{-1}(U)$ contains an open neighborhood of any of its points (i.e., ultrafilters $F$ such that $F \rightsquigarrow x$). Since $X$ is $T_3$ ([[separation axioms|Hausdorff regular]]), we may choose a neighborhood $V \in N_x$ whose closure $\bar{V}$ is contained in $U$. Then $\hat{V}$ is an open neighborhood of $F$ in $\beta(U X)$, and we claim $\hat{V} \subseteq \xi^{-1}(U)$. 

For this, we must check that if $G \in \hat{V}$ and $G \rightsquigarrow y$, then $y \in U$. But if $y \in \neg U \subseteq \neg \bar{V}$, then $\neg \bar{V} \in N_y$, whence $G \rightsquigarrow y$ implies $\neg \bar{V} \in G$. This contradicts $G \in \hat{V}$, i.e., contradicts $V \in G$, since $V \cap \neg \bar{V} = \emptyset$. 
=-- 

### Spaces of ultrafilters are universal 

+-- {: .num_prop #exist} 
###### Proposition 
If $S$ is a set and $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, then any function $f: S \to X$ can be extended (along $prin_S: S \to \beta S$) to a continuous function $\hat{f}: \beta S \to X$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We define $\hat{f}$ to be the composite 

$$\beta S \stackrel{\beta(f)}{\to} \beta (U X) \stackrel{\xi}{\to} X$$ 

where $\beta(f)$ is continuous by Remark \ref{rem} and $\xi$ is continuous by Proposition \ref{coun}. It remains to check that the following diagram is commutative: 

$$\array{
S & \stackrel{f}{\to} & U X & & \\
\mathllap{prin_S} \downarrow & & \mathllap{prin_{U X}} \downarrow & \searrow \mathrlap{1_{U X}} & \\
\beta S & \underset{\beta (f)}{\to} & \beta (U X) & \underset{\xi}{\to} & U X.
}$$ 

The square commutes by naturality of $prin$, and commutativity of the triangle simply says that the ultrafilter $prin_{U X}(x)$ converges to $x$, or that $N_x \subseteq prin(x)$, which reduces to the tautology that $x \in V$ for every neighborhood $V \in N_x$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_theorem #free} 
###### Theorem 
For any set $S$, the function $prin_S: S \to \beta S$ is [[universal property|universal]] among functions from $S$ to compact Hausdorff spaces. Hence the functor $F: Set \to CH$ that takes $S$ to the compact Hausdorff space $\beta S$ is [[left adjoint]] to the forgetful functor $CH \to Set$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Proposition \ref{exist} shows that for any function $f: S \to U X$ to a compact Hausdorff space, there exists continuous $g: \beta S \to X$ such that $g \circ prin_S = f$. All that remains is to establish uniqueness of such $g$. But if two maps $g, g': \beta S \to X$ to a Hausdorff space $X$ agree on a dense subspace, in this case the subspace $prin_S : S \hookrightarrow \beta S$ by Proposition \ref{dense}, then they must be equal. Indeed, the pullback of the closed diagonal defines a closed subspace $D$ of $\beta S$,

$$\array{
D & \to & X \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\delta_X} \\
\beta S & \underset{\langle g, g' \rangle}{\to} & X \times X,
}$$ 

and $D$ contains a dense subspace $S$, therefore $D = \beta S$; i.e., the equalizer of $g$ and $g'$ is all of $\beta S$, hence these two maps are equal. 
=-- 

### Compact Hausdorff spaces are monadic over sets 

We recall hypotheses of Beck's precise [[monadicity theorem]]: a functor $U: C \to D$ is monadic if and only if 

1. $U$ has a left adjoint, 

1. $U$ reflects isomorphisms: a morphism $f: X \to Y$ of $C$ is an isomorphism if $U f: U X \to U Y$ is an isomorphism in $D$, 

1. $D$ has, and $U$ preserves, coequalizers of parallel pairs that are $U$-split. (We say 
$$X \stackrel{\overset{f}{\to}}{\underset{g}{\to}} Y$$ 
is $U$-**split** if there is a coequalizer 
$$U X \stackrel{\overset{U f}{\to}}{\underset{U g}{\to}} U Y \stackrel{h}{\to} Z$$ 
that is split in $D$: there exists $i: Z \to U Y$ and $j: U Y \to U X$ such that $U h \circ i = 1_Z$, $U g \circ j = i \circ h$, and $U f \circ j = 1_{U Y}$.) 

In the case where $D = Set$, we have the following useful lemma: 

+-- {: .num_lemma #split} 
###### Lemma 
Suppose given a coequalizer in $Set$ 

$$X \stackrel{\overset{f}{\to}}{\underset{g}{\to}} Y \stackrel{h}{\to} Z$$ 

split by $i: Z \to Y$, $j: Y \to X$ (so that $f j = 1_Y$, $h i = 1_Z$, $g j = i h$). Let $R \hookrightarrow Y \times Y$ be the image of $\langle f, g \rangle : X \to Y \times Y$, and let $\langle p_1, p_2 \rangle : E \to Y \times Y$ be the equivalence relation given by the kernel pair $(p_1, p_2)$ of $h$. Then $E = R \cdot R^{op}$, the relational composite given by taking the image of the [[span]] composite $R \times_Y R^{op} \to Y \times Y$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Clearly $R \subseteq E$ since $h f = h g$, and we have $R^{op} \subseteq E^{op} = E$ and $R \cdot R^{op} \subseteq E \cdot E \subseteq E$ by symmetry and transitivity of $E$. In the other direction, suppose $(y_1, y_3) \in E$, so that $h(y_1) = h(y_3)$. Put $x = j(y_1)$ and $x' = j(y_3)$ (so that $f(x) = y_1$ and $f(x') = y_3$), and put $y_2 = g(x)$. Clearly then $(y_1, y_2) \in R$. Moreover, 

$$y_2 = g(x) = g j(y_1) = i h(y_1) = i h(y_3) =  g j(y_3) = g(x')$$ 

so that $(y_3, y_2) \in R$, or $(y_2, y_3) \in R^{op}$. Hence $(y_1, y_3) \in R \cdot R^{op}$, and we have shown $E \subseteq R \cdot R^{op}$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
The forgetful functor $U: CH \to Set$ is monadic. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
By theorem \ref{free}, $U$ has a [[left adjoint]]. Since [[bijection|bijective]] continuous maps between compact Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphisms, we have that $U$ reflects isomorphisms. Finally, suppose $(f, g)$ is a $U$-split pair of morphisms $X \to Y$ in $CH$; let $h: Y \to Z$ be their coequalizer in $Top$, given by a suitable quotient space. Being a quotient of a compact space, $Z$ is compact. Since $CH$ is a full subcategory of $Top$, the map $h$ is a coequalizer in $CH$ once we prove the following claim:  

* **Claim:** $Z$ is Hausdorff. 

Furthermore, since the forgetful functor $Top \to Set$ has a right adjoint (given by taking indiscrete topologies on sets), the underlying function of $h$ (again denoted $h$) is the coequalizer of $(U f, U g)$ in $Set$, so that $U$ would preserve the claimed coequalizer. 

In other words, to complete the proof, it suffices to verify the claim. Letting $p_0, p_1: E \stackrel{\to}{\to} Y$ be the kernel pair of $h$ in $Top$, to show $Z = Y/E$ is Hausdorff, it suffices to prove that the equivalence relation $\langle p_0, p_1 \rangle : E \to Y \times Y$ in $Top$ is closed. Let $R \hookrightarrow Y \times Y$ be the image of $\langle f, g \rangle: X \to Y \times Y$. By lemma \ref{split}, the subset $E$ of $U Y \times U Y$ coincides with the subset $R \cdot R^{op} \subseteq U Y \times U Y$. Now $R$ is the image of the compact space $X$ under the continuous map $\langle f, g \rangle$, so $R$ is a closed subset of $Y \times Y$. Similarly $R^{op}$ is a closed subset of $Y \times Y$. Under their subspace topologies, their fiber product $R \times_Y R^{op}$ is compact, and so its image $R \cdot R^{op}$ under the (continuous) span composite $R \times_Y R^{op} \to Y \times Y$ is also closed. This completes the proof. 
=-- 


## Weak versions

Every [[Hausdorff space]], hence every compactum, satisfies the [[separation axiom]] $T_0$.  As is usual with separation axioms, we can also look for a non-$T_0$ version.  A priori, this is a compact [[preregular space]]; however, since every such space is [[regular space|regular]], we can speak instead of a __compact regular space__.

In the absence of the axiom of choice, and especially in [[constructive mathematics]], the best definition of compactum seems to be a compact regular locale.  That is, it is the category of compact regular locales that has all of the nice properties, forming a [[nice category of spaces]], and that has the desired examples, such as the [[unit interval]].  (See the discussion at [[Tychonoff theorem]] for an example of how the category of compact Hausdorff topological spaces might fail to be nice; see [Frank Waaldijk's PhD thesis](http://www.fwaaldijk.nl/foundations%20of%20constructive%20mathematics.pdf) (pdf) for a thorough discussion of what is needed to make the unit interval a compact Hausdorff topological space.)

The monadic definition, in particular, falls quite flat without some form of the axiom of choice; even [[excluded middle]] and [[COSHEP]] are powerless here.  In fact, it is quite consistent to assume that every ultrafilter is principal (a strong denial of the ultrafilter principle), in which case $\beta$ is the [[identity monad]].  Then a compactum would be just a set if that were the definition used.

On the other hand, it is the monadic definition that gives an [[algebraic category]] with a nice relationship to [[Set]].  Without the ultrafilter principle, there is no reason to think that the set-of-points functor from compact regular locales to sets is even [[continuous functor|continuous]].

### Stone--&#268;ech compactification
 {#StoneCechCompactification}

By general nonsense, every $\beta S$, regarded as a free $\beta$-algebra, is a compactum, and the functor 

$$\beta: Set \to Comp$$ 

is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] $Comp \to Set$.  Assuming the ultrafilter principle, this functor extends to a functor $\beta: Top \to Comp$ (identifying a set with its [[discrete space]]) that is left adjoint to the forgetful functor $Comp \to Top$.  This is the __[[Stone–Čech compactification]]__ functor (N.B.: for many authors, Stone--&#268;ech compactification refers to the restriction of this functor to [[Tychonoff spaces]] $X$, which are precisely those spaces where the unit $X \to \beta X$ is an [[embedding]] so that we have a [[compactification]] in the technical sense).

A classical construction of the Stone--&#268;ech compactification starts with the unit [[interval]] $I =[0, 1]$ and proceeds to the [[codensity monad]] induced from the functor 

$$\hom(-, I) \colon Top^{op} \to Set.$$ 

The monad is given on objects by $X \mapsto I^{\hom(X, I)}$; this lands in compact Hausdorff spaces under the ultrafilter principle. Let $\bar{X}$ be the closure of the [[image]] of the unit $u_X: X \to I^{\hom(X, I)}$; this $\bar{X}$ is compact Hausdorff. 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
If $X$ is a [[Tychonoff space]], then the unit $u_X: X \to I^{\hom(X, I)}$ is a subspace embedding, so that $I$ is a [[cogenerator]] in the category of Tychonoff spaces. (In particular, $u_C$ is an embedding if $C$ is compact Hausdorff, so $I$ is also a [[cogenerator]] in the category of compact Hausdorff spaces.)  
=-- 

The proof is essentially [[Urysohn's lemma]]; see also related discussion at [[Tychonoff space]] and at [[uniform space]] (noting that compact Hausdorff spaces are uniform spaces for a unique uniformity). 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
The natural map $i_X: X \to \bar{X}$ is universal among maps from $X$ to compact Hausdorff spaces, thus giving a [[left adjoint]] $Top \to Comp$ to the (fully faithful) forgetful functor $U: Comp \to Top$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $f: X \to C$ be a map, where $C$ is a compact Hausdorff space. Since $I$ is a cogenerator in the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the unit for the codensity monad $M_I$,

$$u_C: C \to I^{\hom(C, I)},$$ 

is a continuous injection (and hence a closed subspace embedding, since $C$ is compact Hausdorff). Let $\hat{f} = M_I(f)$, and consider the pullback square 

$$\array{
\hat{f}^{-1}(C) & \to & I^{\hom(X, I)} \\
\mathllap{\pi} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\hat{f}} \\ 
C & \underset{u_C}{\to} & I^{\hom(C, I)}.
}$$ 

From an evident naturality square for the unit $u$, we have a map $h: X \to \hat{f}^{-1}(C)$, i.e., the map $u_X: X \to I^{\hom(X, I)}$ factors through the closed subspace $\hat{f}^{-1}(C) \hookrightarrow I^{\hom(X, I)}$. Therefore $h$ factors as 

$$X \stackrel{i_X}{\to} \bar{X} \subseteq \hat{f}^{-1}(C)$$ 

and since $\pi \circ h = f$, we conclude that $f$ factors through $i_X$. And moreover, there is at most one $k: \bar{X} \to C$ such that $k \circ i_X = f$, because $i_X$ maps $X$ onto a dense subspace of $\bar{X}$, and dense subspaces are epic in the category of Hausdorff spaces. This completes the proof. 
=-- 


We have a similar Stone--&#268;ech compactification functor $Loc \to Comp$; we do not need the ultrafilter principle here if $Comp$ is defined in terms of locales.

### Category of compacta 

The category $Comp$ of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps is 

* [[exact category|Barr exact]], since $U: Comp \to Set$ is monadic, 

* an [[extensive category]], and 

* a [[total category]] (by monadicity over $Set$), and 

* a [[total category|cototal category]] (because it is [[complete category|complete]], [[well-powered category|well-powered]], and has a [[cogenerator]] given by the unit interval $I = [0, 1]$). 

From the first two properties, it follows that $Comp$ is a [[pretopos]], meaning that $Comp$ enjoys the same finitary exactness properties that hold in a [[topos]]; in particular, first-order intuitionistic logic may be enacted within $Comp$. 

In ([Marra-Reggio 18](#MarraReggio)), the authors give a characterization of $Comp$ up to equivalence as the unique non-trivial [[pretopos]] which is [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]], [[filtrality|filtral]] and admits all set-indexed [[copowers]] of its [[terminal object]]. They contrast this result with Lawvere’s characterisation of the category of sets in [[ETCS]], noting that the main divergence concerns

> the existence of infinite “discrete” objects. While the third axiom of ETCS postulates the existence of a natural numbers object, we prescribe filtrality which forbids the existence of infinite discrete objects. ([Marra-Reggio 18, p. 2](#MarraReggio))

In the context of [[ultracategories]], $Comp$ is equivalent to $Fun_{RUlt}(\ast, Set)$, the category of right ultrafunctors between the terminal ultracategory and $Set$ ([Lurie, p. 4](#Lurie)). 

The [[infinitary pretopos]] of [[condensed sets]]
is the completion of the [[pretopos]] of [[compact Hausdorff spaces]].

### Relation to compactly generated topological spaces

\begin{proposition}\label{kSpacesAreTheColimitsInTopOfCompactHausdorffSpaces}
**([[k-spaces]] are the [[Top#UniversalConstructions|colimits in Top]] of [[compact Hausdorff spaces]])**
\linebreak
  A [[topological space]] is a [[k-space]] (Def. \ref{kSpace})
iff it is a [[colimit]] as formed in [[Top]] (according to [this Prop.](Top#DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop)) of a [[diagram]] of [[compact Hausdorff spaces]].
\end{proposition}
([Escardo, Lawson & Simpson 2004, Lem. 3.2 (v)](#EscardoLawsonSimpson04))

Such colimits of compact Hausdorff spaces are also equivalently [[quotient topological spaces]] of [[locally compact Hausdorff spaces]], see [there](locally+compact+topological+space#kSpacesAreTheQuotientSpacesOfLocallyCompactHausdorffSpaces).

## Definition 

A **strong epimorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[epimorphism]] which is left [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to any [[monomorphism]] in $C$.

## Properties

* The composition of  strong epimorphisms is a strong epimorphism. If $f\circ g$ is a strong epimorphism, then $f$ is a strong epimorphism.

* If $C$ has [[equalizers]], then any morphism which is left orthogonal to all monomorphisms must automatically be an epimorphism.

* Every [[regular epimorphism]] is strong.  The converse is true if $C$ is [[regular category|regular]].

* Every strong epimorphism is [[extremal epimorphism|extremal]].  The converse is true if $C$ has [[pullback]]s.

## In higher category theory

A [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category]] is a [[n-truncated|(-1)-truncated]] morphism in an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$. 

Therefore it makes sense to define an **strong epimorphism in an $(\infty,1)$-category** to be a morphism that is part of the left half of an [[orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category]] whose right half is that of $(-1)$-[[truncated]] morphisms.

If $C$ is an [[(∞,1)-topos]] then it has an [[n-connected/n-truncated factorization system]] for all $n$. The $(-1)$-[[connected]] morphisms are also called [[effective epimorphism]]s. Therefore in an $(\infty,1)$-topos strong epimorphisms again coincide with effective epimorphisms.

## Idea

The [[quotient]] of a [[ring]] by an [[ideal]].

## Definition

### Quotient by two-sided ideals

Given a [[ring]] $R$ and a [[two-sided ideal]] $I$ with canonical $R$-$R$-[[bimodule monomorphism]] $i:I \hookrightarrow R$, the quotient of $R$ by $I$ is the [[initial object|initial]] two-sided $R$-[[associative unital algebra|algebra]] $R/I$ with canonical [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R/I$ such that for every element $a \in I$, $h(i(a)) = 0$: for any other $R$-algebra $S$ with canonical ring homomorphism $k:R \to S$ such that for every element $a \in I$, $k(i(a)) = 0_S$, there is a unique ring homomorphism $l:R/I \to S$ such that $l \circ h = k$. 

### Quotient by left ideals

Given a [[ring]] $R$ and a [[left ideal]] $I$ with canonical left $R$-[[module]] [[monomorphism]] $i:I \hookrightarrow R$, the quotient of $R$ by $I$ is the [[initial object|initial]] left $R$-[[associative unital algebra|algebra]] $R/I$ with canonical [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R/I$ such that for every element $a \in I$, $h(i(a)) = 0$: for any other $R$-algebra $S$ with canonical ring homomorphism $k:R \to S$ such that for every element $a \in I$, $k(i(a)) = 0_S$, there is a unique ring homomorphism $l:R/I \to S$ such that $l \circ h = k$. 

### Quotient by right ideals

Given a [[ring]] $R$ and a [[right ideal]] $I$ with canonical right $R$-[[module]] [[monomorphism]] $i:I \hookrightarrow R$, the quotient of $R$ by $I$ is the [[initial object|initial]] right $R$-[[associative unital algebra|algebra]] $R/I$ with canonical [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R/I$ such that for every element $a \in I$, $h(i(a)) = 0$: for any other $R$-algebra $S$ with canonical ring homomorphism $k:R \to S$ such that for every element $a \in I$, $k(i(a)) = 0_S$, there is a unique ring homomorphism $l:R/I \to S$ such that $l \circ h = k$.

## Idea

The _kernel_ of a [[morphism]] is that part of its [[domain]] which is sent to [[zero]].


## Definition

There are various definitions of the notion of kernel, depending on the properties and structures available in the ambient category. We list a few definitions and discuss (in parts) when they are equivalent.

### As a pullback 


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

In a [[category]] with an [[initial object]] $0$ and [[pullbacks]], the __kernel__ $ker(f)$ of a [[morphism]] $f: A \to B$ is the [[pullback]] $ker(f) \to A$ along $f$ of the unique morphism $0 \to B$

$$
  \array{
    ker(f)
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

More explicitly, this characterizes the object $ker(f)$ as [[generalized the|the]] object (unique up to unique [[isomorphism]]) that satisfies the following [[universal property]]:

for every object $C$ and every morphism $h : C \to A$ such that $f\circ h = 0$ is the [[zero morphism]], there is a unique morphism $\phi : C \to ker(f)$ such that $h = p\circ \phi$.

=--


### As an equalizer

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


In a [[category]] with [[zero morphism]]s (meaning: [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[category of pointed sets]]), [[generalized the|the]] **kernel** $ker(f)$ of a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ is, if it exists, the [[equalizer]] of $f$ and the zero morphism $0_{c,d}$.  

=--

### As a weighted limit 

In any category enriched over pointed sets, the kernel of a morphism $f:c\to d$ is the universal morphism $k:a\to c$ such that $f \circ k$ is the basepoint.  It is a [[weighted limit]] in the sense of [[enriched category theory]].  This applies in particular in any (pre)-[[additive category]].

This is a special case of the construction of [[generalized kernels]] in enriched categories.

### As a representing object

Let $Ab$ be the category of abelian groups. It is a category with kernels. In  every $Ab$-enriched category $A$, for every morphism $f: X\to Y$ in $A$ there is a [[subfunctor]] 

$$ker f : A^{op}\to Ab$$

of the representable functor $hom(-,X)$, defined on objects by

$$ (ker f)(Z) = ker(hom(Z,X)\to hom(Z,Y)), $$

where $ker$ on the right-hand side is the kernel n the category of abelian groups.

If the category is in fact preabelian, $ker f$ is also representable with representing object $Ker f$. One has to be careful with $Coker f$ which does not represent the functor naive  $coker f$ defined as $(coker f)(Z) = coker(hom(Z,X)\to hom(Z,Y))$ in $Ab$,
which is often not representable at all, even in the simple example of the category of abelian groups.  Instead, as a colimit construction, one should *co*represent another functor, namely, the covariant functor $Z\mapsto ker(hom(Y,Z) \to hom(X,Z))$ (which is a quotient of the corepresentable functor $hom(X,-)$). In short, $Coker f$ is defined by the double dualization using the kernel in $Ab$: $Coker f = (Ker f^{op})^{op}$.  This is a particular case of the dualization involved in defining any [[colimit]] from its corresponding [[limit]].

### In an $(\infty,1)$-category 

The kernel of a morphism in an [[(∞,1)-category]] with $\infty$-categorical [[zero object]] is the [[homotopy pullback]] as in the pullback definition above: the [[homotopy fiber]]. 

See also [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

### Other meanings 

In some fields, the term 'kernel' refers to an [[equivalence relation]] that category theorists would see as a [[kernel pair]].  This is especially important in fields such as [[monoid]] theory where both notions exist but are not equivalent (while in [[group]] theory they are equivalent).

In [[ring]] theory, even when one assumes that rings have units preserved by ring homomorphisms, the traditional notion of kernel (an [[ideal]]) exists in the category of non-unital rings (and is not itself a unital ring in general).  A purely category-theoretic theory of unital rings can be recovered either by using the kernel pair instead or (to fit better the usual language) moving to a category of [[modules]].

In [[universal algebra]], this may be handled in the framework of [[Malcev variety|Mal'cev varieties]].

Kashiwara-Schapira, following the terminology of EGA, uses kernel as a synonym of equalizer (and co-kernel of co-equalizer).

## Properties {#Properties}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Property

Let $C$ be a category with [[pullback]]s and [[zero object]].

In $C$, the kernel of a kernel is 0.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/pullback#Pasting">pasting law for pullbacks</a> we have that the total square

$$
  \array{
     ker ker f &\to& ker f  &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     0 &\to& c &\stackrel{f}{\to}& d
  }
$$

is a pullback. Since $0 \to c$ is a [[monomorphism]] and the pullback of a monomorphism along itself is the domain of the monomorphis, we have $ker ker f \simeq 0$.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This statement crucially fails to be true in [[higher category theory]]. There, the kernel of a kernel is the based [[loop space object]] of $d$. For this reason where one has [[short exact sequence]]s in 1-category theory, there are instead long [[fiber sequence]]s in higher category theory.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

In a category $C$ with [[pullback]]s and [[pushout]]s and [[zero object]], kernel and [[cokernel]] form a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s on the [[arrow category|arrow categories]]

$$
  (coker \dashv ker) : Arr(C) \stackrel{\overset{coker}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{ker}{\to}} Arr(C)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


We check the hom-isomorphism of a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s. An element in the [[hom-set]] $Arr_C(g,ker f)$ is a [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     c &\to& ker(f) &\to& 0
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     d &\to& a &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the universal property of the [[pullback]], this is the same as a diagram

$$
  \array{
     c  &\to& &\to& 0
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && && \downarrow
     \\
     d &\to& a &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the dual reasoning, an element in $Arr_C(coker g, f)$ is a diagram

$$
  \array{
    c &\stackrel{g}{\to}& d &\to& a
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    0 &\to& coker g &\to& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the universal property of the [[pushout]] this is equivalently a diagram

$$
  \array{
    c &\stackrel{g}{\to}& d &\to& a
    \\
    \downarrow &&  && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    0 &\to&  &\to& b
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

(This also follows from the general theory of [[generalized kernels]].)

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

In the [[category]] [[Ab]] of abelian groups, the kernel of a [[group homomorphism]] $f : A \to B$ is the [[subgroup]] of $A$ on the set $f^{-1}(0)$ of elements of $A$ that are sent to the zero-element of $B$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example


More generally, for $R$ any [[ring]], this is true in $R$[[Mod]]: the kernel of a morphism of modules is the [[preimage]] of the zero-element at the level of the underlying sets, equipped with the unique sub-module structure on that set.

## Idea

The notion of _cofibration_ is [[duality|dual]] to that of _[[fibration]]_. See there for more details.

A _cofibration_ is a member of a distinguished *class of cofibrations* in one of the several setups in [[homotopy theory]]:

* [[model category|Quillen categories]] of models for homotopy theory

* the [[category with cofibrations|categories with cofibrations]] of Baues

* [[Waldhausen categories]]

In traditional [[topology]], one usually means a [[Hurewicz cofibration]]. 

In [[category theory]] and [[descent theory]], Grothendieck however introduced a notion of cofibered category or cofibration, whose definition is categorically dual to that of a [[fibered category]] and based on the generalization of the universal property of coCartesian squares; however it does not correspond to the extension property in topology, but to a lifting property, like for [[fibration]]s. For that reason, Gray suggested (and this is to some extent adopted in $n$lab) to call such categories [[opfibration]]s. In the [[quasicategory|quasicategorical]] setup, the generalizations of fibered categories are called [[Cartesian fibration]]s, and the generalizations of op/co-fibered categories are called coCartesian fibrations. 
In the $1$-categorical setup, the coCartesian arrows in op/co-fibrations are indeed the ones which complete coCartesian squares in the special and most important case of [[domain opfibration]]s.


## Examples
 {#Examples}

* [[relative cell complex]] inclusions are the cofibrations in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]]

* closed [[Hurewicz cofibration]] are the cofibrations in  in the [[Strøm's model category]] on  [[Top]]

* [[monomorphisms]] are the cofibrations in [[Cisinski model structures]] such as the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]]

## Stability properties

Cofibrations are _usually_ defined in such a way that they are stable at least under the following operations in the category under consideration

 * composition 
 * pushouts of spans at least one of whose legs is a cofibration

(Please mind the precise definitions of the category you are using. 
Also compare the stability properties of the dual notion [[fibration]].)

## Definition

Given a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$, the _metric topology_ on $X$ is the structure of a [[topological space]] $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ which is generated from the [[topological base]] of $\mathcal{T}$ given by the [[open balls]] 

$$
  B(x,r) \coloneqq \{y \in X \;|\; d(x,y) \lt r \}
$$

for all $x \in X$ and $r \in (0,\infty) \subset \mathbb{R}$.

A topological space whose topology is the metric topology for some [[metric space]] structure on its underlying set is called a _[[metrizable topological space]]_.

## Definition

For $f : X \to Y$ a [[smooth function]], a **critical point** is a point $x \in X$ at which the [[derivative]] $d f : T X \to T Y$ has [[rank]] strictly less than the [[dimension]] of $Y$.

The collection of all critical points is also called the **critical locus** of $f$.

The $f$-image of a critical point is known as a __[[critical value]]__.
A point in $Y$ that is not a [[critical value]] is known as a __[[regular value]]__.

A formalization of this in [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesive geometry]] is at _[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos -- infinitesimal cohesion -- critical locus](cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos+--+infinitesimal+cohesion#CriticalLocus)_.

## Applications

* Critical loci are used to study [[topology]] in terms of [[Morse theory]].

* Critical loci of [[functionals]] on [[jet bundles]] are studied in [[variational calculus]]. See also at _[[shell]]_.

## Idea

Given a [[function]] $f$ of $n$ [[variables]], and given $n$ functions $\{g_i\}$ of one variable, then the _total derivative_ of the composite function $t \mapsto f(g_1(t),\cdots, g_n(t))$ is (if it exists) simply its [[derivative]] with respect to $t$, but understood as a [[linear combination]]of the [[partial derivatives]] of $f$, via the [[chain rule]]:

$$
  \frac{d f}{d t}
    =
  \sum_i
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial g_i}
  \,
  \frac{d g_i}{d t}
  \,.

## Idea

Given a [[group]] $G$ and a [[subgroup]] $H$, then their _coset object_ is the [[quotient]] $G/H$, hence the set of [[equivalence classes]] of elements of $G$ where two are regarded as equivalent if they differ by right multiplication with an element in $H$.

If $G$ is a [[topological group]], then the quotient is a [[topological space]] and usually called the _coset space_. This is in particular a [[homogeneous space]], see there for more.

## Definition

### Internal to a general category

In a category $C$, for $G$ a [[group object]] and $H \hookrightarrow G$ a [[subgroup|subgroup object]], the left/right _object of cosets_ is the [[orbit|object of orbits]] of $G$ under left/right multiplication by $H$.

Explicitly, the left coset space $G/H$ [[coequalizes]] the parallel morphisms
$$
  H \times G \underoverset{\mu}{proj_G}\rightrightarrows G 
$$ 
where $\mu$ is (the inclusion $H\times G \hookrightarrow G\times G$ composed with) the group multiplication.  

Simiarly, the right coset space $H\backslash G$ [[coequalizes]] the parallel morphisms
$$
  G \times H \underoverset{proj_G}{\mu}\rightrightarrows G 
$$ 

### Internal to $Set$

Specializing the above definition to the case where $C$ is the well-pointed topos $Set$, given an element $g$ of $G$, its orbit $g H$ is an element of $G/H$ and is called a _left coset_.

Using [[comprehension]], we can write

$$
  G/H = \{g H | g \in G\}
$$

Similarly there is a coset on the right $H \backslash G$.

### For Lie groups and Klein geometry

If $H \hookrightarrow G$ is an inclusion of [[Lie groups]] then the quotient $G/H$ is also called a _[[Klein geometry]]_.

### For $\infty$-groups
 {#ForInfinityGroups}

More generally, given an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ and a [[homomorphism]] of  [[∞-group]] objects $H \to G$, hence equivalently a morphism of their [[deloopings]]
$\mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G$, then the [[homotopy quotient]] $G/H$ is given by the [[homotopy fiber]] of this map

$$
  \array{
    G/H &\longrightarrow& \mathbf{B}H
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.
$$

See at _[[∞-action]]_ for more on this definition. See at _[[higher Klein geometry]]_ and _[[higher Cartan geometry]]_ for the corresponding concepts of [[higher geometry]].

## Properties 

### For normal subgroups

The coset inherits the structure of a group if $H$ is a [[normal subgroup]].

Unless $G$ is abelian, considering both left and right coset spaces provide different information.

### As a homotopy fiber

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In [[geometric homotopy theory]] (in an [[(∞,1)-topos]]), for $H \longrightarrow G$ any homomorphisms of [[∞-group]] objects, then the natural projection $G \longrightarrow G/H$, generally realizes $G$ as an $H$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] over $G/H$. This is exhibited by a [[homotopy pullback]] of the form

$$
  \array{
   G & \longrightarrow &* 
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   G/H &\longrightarrow& \mathbf{B}H
  }
  \,.
$$

where $\mathbf{B}H$ is the [[delooping|delooping groupoid]] of $H$. This also equivalently exhibits the [[∞-action]] of $H$ on $G$ (see there for more).

By the [[pasting law]] for [[homotopy pullbacks]] then we get the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
   G/H & \longrightarrow &\mathbf{B}H 
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   * & \longrightarrow & \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

which exhibits the coset as the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G$.

## Examples

### $n$-Spheres

+-- {: .num_example #nSphereAsCosetSpace}
###### Example

The [[n-spheres]] are coset spaces of [[orthogonal groups]]:

$$
  S^n \simeq O(n+1)/O(n)
  \,.
$$

The odd-dimensional spheres are also coset spaces of [[unitary groups]]:

$$
  S^{2n+1}
  \simeq
  U(n+1)/U(n)
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

Fix a [[unit vector]] in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Then its [[orbit]] under the defining $O(n+1)$-[[action]] on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is clearly the canonical embedding $S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. But precisely the subgroup of $O(n+1)$ that consists of rotations around the axis formed by that unit vector [[stabilizer group|stabilizes]] it, and that subgroup is isomorphic to $O(n)$, hence $S^n \simeq O(n+1)/O(n)$.

The second statement follows by the same kind of reasoning:

Clearly $U(n+1)$ [[transitive action|acts transitively]] on the [[unit sphere]] $S^{2n+1}$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. It remains to see that its [[stabilizer subgroup]] of any point on this sphere is $U(n)$. If we take the point with [[coordinates]] $(1,0, 0, \cdots,0)$ and regard elements of $U(n+1)$ as [[matrices]], then the stabilizer subgroup consists of matrices of the block diagonal form

$$
  \left(
    \array{
      1 & \vec 0
      \\
      \vec 0 & A
    }
  \right)
$$

where $A \in U(n)$.

There are also various exceptional realizations of spheres as coset spaces. For instance:

### Sequences of coset spaces
 {#QuotientMapsOfCosetSpaces}

Consider $K \hookrightarrow H \hookrightarrow G$ two consecutive group inclusions with their induced coset [[quotient]] [[projections]]

$$
  \array{
    H/K & \longrightarrow&  G/K 
    \\
    && \downarrow 
    \\
    && G/H
  }
  \,.
$$

When $G/K \to G/H$ is a [[Serre fibration]], for instance in the situation of prop. \ref{ProjectionOfCosetsIsFiberBundleForClosedSubgroupsOfCompactLieGroup} (so that this is indeed a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] with respect to the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]]) then it induces the corresponding [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]]

$$
  \cdots
  \to 
  \pi_{n+1}(G/H)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_n(H/K) \longrightarrow \pi_n(G/K) \longrightarrow \pi_n(G/H)
  \longrightarrow 
  \pi_{n-1}(H/K)
  \to \cdots
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .num_example #CofiberSequencesOfCosetsOfOrthogonalGroups}
###### Example

Consider a sequence of inclusions of [[orthogonal groups]] of the form

$$
  O(n) \hookrightarrow O(n+1) \hookrightarrow O(n+k)
  \,.
$$

Then by example \ref{nSphereAsCosetSpace} we have that $O(n+1)/O(n) \simeq S^n$ is the [[n-sphere]] and by corollary \ref{QuotientProjectionForCompactLieSubgroupIsPrincipal} the quotient map is a [[Serre fibration]]. Hence there is a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] of the form 

$$
  \cdots
  \to 
  \pi_q(S^n) 
  \longrightarrow \pi_q(O(n+k)/O(n)) \longrightarrow \pi_q(O(n+k)/O(n+1))
  \longrightarrow 
  \pi_{q-1}(S^n)
  \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

Now for $q \lt n$ then $\pi_q(S^n) = 0$ and hence in this range we have [[isomorphisms]]

$$
  \pi_{\bullet \lt n}(O(n+k)/O(n)) 
     \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet \lt n}(O(n+k)/O(n+1))
 \,.
$$

## Idea

For $R \hookrightarrow A$ an [[associative algebra]] over a [[ring]] $R$ equipped with the structure of an [[augmented algebra]] $\epsilon \colon A \to R$, the _augmentation ideal_ is the [[kernel]] of $\epsilon$.

Specifically for $G$ a [[group]], and $R[G]$ its [[group algebra]] over a [[ring]] $R$, the _augmentation ideal_ is the [[ideal]] in $R[G]$ which consists of those [[formal linear combinations]] over $R$ of elements in $G$ whose sum of [[coefficients]] vanishes in $R$.

## Examples

### For group algebras

Let $G$ be a [[discrete group]] and $R$ a [[ring]]. Write $R[G]$ for the [[group algebra]] of $G$ over $R$.

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Write

$$
  \epsilon \colon \mathbb{Z}[G] \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

for the [[homomorphism]] of [[abelian groups]] which forms the sum of $R$-[[coefficients]] of the [[formal linear combinations]] that constitute the group ring

$$
  \epsilon \colon r \mapsto \sum_{g \in G} r_g
  \,. 
$$

This is called the [[augmentation]] map. Its [[kernel]]

$$
  ker(\epsilon) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}[G]
$$

is the **augmentation ideal** of $\mathbb{Z}[G]$. (It is often denoted by $I(G)$.

## Properties

### General 

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The augmentation ideal is indeed a left and right [[ideal]] in $R[G]$.

### For group algebras

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The $R$-[[module]] underlying the augmentation ideal of a [[group algebra]] is a [[free module]], free on the set of elements

$$
  \{
    g - e | g \in G,\; g \neq e
  \}
$$

in $R[G]$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition
(For the case $R= \mathbb{Z}$)

As a $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-module, considered with the same generators, the relations are generated by those of the form 

$$g_1(g_2-e)= (g_1g_2-e)-(g_1-e).$$

> This entry is about the notion of _skeleton_ in [[category theory]]. For the notion of (co)skeletal [[simplicial sets]] see at _[[simplicial skeleton]]_.

# Contents
* table of contents
{:toc}

## Definition
 {#Definition}

A [[strict category]] is called __skeletal__ if [[objects]] that are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] are necessarily [[equality|equal]], hence if all its [[isomorphisms]] are [[automorphisms]]. 

(If in addition all isomorphisms are in fact [[identity morphisms]], then one speaks of a *[[gaunt category]]*.)

A __skeleton__ of a category $C$ is defined to be a skeletal [[subcategory]] of $C$ whose [[inclusion functor]] exhibits it as [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $C$. A __weak skeleton__ of $C$ is any skeletal category which is [[equivalence of categories|weakly equivalent]] to $C$.

In the absence of the [[axiom of choice]], it is more appropriate to define a __skeleton__ of $C$ to be a weak skeleton as defined above.

## Constructions

In this section, we work in [[set-level foundations]] to construct skeleta of categories and more general objects.

### Existence of Skeletons of Categories

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then every category $C$ has a skeleton (in the strongest sense).
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Simply choose one object in each isomorphism class and one isomorphism to that object from each other object in that class.

In more detail, generate the full subcategory $sk(C)$ containing just the chosen objects. Denote by $in\colon sk(C)\to C$ the inclusion. We exhibit a weak inverse of $in$ as a functor
$-':x\mapsto x'$ constructed as follows. For every object $x$ one has chosen already the unique object $x'$ in $sk(X)$ isomorphic to $x$, but one also needs to make a choice of isomorphism $i_x\colon x\to x'$ for every $x$. This enables to conjugate between $C(x,y)$ and $C(x',y')$ by 

$$
(x\stackrel{f}\to y)\mapsto (x'\stackrel{i_x^{-1}}\to x\stackrel{f}\to y\stackrel{i_y}\to y').
$$ 

The rule for *morphisms* $-': f\mapsto f' := i_y\circ f\circ i_{x}^{-1}$ is clearly functorial. Let us show that $-'$ is a weak inverse of $in$. In one direction, given $y\in sk(C)$ we compute $(in_{y})' = y$ (strict equality); in another direction, given $x\in C$, notice that $i^{-1}_{in_{x'}}:in_{x'}\cong x$  for $x\in C$ is an isomorphism. It suffices to show that these isomorphisms for all $x\in C$ together form a *natural* isomorphism $i^{-1}_{in}:in_{-'}\to id_C$; the naturality diagram is commutative precisely because of the conjugation formula for the functor $-'$ for morphisms. This completes the proof that $-'$ is indeed a weak inverse of $in$.
=--

In fact, the statement that every (possibly [[small category|small]]) category has a skeleton is _equivalent_ to the axiom of choice if "subcategory" and "equivalence" have their naive ('strong') meanings.  For given a [[surjection]] $p:A\to B$ in $Set$, make $A$ into a category with a unique isomorphism $a\cong a'$ iff $p(a)=p(a')$; then a skeleton of $A$ supplies a splitting of $p$.

Even with the more general notion of weak or ana-[[equivalence of categories]], some amount of choice is required to show that every category has a skeleton.  It would be interesting to know the precise strength of the statement "every category is weakly equivalent to a skeletal one."  

### Skeletons as an Endo-Pseudofunctor on $\mathfrak{Cat}$

In the presence of choice we can thusly turn the process of taking the skeleton of a category into an endo-pseudofunctor on $\mathfrak{Cat}$, the $2$-category of categories.

For each category $\mathcal{C}$ let $sk_\mathcal{C}$ denote a skeleton of $\mathcal{C}$ and let $E_\mathcal{C}:sk_\mathcal{C}\simeq\mathcal{C}:E_\mathcal{C}^{\sim1}$ denote the skeletal equivalence at $\mathcal{C}$, with $\epsilon^{sk}_\mathcal{C}:E_\mathcal{C}\circ E^{\sim1}_\mathcal{C}\Rightarrow1_\mathcal{C}$ the skeletal transformation at $\mathcal{C}$. We define an endo-pseudofunctor 

$$
sk:\mathfrak{Cat}\to\mathfrak{Cat}
$$ 

as follows:

1. $sk(\mathcal{C})=sk_\mathcal{C},$
1. $sk(F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D})=E^{\sim1}_\mathcal{D}\circ F\circ E_\mathcal{C}:sk_\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}\to sk_\mathcal{D},$
1. $sk(\alpha:F\Rightarrow G)=i\circ\alpha\circ i^{-1}:sk(F)\Rightarrow sk(G),$ where 
$$
i\circ\alpha\circ i^{-1}:sk(F)\Rightarrow sk(G)
$$ 
is defined by 
$$
(i\circ\alpha\circ i^{-1})_X=i_{G(X)}\circ\alpha_X\circ i_{F(X)}^{-1}:F(X)'\to F(X)\to G(X)\to G(X)'.
$$
1. For each category $\mathcal{C}$, the unitor $\iota^{sk}_\mathcal{C}:1_{sk(\mathcal{C})}\Rightarrow sk(1_\mathcal{C})$ is defined by
$$
\iota^{sk}_\mathcal{C}=1_{1_{sk(\mathcal{C})}},
$$
since
$$sk(1_\mathcal{C})=E^{\sim1}_\mathcal{C}\circ1_\mathcal{C}\circ E_\mathcal{C}=E^{\sim1}_\mathcal{C}\circ E_\mathcal{C}=1_{sk(\mathcal{C})}.$$
1. For each pair of composable functors $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$, $G:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{C}$, the associator $\alpha^{sk}_{F,G}:sk(F)\circ sk(G)\Rightarrow sk(F\circ G)$ is defined by
$$
\alpha^{sk}_{F,G}=1_{E^{\sim1}_\mathcal{D}\circ F}\star\epsilon^{sk}_\mathcal{C}\star1_{G\circ E_\mathcal{B}}:E^{\sim1}_\mathcal{D}\circ F\circ E_\mathcal{C}\circ E_\mathcal{C}^{\sim1}\circ G\circ E_\mathcal{B}\Rightarrow E^{\sim1}_\mathcal{D}\circ F\circ G\circ E_\mathcal{B}.
$$

### Skeleton of an Indexed Category

Using the above definition, we can canonically define the skeleton of an indexed category.

Let $\psi:\mathcal{B}^{op}\to\mathfrak{Cat}$ be an indexed category. We define the **indexed skeleton of $\psi$**, denoted

$$
sk(\psi):\mathcal{B}^{op}\to\mathfrak{Cat},
$$

to be the indexed category given by postcomposing $\psi$ with $sk$, so $sk(\psi)=sk\circ\psi.$ That is, for each $I\in\mathcal{B}$ we take a skeleton $sk(\psi(I))$ of the category $\psi(I)$ indexed by $I$ with equivalence $E_I:\psi(I)\simeq sk(\psi(I)):E_I^{\sim1}$, we extend functors using the equivalences at various skeletons, and we extend natural transformations using skeletal isomorphisms in the codomain categories (although $\mathcal{B}^{op}$ has only identity $2$-cells since it's a promoted $1$-category, so the action on $2$-cells is trivial).

### Skeleton of a Fibered Category

Using the above definition and the [[Grothendieck construction]], we can define the skeleton of a fibration using the skeleton of an indexed category.

Let $p:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{B}$ be a fibration. We define the **fibered skeleton of $p$**, denoted 

$$
sk(p):sk^p_\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{B}
$$

to be the Grothendieck completion of the indexed skeleton of the indexing by $p$. That is, $sk(p)$ is the fibration obtained by turning $p$ into an indexed category using the Grothendieck construction, taking the indexed skeleton of this indexed category, then turning the resulting skeletal indexed category back into a fibration (via the Grothendieck construction again). We refer to the total category $sk^p_\mathcal{E}$ in the resulting fibration as the **$p$-skeleton** of $\mathcal{E}$, which is different than $sk_\mathcal{E}$ since we have only skeletalized the fiber categories of our original fibration and not the total category of the original fibration. In general, we will have that 
$$
sk_\mathcal{E}\ncong sk^p_\mathcal{E},
$$
although they are trivially equivalent. As an example of this construction in action, we can pass from the monomorphism fibration on a category with pullbacks to the subobject fibration by taking the fibered skeleton. For details, see the subobject fibration section of [[codomain fibration]].

## Properties

In this section we collect some properties of skeleta in [[set-level foundations]].

### Non-invariance

Of course, two categories can be equivalent even if one is skeletal and the other is not.  Thus, the notion of skeletal category violates the [[principle of equivalence]].  (It doesn't make sense to ask whether a *particular* category, skeletal or not, "violates the principle of equivalence".)

### Skeletons without Choice

Without any choice, we have the following theorems.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Any [[thin category]] (i.e. any [[preordered set]]) has a weak skeleton.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
In this case, we can take the objects of the skeleton of $C$ to be the isomorphism classes of $C$.  If $C$ is thin, then we can define a partial ordering on its set of isomorphism classes, making them into a skeleton of $C$.
=--

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Any two skeletons (in the strong sense) of a category are isomorphic.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, with $sk (\mathcal{C})$ and $sk (\mathcal{C})'$ two skeletons of $\mathcal{C}$, and for each object $Y\in\mathcal{C}$ denote by $X_Y$ and $X_Y'$ respectively the unique objects in $sk (\mathcal{C})$ and $sk (\mathcal{C})'$ which are isomorphic to Y, and denote their respective isomorphisms by $i_Y:Y\to X_Y$ and $i_Y':Y\to X_Y'$. We define a functor $F:sk (\mathcal{C})\to sk (\mathcal{C})'$ by 
$$
F(X_Y)=X_Y',
$$
$$
F(f:X_Y\to X_Z)=i_Z'\circ i_Z^{-1}\circ f\circ i_Y\circ i_Y'^{-1}:X_Y'\to Y\to X_Y\to X_Z\to Z\to X_Z'.
$$
We then have 
$$
F(1_{X_Y})=i_Y'\circ i_Y^{-1}\circ 1_{X_Y}\circ i_Y\circ i_Y'^{-1}=i_Y'\circ i_Y^{-1}\circ i_Y\circ i_Y'^{-1}=i_Y'\circ1_Y\circ i_Y'^{-1}=i_Y'\circ i_Y'^{-1}=1_{X_Y'}=1_{F(X_Y)},
$$
$$
F(f:X_B\to X_C)\circ F(g:X_A\to X_B)=i_C'\circ i_C^{-1}\circ f\circ i_B\circ i_B'^{-1}\circ i_B'\circ i_B^{-1}\circ g\circ i_A\circ i_A'^{-1}
$$
$$
=i_C'\circ i_C^{-1}\circ f\circ i_B\circ 1_{B}\circ i_B^{-1}\circ g\circ i_A\circ i_A'^{-1}=i_C'\circ i_C^{-1}\circ f\circ i_B\circ i_B^{-1}\circ g\circ i_A\circ i_A'^{-1}
$$
$$
=i_C'\circ i_C^{-1}\circ f\circ1_{X_B}\circ g\circ i_A\circ i_A'^{-1}=i_C'\circ i_C^{-1}\circ f\circ g\circ i_A\circ i_A'^{-1}=F(f\circ g),
$$
so $F$ is a functor. The inverse $F^{-1}: sk (\mathcal{C})'\to sk (\mathcal{C})$ is defined in the obvious way, and is functorial by similar computations.
=--

Notice that the [[axiom of choice]] fails in general when one considers [[internal category|internal categories]].  Hence not every [[internal category]] has a skeleton. A necessary condition for an internal category $X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0$ to have a skeleton is the existence quotient $X_0/X_1$ - the object of orbits under the action of the core of $X$. If the quotient map $X_0 \to X_0/X_1$ has a section, then one could consider $X$ to have a skeleton, but this condition isn't sufficient for the induced inclusion functor to be a weak equivalence of internal categories when this makes sense (i.e. if the category is internal to a site).

### Equivalents of Choice

Define a *coskeleton* of a category $C$ to be a skeletal category $S$ with a surjective equivalence $C\to S$.  In [[Categories, Allegories]] it is shown that the following are equivalent.

1. The axiom of choice holds.
1. Any two ana-equivalent categories are strongly equivalent.
   +-- {: .query}
   I removed 'non-ana', since I don\'t think that 'strongly equivalent' would ever be used in an 'ana-' sense.  ---Toby

   Addendum:  Actually, I don\'t know why I asked whether you meant weakly or strongly here, since obviously one can prove that two ana-equivalent categories are weakly equivalent!  It seems that the discussion above used the terms 'equivalence' and 'ana-equivalence' where [[equivalence of categories]] uses 'strong equivalence' and 'weak equivalence' or 'ana-equivalence'; so I just changed it.  And then I added another entry, which maybe you should remove if Freyd & Scedrov don\'t actually address it.  On the other hand, if they really talk about weak equivalence instead of ana-equivalence (although if they define it in elementary terms, it\'s hard to tell the difference), maybe there\'s no need to say 'ana-' at all on this page.
   =--
1. Any two weakly equivalent categories are strongly equivalent.
1. Every small category has a weak skeleton.
1. Every small category has a coskeleton.
1. Any two weak skeletons of a given small category are isomorphic.
1. Any two coskeletons of a given small category are isomorphic.

For convenience we add:

1. Given an inhabited family $\{S_i\}_I$ of equinumerous sets there exists $0 \in I$  and a family of isomorphisms of the permutation groups $\{Aut(S_0) \to Aut(S_i)\}_I$.
1. Given a family $\{S_i\}_I$ of inhabited equinumerous sets, there exists a family $(x_i)_I$ such that $x_i \in S_i$ for all $i \in I$.

### Uniqueness of Constructions

It is well-known that objects defined by [[universal property|universal properties]] in a category, such as [[limits]] and [[colimits]], are not unique on the nose, but only unique up to unique canonical isomorphism.  It can be tempting to suppose that in a *skeletal* category, where any two isomorphic objects are equal, such objects will in fact be unique on the nose.  However, under the most appropriate definition of "unique," this is *not* true (in general), because of the presence of automorphisms.

More explicitly, consider the notion of [[cartesian product]] in a category.  Although we colloquially speak of "a product" of objects $A$ and $B$ as being the *object* $A\times B$, strictly speaking a product consists of the object $A\times B$ *together with* the projections $A\times B\to A$ and $A\times B\to B$ which exhibit its universal property.  Thus, even if the category in question is skeletal, so that there can be only one object $A\times B$ that is a product of $A$ and $B$, in general this object can still "be the product of $A$ and $B$" in many different ways.

For example, given any projections $A\times B\to A$ and $A\times B\to B$ that exhibit $A\times B$ as a product of $A$ and $B$, we can compose them both with any automorphism of $A\times B$ to get a new, different, pair of projections that also exhibit $A\times B$ as a product of $A$ and $B$.  In fact, the universal property of a product implies that any two pairs of projections are related by an automorphism of $A\times B$, so this example is generic.  Thus, even in a skeletal category, we cannot speak of "the" product of $A$ and $B$, except in the same [[generalized the|generalized sense]] that makes sense in any category.  A formal way to say this is that the "category of products of $A$ and $B$," while still *equivalent* to the [[trivial category]], as it is in any category with products, will not be *isomorphic* to the trivial category even when the ambient category is skeletal.

(It is true in a few cases, though, that skeletality implies uniqueness on the nose.  For instance, a [[terminal object]] can have no nonidentity automorphisms, so in a skeletal category, a terminal object (if one exists) really is unique on the nose.)

## In intensional/homotopy type theory

All the discussion above pertains to [[set-level foundations]].  In [[intensional type theory]] such as [[homotopy type theory]], additional care is needed.

A first guess is to define a [[precategory]] $C$ to be skeletal if for any objects $a,b$ there is a function $\Vert a\cong b\Vert \to (a=b)$, i.e. if $a$ and $b$ are merely isomorphic then they are equal.  (Here $\Vert-\Vert$ denotes the [[propositional truncation]].)  However, if the [[type]] $ob(C)$ of objects is not a set, then $a=b$ is not a [[proposition]], and so under this definition a category could "be skeletal" in more than one way.

Arguably a better definition is to say that a precategory $C$ is **skeletal** if for any objects $a,b$ the canonical function
$$ (a=b) \to \Vert a\cong b\Vert $$
is an equivalence.  Since $\Vert a\cong b\Vert$ is always a proposition, this entails that $a=b$ is also a proposition.  Thus, this implies that $ob(C)$ *is* a set, i.e. that $C$ is a [[strict category]].

Note the analogy between this condition and the notion of [[univalent category]]: the only difference is the propositional truncation.  It follows that if a precategory is both skeletal and univalent, then $a\cong b$ is always a proposition (since it is equivalent to its propositional truncation), and thus the category is [[gaunt category|gaunt]].  Indeed, the gaunt categories are precisely those that are both skeletal and univalent.

Unlike in set-level foundations, in intensional type theory not every precategory (and not even every univalent category) has a skeleton.  Indeed, if the axiom [[sets cover]] fails, then there can be univalent categories that are not weakly equivalent to any strict category.  For this reason, the notion of skeleton tends to be less useful outside of set-level foundations, although particular concrete examples may turn out to be skeletal.

## Examples

* Every [[poset]] is skeletal.
 
* The [[walking parallel pair]] is a skeletal category which is not a poset.

* The [[free object|free]] [[category]] on a [[directed acyclic graph]] is skeletal.

All of the above examples are in fact [[gaunt categories|gaunt]]: not only are any two isomorphic objects equal, but any isomorphism is an identity morphism.

* The [[delooping]] of a [[group]] is a skeletal category that is not gaunt (unless the group is [[trivial group|trivial]]).  In intensional type theory, this is a non-univalent precategory; its [[Rezk completion]] is no longer skeletal according to the above improved definition.

### Posets as skeleta of prosets
 {#PosetsAsSkeletaOfProsets}

In terms of [[(n,r)-category]]-theory one may essentially identify [[preordered sets]] with *[[thin categories]]* or *[[(0,1)-categories]]*. Under this identification, the passage of skeleta of categories corresponds to choosing an [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] [[partial order]] inside a [[preorder]]. 

For more details (and more precise statements, see at *[[relation between preorders and (0,1)-categories]]*.

## Idea

The **fundamental groupoid** of a space $X$ is a [[groupoid]] whose objects are the points of $X$ and whose morphisms are [[paths]] in $X$, identified up to endpoint-preserving [[homotopy]].

In parts of the literature the fundamental groupoid, and more generally the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]], is called the **Poincar&#233; groupoid**.


## Definition

The **fundamental groupoid** $\Pi_1(X)$ of a topological space $X$ is the [[groupoid]] whose set of objects is $X$ and whose morphisms from $x$ to $y$ are the equivalence classes of homotopy of homotopy relative to $\partial I$ $[\gamma]$ of continuous maps $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ whose endpoints map to $x$ and $y$ (which the homotopies are required to fix). Composition is by concatenation (and reparametrization) of representative maps. Under the [[homotopy]]-[[equivalence relation]] this becomes an associative and unital composition with respect to which every morphism has an inverse; hence $\Pi_1(X)$ is a groupoid.

The use of the fundamental groupoid of a manifold for describing the monodromy principle on the extension of local morphisms is discussed in the paper by Brown/Mucuk listed below. 


## Remarks

### Relationship to fundamental group

For any $x$ in $X$ the first homotopy group $\pi_1(X,x)$ of $X$ based at $x$ arises as the [[automorphism group]] of $x$ in $\Pi_1(X)$:
$$
  \pi_1(X,x) = Aut_{\Pi_1(X)}(x)
  \,.
$$
So the fundamental groupoid gets rid of the choice of basepoint for the fundamental group, and this is valuable for some applications. The set of connected components of $\Pi_1(X)$ is precisely the set $\Pi_0(X)$ of path-components of $X$.  (This is not to be confused with the set of connected components of $X$, sometimes denoted by the same symbol.  Of course they are the same when $X$ is locally path-connected.)


### Topologizing the fundamental groupoid

The fundamental groupoid $\Pi_1(X)$ can be made into a [[topological groupoid]] (i.e. a [[internal groupoid|groupoid internal]] to [[Top]]) when $X$ is [[path-connected space|path-connected]], [[locally path-connected space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply connected space|semi-locally simply connected]]. This is a special case of ([Brown 06, 10.5.8](#Browno6)). 
This construction is closely linked with the construction of a [[universal covering space]] for a path-connected pointed space. The object space of this groupoid is just the space $X$.


When $X$ is not semi-locally simply connected, the set of arrows of the fundamental groupoid inherits the [[quotient space|quotient topology]] from the path space such that the fibres of $(s,t):Mor(\Pi_1(X)) \to X\times X$ are not discrete, which is an obstruction to the above-mentioned source fibre\'s being a covering space. However the composition is no longer continuous. When $X$ is not locally path-connected, $\Pi_0(X)$ also inherits a non-discrete topology (the quotient topology of $X$ by the relation of path connections).

In circumstances like these more sophisticated methods are appropriate, such as [[shape theory]].  This is also related to the [[fundamental group of a topos]], which is in general a [[progroup]] or a [[localic group]] rather than an ordinary group.


### $\Pi_1(X)$ with a chosen set of basepoints

An improvement on the fundamental group and the total fundamental groupoid  relevant to the [[van Kampen theorem]] for computing the fundamental group or groupoid is to use $\Pi_1(X,A)$, defined for a set $A$ to be the full subgroupoid of $\Pi_1(X)$ on the set $A\cap X$, thus giving a set  of base points which can be  chosen according to the geometry at hand. Thus if $X$ is the union of two open sets $U,V$ with intersection $W$ then we can take $A$ large enough to meet each path-component of $U,V,W$; note that by the above definition we can write $\Pi_1(U,A)$, etc.  If $X$ has an action of a group $G$ then $G$ acts on $\Pi_1(X,A)$ if $A$ is a union of orbits of the action. Thus $\Pi_1(X,A)$ can represent some symmetry of a given situation. 

 The notion of $\Pi_1(X,A)$ was introduced in 1967 by [[Ronnie Brown]]  to give a version of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem which allowed the determination  of the fundamental group of a connected space which is the union of connected subspaces with nonconnected intersection, such as the  circle, a space  which is, after all, THE basic example in topology.

Grothendieck writes in his 1984 [[Esquisse d'un Programme]] (English translation):

" ..,people still obstinately persist,  when calculating with fundamental groups, in fixing a single base point, instead of cleverly choosing a whole packet of points which is invariant under  the symmetries of the situation, which thus get lost on the way.  In certain situations (such as descent theorems for fundamental groups \`a la van  Kampen) it is much more elegant,  even indispensable for understanding  something, to work with fundamental groupoids with respect to a suitable    packet of base points,..". 

Notice that $\Pi_1(X,X)$ recovers the full fundamental groupoid, while $\Pi_1(X,\{x\})$ is simply  the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x)$. 

 Basically, $\Pi_1(X,A)$  allows for the _computation of homotopy 1-types_; the theory was developed in  _Elements of Modern Topology_ (1968), now available as _Topology and Groupoids_ (2006). These accounts show  the use of the algebra of  groupoids in 1-dimensional   [[homotopy theory]], for example for [[covering space]]s,  and, in the later edition,  for [[orbit space]]s. Another text in English which covers this notion is  by Philip Higgins, see below.

## Idea

Given a sequence 

$$
  X_\bullet
  =
  \left(
  X_0 
   \overset{f_0}{\longrightarrow}
  X_1
   \overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}
  X_2
   \overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}
  \cdots
  \right)
$$

of ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[topological spaces]], then its _mapping telescope_ is the result of forming the (reduced) [[mapping cylinder]] $Cyl(f_n)$ for each $n$ and then attaching all these cylinders to each other in the canonical way.


At least if all the $f_n$ are inclusions, this is the sequential attachment of ever "larger" cylinders, whence the name "telescope".

The mapping telescope is a representation for the [[homotopy colimit]] over $X_\bullet$. It is used for instance for discussion of [[lim^1 and Milnor sequences]] (and that's maybe the origin of the concept?).

a sequence  in [[Top]], its **mapping telescope** is the [[quotient topological space]] of the [[disjoint union]] of [[product topological spaces]]

$$

## Properties

### For CW-complexes

+-- {: .num_prop #TelescopeOfCWComplexEquivalentToTheOriginal}
###### Proposition

For $X_\bullet$ the sequence of stages of a ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[CW-complex]] $X = \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n X_n$, then the canonical map

$$
  Tel(X_\bullet)
  \longrightarrow
  X
$$

from the [[mapping telescope]], def. \ref{MappingTelescope}, is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write in the following $Tel(X)$ for $Tel(X_\bullet)$ and write $Tel(X_n)$ for the mapping telescop of the substages of the finite stage $X_n$ of $X$. It is intuitively clear that each of the projections at finite stage

$$
  Tel(X_n) \longrightarrow X_n
$$

is a [[homotopy equivalence]], hence a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. A concrete construction of a homotopy inverse is given for instance in ([Switzer 75, proof of prop. 7.53](#Switzer75)).

Moreover, since spheres are [[compact object|compact]], so that elements of [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_q(Tel(X))$ are represented at some finite stage $\pi_q(Tel(X_n))$ it follows that 

$$
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n \pi_q(Tel(X_n)) 
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  \pi_q(Tel(X))
$$

are [[isomorphisms]] for all $q\in \mathbb{N}$ and all choices of basepoints (not shown). 

Together these two facts imply that in the following commuting square, three morphisms are isomorphisms, as shown.

$$
  \array{
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \pi_q(Tel(X_n))
    &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_q(Tel(X))
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \pi_q(X_n)
    &\underset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_q(X)    
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore also the remaining morphism is an isomorphism ([[two-out-of-three]]). Since this holds for all $q$ and all basepoints, it is a weak homotopy equivalence.

## Definition

A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __symmetric__ if any two elements that are related in one order are also related in the other order:
$$\forall (x, y: A),\; x \sim y \;\Rightarrow\; y \sim x$$

In the language of the $2$-poset-with-duals [[Rel]] of sets and relations, a relation $R: A \to A$ is __symmetric__ if it is contained in its reverse:
$$R \subseteq R^{op}$$
In that case, this containment is in fact an equality.

## Relation to graphs

A set with a symmetric relation is the same as a [[loop digraph object|loop]] [[digraph]] $(V, E, s:E \to V, t:E \to V)$ with a function $sym:E \to E$ such that 

* for every $f \in E$, $s(f) =_V t(sym(f))$
* for every $f \in E$, $t(f) =_V s(sym(f))$
* for every $f \in E$, $sym(sym(f)) =_E f$

## Definitions

A [[concrete point|point]] $P$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is __isolated__ if it is a [[neighbourhood]] of itself, in other words if the [[singleton subset]] $\{P\}$ is [[open subset|open]].

More generally, a point $P$ of a [[subset]] $A$ of a space $X$ is __isolated__ in $A$ if it is isolated when viewed as a point in the [[subspace]] $A$ with the [[subspace topology]].  More explicitly, for some [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $P$ (in $X$), $U \cap A = \{P\}$.

The antithetical concept is that of an [[accumulation point]].

## Definition

Given a [[topological space]] (or [[locale]]) $X$, a [[subspace]] $A$ of $X$ is __dense__ if its [[closed subspace|closure]] is all of $X$: $cl(A)=X$.

Since $cl(A)$ is the set of all points $x$ such that every [[open neighborhood]] of $x$ [[intersection|intersects]] $A$, this can equivalently be written as "every open neighborhood of every point intersects $A$", or equivalently "every [[inhabited set|inhabited]] open set intersects $A$", i.e. $A\cap U$ is [[inhabited]] for all inhabited open sets $U$.

Contraposing this, we obtain another equivalent definition "the only open subset not intersecting $A$ is the empty set", or "if $A\cap U=\emptyset$ for some open set $U$, then $U=\emptyset$".  This is the definition usually given when $X$ is a [[locale]]: a [[nucleus]] $j$ is dense if $j(0)=0$ (since $j(0)$ is the union of all opens whose "intersection with $j$" is $0$).


## Properties

* If $A \subseteq X$ is a dense subset of a topological space $X$ and $f: X \to Y$ is an [[epimorphism]], then the [[image]] $f(A)$ is dense in $Y$. 

* If i: $A \hookrightarrow X$ and $j: X \hookrightarrow B$ are dense subspace inclusions, then so is the composite $j \circ i: A \to B$. 

* If $A\subseteq X$ is a dense subset of topological space $X$ and $A$ is [[connected topological space|connected]], so is $X$.

* In point-set topology, a space is [[separable space|separable]] if and only if it has a dense subspace with [[countable set|countably]] many points.

* In [[locale]] theory, we have the curious property that any [[intersection]] of dense subspaces is still dense.  (This of course fails rather badly for [[topological spaces]], where the intersection of all dense topological subspaces is the space of [[isolated point]]s.)  One consequence is that every locale has a smallest dense sublocale, the [[double negation sublocale]].

\begin{proposition}

In the [[category]] of [[Hausdorff topological spaces]] (with [[continuous functions]] between them), the inclusion of a [[dense subspace]] 

$$
  A \overset{\;\;i\;\;}{\hookrightarrow} X
$$ 

is an [[epimorphism]].

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

We have to show that for $(f,g)$ any [[pair]] of [[parallel morphisms]] out of $X$

$$
  A 
  \overset{\;\;i\;\;}{\hookrightarrow}
  X 
  \underoverset
  {\;\;g\;\;}
  {\;\;f\;\;}
  {\rightrightarrows}
  Y
$$

into a [[Hausdorff space]] $Y$, the [[equality]] $f \circ i = g \circ i$ implies $f = g$. With [[classical logic]] we may equivalently show the [[contrapositive]]: That $f \neq g$ implies $f \circ i \neq  g \circ i$.

So assume that $f \neq g$. This means that there exists $y \in Y$ with $f(y) \neq g(y)$. But since $Y$ is Hausdorff, there exist [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[open neighbourhoods]] $O_{f(y)},\;O_{g(y)} \subset Y$, i.e. $f(x) \in O_{f(x)}$ and $g(x) \in O_{g(x)}$ with $O_{f(x)} \cap O_{g(x)} = \varnothing$.

But their [[preimages]] must intersect at least in $x \in f^{-1}\big( O_{f(x)} \big) \cap g^{-1}\big(  O_{g(x)} \big)$. Since this intersection is an [[open subset]] (as preimages of open subsets are open by definition of [[continuous functions]], and since finite [[intersections]] of open subsets are open by the definition of [[topological spaces]]) there exists a point $a \in A$ with $i(a) \in f^{-1}\big( O_{f(x)} \big) \cap g^{-1}\big(  O_{g(x)} \big)$ (by definition of [[dense subset]]). But since then $f(i(a)) \in O_{f(x)}$ and $g(i(a)) \in O_{g(x)}$ while $O_{f(x)}$ is [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] from $O_{g(x)}$, it follows that $f(i(a)) \neq g(i(a))$. This means that $f \circ i \neq g \circ i$. 

\end{proof}


## In constructive mathematics

In [[constructive mathematics]], the law of contraposition is not an equivalence, so we obtain two inequivalent notions of density:

* $A\subseteq X$ is **strongly dense** if $A\cap U$ is inhabited for all inhabited open sets $U\subseteq X$.
* $A\subseteq X$ is **weakly dense** if $A\cap U = \emptyset$ for some open $U\subseteq X$ implies $U=\emptyset$.

Of course, strong density implies weak density, since emptiness is non-inhabitation (whereas inhabitation is stronger than non-emptiness).  The two notions of density are related dually to the corresponding notions of [[closed subspace]]: $A$ is strongly dense iff its weak closure is all of $X$, and weakly dense iff its strong closure is all of $X$.

Note that the usual notion of density for [[sublocales]] $j(0)=0$ is an analogue of *weak* density, and could be called such.  There is also a notion of *strong* density for sublocales.  Since strong density refers to inhabited sets, one might expect strong density for sublocales to refer to [[positive elements]], and thus only be sensible for [[overt locales]]; but in fact it can be reformulated to make sense in all cases.

With classical logic, every truth value is either $\top$ or $\bot$, and we have $\hat{\top}=X$ (and any nucleus satisfies $j(X)=X$) while $\hat{\bot}=0$.  Thus classically strong and weak density coincide.  To see that this is really a notion of strong density, we prove:

+--{: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
If $i:A\subseteq X$ is a sublocale such that $A$ and $X$ are both [[overt]], then $A$ is strongly dense if and only if for any positive open $U\in O(X)$, the intersection $A\cap U = i^*U \in O(A)$ is also positive.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
First suppose $A$ is strongly dense, and let $U\in O(X)$ be positive.  Let $P$ be the truth value of the statement "$i^*U \in O(A)$ is positive".  We want to show that $P$ is true, for which it suffices to show that $\hat{P} = \bigvee \{ X \mid P \}$ is positive, since then its covering $\{ X \mid P \}$ would be inhabited and thus $P$ would be true.  And since $U$ is positive, it suffices to show $U \subseteq \hat{P}$.

Now since $A$ is strongly dense, $j_A(\hat{P}) = \hat{P}$, which is to say that $\hat{P} = i_*(i^*\hat{P})$.  By adjointness, therefore, to show $U \subseteq \hat{P}$ it suffices to show $i^*U \subseteq i^*\hat{P} = \bigvee \{ A \mid P\}$.  Now since $A$ is overt, $i^*U$ can be covered by positive opens, so it suffices to show that for any positive $V\subseteq i^*U$ we have $V\subseteq \bigvee \{ A \mid P\}$.  But if $V\subseteq i^*U$ is positive, then $i^*U$ is also positive, i.e. $P$ is true, and thus $\bigvee \{ A \mid P\} = A$, which contains $V$.

Now suppose conversely that for any positive $U\in O(X)$, $i^*U$ is also positive, and let $P$ be any truth value; we must show $i_* i^*\hat{P} \subseteq \hat{P}$.  Since $X$ is overt, $i_* i^*\hat{P}$ can be covered by positive opens, so it suffices to show that for any positive $U\subseteq i_* i^*\hat{P}$ we have $U\subseteq \hat{P}$.  But by adjointness, $U\subseteq i_* i^*\hat{P}$ is equivalent to $i^*U \subseteq i^*\hat{P}$, and by assumption $i^*U$ is also positive.  Thus, $i^*\hat{P} = \bigvee \{ A \mid P\}$ is positive, which means that $P$ is true, and hence $\hat{P} = X$ and so $U\subseteq \hat{P}$.
=--

Since spatial locales are overt, and their positivity predicate coincides with inhabitedness, we have in particular:

+--{: .un_cor}
###### Corollary
If $i:A\subseteq X$ is a subspace of a topological space, then $A$ is strongly dense as a topological subspace if and only if it is strongly dense as a sublocale.
=--

Strong density for sublocales gives rise to a corresponding notion of [[weakly closed sublocale]].  It is also the specialization of the notion of [[fiberwise dense sublocale]] to the case of locale maps $X\to 1$.

## Definition

A priori a __locally compact topological group__ is a [[topological group]] $G$ whose underlying [[topological space]] is [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]]. 

Typically it is also assumed that $G$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. (Notice that if not, then $G/\overline{\{1\}}$ is Hausdorff.). 

One often says just "locally compact group".

## Properties

### In harmonic analysis

We take here locally compact groups $G$ to be also Hausdorff. 

Locally compact topological groups are the standard object of study in classical abstract [[harmonic analysis]]. The crucial properties of locally compact groups is that they posses a left (right) [[Haar measure]] $\rho$ and that $L^1(\rho)$ has a structure of a 
[[Banach algebra|Banach]] $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]]. 

A left (right) [[Haar measure]] on a locally compact topological group is a nonzero [[Radon measure]] which is invariant under the left (right) multiplications by elements in the group. A topological subgroup $H$ of a locally compact topological group $G$ is itself locally compact (in [[induced topology]]) iff it is closed in $G$. 

### Completeness 

Again taking locally compact groups $G$ to be Hausdorff, such are [[complete space|complete]] both with respect to their left [[uniform space|uniformity]] and their right uniformity. For if $\{x_\alpha\}$ is a [[Cauchy net]] in $G$ and $U$ is a compact neighborhood of the identity $e$, then there is $\alpha$ so large that $x_\beta x_\alpha^{-1} \in U$ for all $\beta \geq \alpha$. Those elements converge to a point $x \in U$ since $U$ is compact, and the original net converges to $x \cdot x_\alpha$. A similar argument is used for the right uniformity.

## Definition

A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __reflexive__ if every element of $A$ is related to itself:
$$\forall (x: A),\; x \sim x$$

In the language of the $2$-poset [[Rel]] of sets and relations, a relation $R: A \to A$ is __reflexive__ if it contains the identity relation on $A$:
$$\id_A \subseteq R$$

## Relation to graphs

A set with a reflexive relation is the same as a [[loop digraph object|loop]] [[digraph]] $(V, E, s:E \to V, t:E \to V)$ with function $refl:V \to E$ such that 

* for every $a \in V$, $s(refl(a)) =_E a$
* for every $a \in V$, $t(refl(a)) =_E a$

## Of chain complexes

### Idea 

Under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], [[∞-groupoids]] with strict abelian group structure (modeled by [[Kan complexes]] that are [[simplicial object|simplicial]] abelian groups) are identified with non-negatively graded [[chain complexes]] of abelian groups

$$
  N_\bullet : SimpAb \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Ch_+
  \,.
$$

The **homology groups** of a [[chain complex]] of abelian groups are the image under this identification of the [[homotopy groups]] of the corresponding [[∞-groupoids]]. More details on this are at [[chain homology and cohomology]].


So at least for the case of chain complexes of abelian groups we have the slogan

+-- {: .standout}

**homology** = [[homotopy]] under [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

=--

Of course historically the development of concepts was precisely the opposite: chain homology is an old fundamental concept in [[homological algebra]] that is simpler to deal with than [[simplicial homotopy groups]]. The computational simplification for chain complexes is what makes the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] useful after all.

Conceptually, however, it can be useful to understand homology as a special kind of [[homotopy]]. This is maybe most vivid in the [[duality|dual]] picture: [[cohomology]] derives its name from that fact that [[chain homology and cohomology]] are dual concepts. But later generalizations of [[cohomology]] to [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] and further to [[nonabelian cohomology]] showed that the restricted notion of homology is an insufficient dual model for cohomology: what cohomology is really dual to is the more general concept of [[homotopy]].  More on this is at [[cohomotopy]] and [[Eckmann-Hilton duality]].


### Definition

The category of abelian groups is in particular an [[abelian category]].
We can define [[chain complexes]] and their homology in any [[abelian category]] $C$. 

Let $C$ be an [[abelian category]] and let
$$
  V_\bullet = ( \cdots  \to V_{n+1} \stackrel{\delta_n}{\to}
  V_n \stackrel{\delta_{n-1}}{\to}
  V_{n-1} \to \cdots
  )
$$
be a [[chain complex]] in $C$. For each integer $n \in \mathbb{N}$ this induces the following diagram of [[kernel]]s, [[cokernel]]s and [[image]]s

$$
  \array{
    && im \delta_n &&\to&& ker \delta_{n-1}
    \\
    & \nearrow && \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    V_{n+1}
    &&\stackrel{\delta_n}{\to}&&
    V_n
    &&\stackrel{\delta_{n-1}}{\to}&&
    V_{n-1}
    \\
    & &&
    \swarrow && \searrow && \nearrow
    \\
    && coker \delta_n &&\stackrel{}{\to}&&
    im \delta_{n-1}
  }
$$

the **homology** $H_n(V)$ of $V$ in degree $n$ is the object

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    im(ker \delta_{n-1} \to  V_n \to coker \delta_{n}) 
    & \simeq
    coker(im \delta_n \to ker \delta_{n-1})
    \\
    & \simeq
    coker(V_{n+1} \to ker \delta_{n-1})
    \\
    & \simeq
    ker(coker \delta_n \to im \delta_{n-1})
    \\
    & \simeq
    ker(coker \delta_n \to V_{n-1})
  \end{aligned}
$$


* If $H_n(V) \simeq 0$ then one says that the complex $V$ is [[exact sequence|exact]] in degree $n$.

### Examples 

In the special case that $C$ is the category of abelian groups, or of vector spaces, this definition reduces to the more familiar simpler statement:

the $n$-th homology group of the [[chain complex]] $V_\bullet$ is the quotient group

$$
  H_n(V) = ker(\partial_n) / im(\partial_{n+1})
  \,.
$$

## Generalized homology

By the [[Brown representability theorem]] every [[spectrum]] $A$ induces a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory, and dually a **generalized homology theory**.

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $A$ a [[spectrum]], the generalized homology of spectrum of $X$ with coefficients in $A$ is 

$$
  X \wedge A := \Sigma^\infty(X)\wedge A
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[smash product of spectra]] with the [[suspension spectrum]] of $X$ and on the left we abbreviate this to the [[(∞,1)-colimit|(∞,1)-tensoring]] of [[Spec]] over [[Top]].

The corresponding [[homology group]]s are the [[homotopy group]]s of this spectrum:

$$
  E_n(X,A) := \pi_n(X \wedge A) := [\Sigma^n \mathbb{S}, X \wedge A ]
  \,.
$$

where $\mathbb{S}$ is the [[sphere spectrum]]. For more see [[generalized homology]].

## Definition

An _orthogonal matrix_ is a [[square matrix]] $A$ whose [[transpose matrix]]  equals its [[inverse matrix]] $A^T = A^{-1}$, hence such that $A^T A = 1$ under [[matrix multiplication]].
 
Orthogonal matrices form a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]], namely the [[orthogonal group]].

For a generalization see _[[J-orthogonal matrix]]_. 

## Properties

Every real matrix $A$ can be factorized $A = Q R$ where $Q$ is orthogonal and $R$ is   a (say, upper) triangular matrix (wikipedia/[QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) which is a special case of [[Iwasawa decomposition]] for semisimple Lie groups). This is consequence of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. Similarly, every complex matrix can be factorized into a unitary and a complex upper triangular (complex) matrix.

Over the reals, the [[Cayley transform]] is a [[diffeomorphism]] between the linear space skewsymmetric matrices and an open subset of the Lie group of orthogonal matrices ($A$ such that $I+A$ is invertible) - a chart which is often having an advantage over using the exponential map.

## Idea

A _free module_ over some [[ring]] $R$ is [[free construction|freely generated]] on a [[set]] of [[basis]] elements.

Under the [interpretation of modules as generalized vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction) a _free module_ corresponds to a _trivial_ bundle.

## Definition

### General

Let $C$ be a [[monoidal category]], and $Alg(C)$ the [[category of monoids]] in $C$; and for $A \in Alg(C)$ let $A$[[Mod]]$(C)$ be the category of $A$-[[modules]] in $C$.

There is the evident [[forgetful functor]] $U : A Mod(C) \to C$ that sends each module $(N,\rho)$ to its underlying object $N \in C$. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The [[left adjoint]] $C \to A Mod(C)$ is the corresponding [[free construction]]. The modules in the image of this functor are _free modules_.

=-- 

### Over rings

Let $R$ be a ring. We discuss free [[modules]] over $R$.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $R \in $ [[Ring]] a [[ring]] and $S \in $ [[Set]], the free $R$-module on $S$ is isomorphic to the ${\vert S\vert}$-fold [[direct sum]] of $R$ with itself

$$
  R^{(S)}\simeq \oplus_{s \in S} R
  \,.
$$

=--

## Properties

### As a monoidal functor

Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $R\{X\}$ denote the free $R$-module on a set $X$.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The free $R$-module functor is strong monoidal with respect to the Cartesian monoidal structure on sets, and the tensor product of $R$-modules.

=--

In other words, the free module construction turns set-theoretic products into tensor products. Thus, it preserves algebraic objects (such as [[monoid object]]s, [[Hopf monoid]] objects, etc.) and their homomorphisms. In particular, if $M$ is a monoid in the category of sets (and hence a bimonoid with the canonical comonoid structure) then $R\{M\}$ is a bimonoid object in $R \mathsf{Mod}$, which is precisely a $K$-bialgebra. A group $G$ in the category of sets is a Hopf monoid, and hence $R\{G\}$ is a Hopf algebra --- this is precisely the [[group algebra]] of $G$.


### Submodules of free modules
 {#SubmodulesOfFreeModules}

Let $R$ be a commutative [[ring]].

+-- {: .num_prop #submod}
###### Proposition

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the following are equivalent

1. every [[submodule]] of a free $R$-module is itself free;

1. every [[ideal]] in $R$ is a free $R$-module;

1. $R$ is a [[principal ideal domain]].

=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
(See also [Rotman, pages 650-651](#Rotman).) Condition 1. immediately implies condition 2., since ideals of $R$ are the same as submodules of $R$ seen as an $R$-module. Now assume condition 2. holds, and suppose $x \in R$ is any nonzero element. Let $\lambda_x$ denote multiplication by $x$ (as an $R$-module map). We have a sequence of surjective $R$-module maps 

$$R \stackrel{\lambda_x}{\to} (x) \cong \oplus_J R \stackrel{\nabla}{\to} R$$ 

(where $\nabla$ is the [[codiagonal]] map); by the [[Yoneda lemma]], the composite map $R \to R$ is of the form $\lambda_r$, where $r \in R$ is the value of the composite at $1 \in R$. Since $\lambda_r$ is surjective, we have $\lambda_r(s) = r s = 1$ for some $s$, so that $r$ is invertible. Hence $\lambda_r$ is invertible, and this implies $\lambda_x$ is monic. Therefore $R$ is a domain. From that, we infer that if $f$ and $g$ belong to a basis of an ideal $I$, then 

$$0 \neq f g \in R\cdot f \cap R \cdot g$$ 

whence $f$ and $g$ are not linearly independent, so $f = g$ and $I$ as an $R$-module is generated by a single element, i.e., $R$ is a principal ideal domain. 

That condition 3. implies condition 1. is proved [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/principal+ideal+domain#free). 
=--


+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], over a ring $R$ which is a [[principal ideal domain]], every [[module]] has a [[projective resolution]] of length 1.

### Over a field: vector spaces

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], if $R = k$ is a [[field]] then every $R$-[[module]] is free: it is $k$-[[vector space]] and by the _[[basis theorem]]_ every such has a [[basis of a vector space|basis]].

## Idea

A **pushout** is an ubiquitous construction in [[category theory]] providing a [[colimit]] for the diagram $\bullet\leftarrow\bullet\rightarrow\bullet$. It is dual to the notion of a [[pullback]].

## Pushouts in $Set$

In the category [[Set]] a 'pushout' is a quotient of the disjoint union of two sets.  Given a diagram of sets and functions like this:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
      & C \ar[ld, "f"'] \ar[rd, "g"] \\
    A &   & B
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

the 'pushout' of this diagram is the set $X$ obtained by taking the disjoint union $A + B$ and identifying $a \in A$ with $b \in B$ if there exists $x \in C$ such that $f(x) = a$ and $g(x) = b$ (and all identifications that follow to keep [[equality]] an [[equivalence relation]]).

This construction comes up, for example, when $C$ is the intersection of the sets $A$ and $B$, and $f$ and $g$ are the obvious inclusions.  Then the pushout is just the union of $A$ and $B$.

Note that there are maps $i_A : A \to X$, $i_B : B \to X$ such that $i_A(a) = [a]$ and $i_B(b) = [b]$ respectively.  These maps make this square commute:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
                      & C \ar[ld, "f"'] \ar[rd, "g"] \\
    A \ar[rd, "i_A"'] &   & B \ar[ld, "i_B"] \\
                      & X
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

In fact, the pushout is the [[universal property|universal]] solution to finding a [[commutative square]] like this.  In other words, given _any_ commutative square 

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
                             & C \arrow[ld, "f"'] \arrow[rd, "g"] &                     \\
        A \arrow[rd, "j_A"'] &                                    & B \arrow[ld, "j_B"] \\
                             & Y                                  &                    
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

there is a unique function $h: X \to Y$ such that 
$$ h i_A = j_A $$
and
$$ h i_B = j_B .$$
Since this universal property expresses the concept of pushout purely arrow-theoretically, we can formulate it in any category.  It is, in fact, a simple special case of a [[colimit]].  


## Definition

A **pushout** is a [[colimit]] of a [[diagram]] like this:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
          & c \arrow[ld, "f"'] \arrow[rd, "g"] &   \\
        a &                                    & b
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Such a diagram is called a [[span]].  If the colimit exists, we obtain a [[commutative square]]

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
                             & c \arrow[ld, "f"'] \arrow[rd, "g"] &                     \\
        a \arrow[rd, "i_a"'] &                                    & b \arrow[ld, "i_b"] \\
                             & \chi                               &                    
    \end{tikzcd}

and the object $x$ is also called the **pushout**.  It has the universal property already described above in the special case of the category $Set$.

Other terms: $x$ is a __cofibred coproduct__ of $a$ and $b$, or (especially in [[algebraic categories]] when $f$ and $g$ are [[monomorphisms]]) a free product of $a$ and $b$ with $c$ __amalgamated__, or more simply an __amalgamation__ (or __amalgam__) of $a$ and $b$.

The concept of pushout is a special case of the notion of **[[cofiber coproduct|wide pushout]]** (compare [[wide pullback]]), where one takes the colimit of a diagram which consists of a set of arrows $\{f_i: c \to a_i\}_{i \in I}$. Thus an ordinary pushout is the case where $I$ has cardinality $2$. 

Note that the concept of pushout is dual to the concept of [[pullback]]: that is, a pushout in $C$ is the same as a pullback in $C^{op}$.

See [[pullback]] for more details.

## Idea

A [[space]] (such as a [[topological space]]) is _second-countable_ if, in a certain sense, there is only a [[countable set|countable]] amount of information globally in its topology.  (Change 'globally' to 'locally' to get a [[first-countable space]].)


## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn #SecondContablTopologicalSpace}
###### Definition
**(second-countable topological space)**

A [[topological space]] is __second-countable__ if it has a [[base for a topology|base for its topology]] consisting of a [[countable set]] of [[subsets]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[locale]] is __second-countable__ if there is a [[countable set]] $B$ of [[open subspaces]] (elements of the [[frame of opens]]) such that every open $G$ is a [[join]] of some [[subset]] of $B$.  That is, we have
$$ G = \bigvee \{ U\colon B \;|\; U \subseteq G \} .$$
=--


## Generalisations

The __weight__ of a space is the [[minimum]] of the [[cardinalities]] of the possible bases $B$.  We are implicitly using the [[axiom of choice]] here, to suppose that this set of cardinalities (which really is a [[small set]] because bounded above by the number of open subspaces, and [[inhabited set|inhabited]] by this number as well) has a minimum.  But without Choice, we can still consider this collection of cardinalities.

Then a second-countable space is simply one with a countable weight.

## Definition

### Standard definition

A **simple group** is a [[group]] $G$ with exactly two [[quotient group]]s: the [[trivial quotient group]] $\{1\} \cong G/G$ and the group $G \cong G/\{1\}$ itself. 

Equivalently, a simple group is a group possessing exactly two [[normal subgroup|normal subgroups]]: the [[trivial subgroup]] $\{1\}$ and the group $G$ itself. One can also say that a normal subgroup is trivial iff it is not $G$, or trivial iff proper (compare the definition in constructive mathematics below).

Note that the [[trivial group]] does not itself count as simple, on the grounds that it has only *one* quotient group (or only one normal subgroup).  It may be possible to find authors that use "at most" in place of "exactly", thereby allowing the trivial group to be simple.  (Compare [[too simple to be simple]].)


### In constructive algebra

In [[constructive mathematics]], we consider a group $G$ equipped with a [[tight apartness]] $\ne$ such that the group operations are [[strongly extensional function|strongly extensional]] and use the theory of [[antisubgroups]] (which classically are the complements of subgroups).  Then $G$ is __simple__ if, given any [[normal antisubgroup]] $N$ of $G$, $N$ is trivial iff it is proper.  Explicitly, this says $N$ owns every nonidentity element (every $x$ such that $x \ne 1$) iff $N$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]] (with some $x$ such that necessarily $x \ne 1$).  Replacing 'iff' with 'if' here would allow the trival group to be simple.


## Examples

### Finite simple groups

Simple groups are most commonly encountered in the theory of [[finite group]]s. Every finite group $G$ admits a [[composition series]], i.e., a finite filtration of subgroups 

$$1 = G_0 \subseteq G_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq G_n = G$$ 

where each inclusion $G_i \subseteq G_{i+1}$ is a [[normal subgroup]] and the quotient $G_{i+1}/G_i$ (called a **composition factor**) is simple. The condition of simplicity means that that the filtration cannot be further refined by addition of strict inclusions of normal subgroups. Furthermore, the [[Jordan-Hölder theorem]] ensures that any two composition series have the same length and the same composition factors (up to permutation). 

Thus finite simple groups are in some sense the primitive building blocks of finite groups generally. The massive program of classifying all finite simple groups was announced as completed by Daniel Gorenstein in 1983, although some doubts remained because there were some gaps in proofs. Most if not all the gaps are considered by experts in the area to have been filled, but there remain some notable skeptics, including for example [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], who said in an interview 

> Whenever I asked the specialists, they replied something like: "Oh no, 
  it is not a gap; it is just something which has not been written, but 
  there is an incomplete unpublished 800-page manuscript on it."  For me, 
  it was just the same as a "gap," and I could not understand why it was 
  not acknowledged as such. ([Source](https://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2008-November/013181.html))

and possibly also [[John H. Conway]], although according to [Joe Shipman](https://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2008-November/013178.html), 

> A few months ago I was discussing the COFSG with John Conway and he was still pessimistic. (Meaning of course that he was confident the classification was correct, "optimistic" in his case means there are previously undiscovered finite simple groups, because they're beautiful and interesting objects and it would be disappointing to have no more.)

See [[classification of finite simple groups]]. 


### Directed colimits 

+-- {: .num_prop #directed} 
###### Proposition 
Let $S_\alpha$ be a directed system of simple groups and monomorphisms between them. Then $colim_\alpha S_\alpha$ is also simple. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Suppose $N$ is a normal subgroup of $colim_\alpha S_\alpha$ with a non-identity element. Then $N_\alpha = N \cap S_\alpha$ is normal in $S_\alpha$ (if $x \in S_\alpha$ and $y \in N \cap S_\alpha$, then clearly $x y x^{-1}$ belongs to both $N$ and $S_\alpha$). As soon as $\alpha$ is large enough that $S_\alpha$ contains a non-identity element of $N$, it follows from simplicity of $S_\alpha$ that $N_\alpha = S_\alpha$. By directedness, this shows $N_\alpha = S_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$, and since for any $s \in S$ there is $\alpha$ such that $s \in S_\alpha$, we conclude $s \in S_\alpha = N_\alpha \subseteq N$, i.e., $N$ contains any $s \in S$. 
=-- 

### Infinite simple groups

There are simple groups of any infinite [[cardinality]] $\kappa$; take for example the smallest normal subgroup of the [[automorphism group]] $Aut(\kappa)$ containing all 3-cycles (this is the infinite version of the [[alternating group]]).

To see that $Alt(\kappa)$ is simple, it is enough to observe that it is a directed colimit of $Alt(X)$ where $X$ ranges over finite subsets of $\kappa$ of cardinality at least $5$; then simplicity of $A_n$ for integers $n \geq 0$, coupled with Proposition \ref{directed}, yields the desired result. 

A rather deeper set of examples is afforded by the following result, which follows from a theorem named after [Baer, Ulam, and Schreier](https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Baer-Schreier-Ulam_theorem). 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
For an infinite set $X$, every proper normal subgroup of the permutation group $Sym(X)$ is contained in a maximal such normal subgroup $N_X$, consisting of all permutations that move fewer than ${|X|}$ many elements of $X$, where ${|X|}$ is the cardinality of $X$. 
=-- 

It follows that the quotient group $Q_X = Sym(X)/N_X$ is simple, and we have the following corollary. 

+-- {: .num_cor} 
###### Corollary 
Every group embeds into a simple group. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
For finite groups $G$ (WLOG, of cardinality at least $3$), we have the Cayley embedding $G \hookrightarrow Sym(G)$ into the permutation group of the underlying set, and there is an embedding $Sym(G) \hookrightarrow Alt(G + 2)$ which carries an even permutation on $G$ to the obvious even permutation on $G + 2$ that fixes the elements $a, b$ of $2$, and an odd permutation $\pi$ on $G$ to the even permutation $\pi (a\; b)$. Hence $G$ embeds in a simple group $Alt(G + 2)$. 

An infinite group $G$ embeds in $Q_G$ via the Cayley embedding 

$$G \hookrightarrow Sym(G) \to Sym(G)/N_G = Q_G$$ 

noting that for any non-identity $g \in G$, the permutation $Cayley(g) = (h \mapsto g h)$ has no fixed points, hence does not belong to $N_G$, so that $G \to Q_G$ is indeed monic. 
=-- 

#### Tarski monsters 

Among the infinite simple groups, there are curious examples called "Tarski monsters" for primes $p$, infinite groups with the property that every subgroup is either trivial, of prime order $p$, or the entire group. Their existence (for all primes $p \gt 10^{75}$, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski_monster_group)) was established only in 1979, by Olshanskii. It may be shown that all such groups must be simple, and generated by two elements, and also that for each prime $p \gt 10^{75}$ there are continuum many monsters for $p$ that are distinct up to isomorphism.

## Definition

An __endomorphism__ of an [[object]] $x$ in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $f : x \to x$.  

An endomorphism that is also an [[isomorphism]] is called an [[automorphism]].


## Properties

Given an object $x$, the endomorphisms of $x$ form a [[monoid]] under [[composition]], the __endomorphism monoid__ of $x$:
$$
  End_C(x) = Hom_C(x,x)
,$$
which may be written $End(x)$ if the category $C$ is understood.  Up to equivalence, every monoid is an endomorphism monoid; see [[delooping]].

An endomorphism monoid is a special case of a monoid structure on an [[end]] construction. Let $d:D\to C$ be a diagram in $C$, where $C$ is a [[monoidal category]] (in the case above the monoidal structure is the [[cartesian product]] and $d$ is a constant diagram from the initial category). One defines $End(d)$ as an object in $C$, equipped with a natural transformation $a: End(d) \otimes d \to d$ which is universal in the sense that for all objects $Z \in C$, and any natural transformation $f: Z \otimes d \to d$ there exists a unique morphism $g: Z \to End(d)$ such $a \circ (g \otimes d) = f: Z \otimes d \to d$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If the universal object $(End(d),a)$ exists then there is a unique structure of an [[internalization|internal]] monoid $\mu: End(d) \otimes End(d) \to End(d)$, such that the map $a: End(d) \otimes d \to d$ is an [[action]]. 
=--

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
In a [[cartesian monoidal category]] $C$, if an endomorphism monoid $End(c)$ for an object $c: 1 \to C$ exists and is [[commutative monoid|commutative]], then $c$ is a [[subterminal object]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $k: c \to End(c)$ correspond to first projection $\pi_1: c \times c \to c$. Then the composition 

$$c \times c \stackrel{k \times k}{\to} End(c) \times End(c) \stackrel{comp}{\to} End(c)$$ 

(where $comp$ denotes internal composition) may be computed to be $k \pi_1$, corresponding to first projection $\pi_1: c \times c \times c \to c$. Thus, assuming commutativity of $End(c)$ and letting $\sigma$ generally denote a symmetry map, consideration of the diagram 

$$\array{
c \times c & \stackrel{k \times k}{\to} & End(c) \times End(c) & \stackrel{comp}{\to} & End(c) \\ 
\mathllap{\sigma} \downarrow & & \mathllap{\sigma} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{id} \\ 
c \times c & \stackrel{k \times k}{\to} & End(c) \times End(c) & \stackrel{comp}{\to} & End(c)
}$$ 

leads to the conclusion that $k \pi_1 = k \pi_1 \sigma$, or $\pi_1 = \pi_2: c \times c \times c \to c$. We easily conclude $\pi_1 = \pi_2: c \times c \to c$, which forces equality $f = g$ for any two maps $f, g: d \to c$, so that the unique map $!: c \to 1$ is a [[monomorphism]].

## Definition

A **finite abelian group** is a [[group]] which is both [[finite group|finite]] and [[abelian group|abelian]].

## Properties

As any [[finite group]], a finite abelian group is [[torsion subgroup|pure torsion]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If a finite abelian group $A$ has [[order of a group|order]] ${\vert A \vert} = p$ a [[prime number]], then it is the [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $A$ is a finite abelian group and $p \in \mathbb{N}$ is a [[prime number]] that divides the [[order of a group|order]] ${\vert A \vert}$, then equivalently

* $A$ has an element of [[order of an element|order]] $p$;

* $A$ has a [[subgroup]] of [[order of a group|order]] $p$.

=--

This is [[Cauchy's theorem]] restricted to abelian groups.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We prodeed by [[induction]] on the [[order of a group|order]] of $A$. For ${\vert A \vert} = 2$ we have that $A = \mathbb{Z}_2$ is the unique [[group of order 2]] and the statement holds for $p =2$. 

Assume then that the statement has been show for groups of order $\lt n$ and let ${\vert A \vert} = n$. 

If $A$ has no non-trivial proper [[subgroup]] then $n$ must be prime and $A = \mathbb{Z}_n$ a [[cyclic group]] and the statement follows.

If $A$ does have a non-trivial proper [[subgroup]] $H \hookrightarrow A$ then $p$ divides either ${\vert H \vert}$ or $\vert A/H\vert$. 

In the first case by [[induction]] assumption $H$ has an element of order $p$ which is therefore also an element of $G$ of order $p$.

In the second case there is by induction assumption an element $a \in A$ such that $a + H \in A/H$ has order $p$. Since the order of $a + H \in A/H$ divides the order of $a \in A$ it follows that $a$ has order $k p$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $k a$ has order $p$.

## Idea

By a *multifunctor* one may mean:

1. a "functor of several variables", i.e., the [[categorification]] of the notion of a *[[multifunction]]*)

1. a *[[morphism of multicategories]]*.


## Functor of several variables

There are at least two ways to generalize the notion of a [[functor]] to the case where its [[domain]] may an [[n-tuple]] of [[categories]]:

1. [jointly functorial maps](#JointlyFunctorialMaps)

1. [separately functorial maps](#SeparatelyFunctorialMaps)

which we discuss in turn.

In all of the following, 

* $D$ denotes a [[category]] which serves as the [[codomain]];

* $C_1, \cdots, C_n$ denotes an [[n-tuple|$n$-tuple]] of categories serving as the multi-[[domain]];

* ${\vert -\vert}$ denotes passage to the [[class]] of [[objects]] of a ([[strict category|strict]]) category.

### Jointly functorial maps
 {#JointlyFunctorialMaps}

A **jointly functorial** [[map]] from $C_1, \cdots, C_n$ to $D$ consists of:

1. a [[multifunction]] on [[objects]] 

   $$

       \,\colon\, 
    \big(
      {|C_1|}, \ldots, {\vert C_n\vert} 
    \big)
      \longrightarrow 
     {|D|}
   $$

2. For all [[n-tuples]] of [[morphisms]] 

   $$
     f_i \,\in\, C_i(a_i,b_i), 
     \;\;\;\;
     1 \leq i \leq n
   $$  

   a morphism of the form

   $$
     F(f_1,\ldots, f_n) 
      \,\colon\, 
     F(a_1,\ldots, a_n) \to F(b_1,\ldots, b_n)
   $$

   in $D$.

such that:

1. [[identity morphisms]] are preserved, in that 

   $$
    F(id_{a_1}, \ldots, id_{a_n}) 
    \;=\; 
    id_{F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)}
   $$

4. [[composition]] is respected, in thay

   $$
     F(f_1 \circ g_1,\ldots, f_n \circ g_n) 
     \;=\; 
     F(f_1,\ldots, f_n) \circ F(g_1,\ldots, g_n)
     \,.
   $$

Such a jointly functorial map is the same as an ordinary [[functor]] out of the [[product category]] of the $n$-tuple of domain categories:

$$
  C_1 \times \cdots \times C_n \longrightarrow D
  \,.
$$

In the case $n = 1$ this is an ordinary functor, while for $n = 2$ this is a "[[bifunctor]]". And if one understands multifunctions of [[zero]] arguments as functions out of the empty product of domain categories, which is the [[terminal category]], then for $n = 0$ this is just a choice of [[object]] of $D$. 


### Separately functorial maps
 {#SeparatelyFunctorialMaps}

On the other hand, rather than requiring an "action" on morphisms from each domain category simultaneously, one may want to require an action of each domain category *separately*, which we could call *separately functorial*. I.e., a separately functorial map $\big(C_1,\ldots, C_n\big) \to D$ consists of:

1. A [[multifunction]] of objects 

   $$
     F 
      \colon 
     \big(
       {|C_1|},\ldots, {\vert C_n\vert}  
     \big)
       \longrightarrow 
     D
   $$

2. Such that for each domain category $C_i$, and objects $a_1,\ldots\widehat{a_i},\ldots, a_n$, the map $F(a_1,\ldots,\widehat {a_i},\ldots, a_n) \colon C_i \to D$ extends to a functor from $C_i$ to $D$.

This definition is instead equivalent to an ordinary functor out of the [[funny tensor product]] of the domain categories 

$$
  C_1 \Box \cdots \Box C_n \longrightarrow D
  \,.
$$

For $n = 0$ and $n = 1$ this definition coincides with that of jointly functorial maps [above](#JointlyFunctorialMaps), bu for $n \geq 2$ arguments it is different.

## Idea

A [[forgetful functor]] from a [[category]] of [[actions]]/[[representations]] to the underlying [[sets]]/[[spaces]] is often called a _[[fiber functor]]_, notably in the context of [[Tannaka duality]] and [[Galois theory]].

The archetypical example which gives rise to the term is the following. If one has the  [[category]] $Et(X)$ of [[covering spaces]]  of a (nice enough) [[topological space]] $X$, then after picking any point $x \in X$ the operation of forming the [[fibre]] over that point gives a [[functor]] $fib_x \colon Et(X)\to Set$ to the category [[Set]] of [[sets]]. The [[natural automorphisms]] of this functor form the (algebraic) [[Chevalley fundamental group|fundamental group]], $\pi_1(X)$. The main theorem of the [[Galois theory|Galois-Poincaré theory]] of [[covering spaces]] can be viewed as stating that this sets up an [[equivalence of categories]] between that category of covering spaces and the category of $\pi_1$[[permutation representation|-sets]]. This equivalence is compatible with the chosen fibre functor and the further [[forgetful functor]] from $\pi_1-Sets$ to $Sets$. Extracting from this situation, that forgetful functor is thought of as being a _fibre functor_ as well.  Any category of [[G-sets]], for $G$ a [[group]], gives a [[monoidal category]], and the forgetful functor is a [[monoidal functor]]; of course, the category of [[G-sets]] corresponds to the category of [[permutation representations]] of $G$, and generalising this basic example leads to the following idea.

The [[forgetful functor|forgetful]] [[strict monoidal functor]] from a [[monoidal category]] to some standard monoidal category, usually the category [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]] over a field is called the __fiber functor__ in some contexts, especially in [[Tannaka reconstruction]] in which the symmetry object is reconstructed from the (object of) endomorphisms of the fiber functor. In mixed Tannaka duality, a single fiber functor does not suffice for reconstruction, but rather a family of fiber functors to different bases. 




Historically, the notion was used extensively, starting in the 1960s by [[Grothendieck]] and his collaborators. The terminology is from the [[Grothendieck Galois theory]]: namely Grothendieck reconstructs the ([[profinite group|profinite]]) [[fundamental group]] in algebraic geometry from a fiber functor: the fundamental group acts on a covering by deck transformations and by monodromy transformation for bundles over the covering, algebraic analogues of such a picture can thus be used to define a fundamental group, not by using some idea of loops which are often hard to define in abstract setups, but by a form of Tannakian reconstruction. Grothendieck also introduced the idea of using many "base points" that is, many fibre functors, thus giving an abstract analogue of the  [[fundamental groupoid]] of a space.

## Warning

Please do not confuse the terminology with the case of a functor which is a [[Grothendieck fibration]] (i.e. a fibered category); nor with a fiber ("preimage" of a sort) of a functor. These are related ideas but are best kept separate.

## Idea

The __free group__ on a given [[set]] $S$ is the [[free object]] on $S$ in [[Grp|the category of groups]].  The elements of $S$ are called the __generators__ of this group.

## Definition

### In type theory

In [[dependent type theory]], the free group on a type $A$ is the [[0-truncation]] of the [[underlying type of free infinity-group]] of $A$, $\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A) \coloneqq [\mathrm{UTFIG}(A)]_0$. This is because in any dependent type theory with [[uniqueness of identity proofs]], where every type is 0-truncated, the underlying type of the free infinity-group of $A$ is the free group of $A$. 

In addition, one could construct the free group directly from the traditional axioms of a [[group]], as detailed below:

#### Rules for free groups

Formation rules for free groups:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{FreeGroup}(A) \; \mathrm{type}}$$

Introduction rules for free groups:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \eta:A \to \mathrm{FreeGroup}(A) \; \mathrm{type}} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \mu:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A) \times \mathrm{FreeGroup}(A) \to \mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \epsilon:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \iota:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A) \to \mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash x:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A) \quad \Gamma \vdash y:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A) \quad \Gamma \vdash z:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}{\Gamma \vdash \alpha(x, y, z):\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}(\mu(x, \mu(y, z)),\mu(\mu(x, y), z))}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash x:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}{\Gamma \vdash \lambda_\epsilon(x):\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}(\mu(\epsilon, x), x)} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash x:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}{\Gamma \vdash \rho_\epsilon(x):\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}(\mu(x, \epsilon), x)}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash x:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}{\Gamma \vdash \lambda_\iota(x):\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}\mu(\iota(x), x),  \epsilon)} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash x:\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}{\Gamma\vdash \rho_\iota(x):\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A)}(\mu(x, \iota(x)), \epsilon)}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \tau:\mathrm{isSet}(\mathrm{FreeGroup}(A))}$$

## Properties

Every [[subgroup]] of a free group is itself a free group. This is the _[[Nielsen-Schreier theorem]]_.

> This entry is about the generating functions in the sense of algebraic combinatorics. For another notion see [[generating function in classical mechanics]]. 

#Contents#
* table of contents
{:toc}

## Idea

A _generating function_ is an element of $R[\![z]\!]$, the [[rig]] of formal [[power series]] over the rig $R$ (which is often taken to be the [[natural numbers]] or the [[rational number]]s), used for purposes of [[combinatorics]].  A general element takes the form
\[f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f_n z^n.\]
If $R$ is taken to be the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]] (or any subrig), then we can ask whether the power series has a radius of convergence $r \ge 0$ and if there's an [[analytic continuation]]; if so, then we also say that the continuation is the generating function.

When $R = \mathbb{N},$ we can think of the coefficients on $z^n$ as counting the number of ways to put a particular structure on the [[finite set]] $n$.  (You get [[structure types]] if you take this literally.)  

Multiplying generating functions in the same variable gives
\[ \left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f_n z^n\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}g_n z^n\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^n f_k g_{n-k} z^n,\]
which effectively says to split up the set into two parts, put the $f$ structure on the first part and the $g$ structure on the second part.

_Ordinary_ generating functions (OGFs) describe structures on [[totally ordered sets]], while _exponential_ generating functions (EGFs) apply to unordered [[sets]] (whose elements may be distinguished by having different _labels_).  For example, the generating function for being an unordered finite set is
\[ e^z = 1 + z + \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^3}{3!} + \cdots ,\]
while the generating function for being a finite ordered set is
\[ \frac{1}{1-z} = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + \cdots .\]

If we assume that the zeroth term is $1$, then multiplying generating functions in different variables gives
\[ \left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f_n x^n\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}g_n z^n\right) = 1 + (f_1 x + g_1 z) + (f_2 x^2 + f_1 g_1 x z + g_2 z^2) + \cdots\]
If we take the product of countably many generating functions $f^i(x_i)$ and then set $x_i = p_i^{-s},$ where $p_i$ is the $i$th prime, then we get
\[ 1^{-s} + f^1_1 2^{-s} + f^2_1 3^{-s} + f^1_2 4^{-s} + f^3_1 5^{-s} + f^1_1 f^2_1 6^{-s} + \cdots + \prod_{i} f^i_{e_i} (p_i^{e_i})^{-s} + \cdots, \]
which is called the _Dirichlet_ generating function for the family $f^i.$

The product of two Dirichlet generating functions gives
\[ \left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_n n^{-s}\right)\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}g_n n^{-s}\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{d|n} f_d g_{n/d} n^{-s},\]
which effectively says to _factor_ the term into two dimensions, apply $f$ to the first and $g$ to the second.

Sometimes we take the *exponents* on $z$ to be in a rig other than the natural numbers.  For example, we might set $z^a \cdot z^b = z^{\max(a,b)}$ and $(z^a)^b = z^{a+b};$ such a system lets us talk about the [[rig of costs|cost]] of operations done in parallel (max) or sequentially (+).  Similarly, we could take the exponents to be [[binary string]]s when considering instantaneous codes, or [[finite field]] elements when considering structures on a finite collection of objects.


## Examples

The OGF $T(z)$ for binary [[trees]] (rooted in the plane, counted by number of internal nodes) satisfies $T(z) = 1 + z T(z)^2$, which can be solved as $T(z) = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4z}}{2z}$.  The coefficient of $z^n$ in $T(z)$ is the $n$th _Catalan number_ $\binom{2n}{n}/(n+1)$.

Fixed-point free [[involutions]] on a set have the EGF $e^{z^2/2}$, while arbitrary involutions have EGF $e^{z+z^2/2}$, and  [[partition#of_sets|partitions]] have EGF $e^{e^z-1}$.

In [[quantum field theory]] generating functions often appear as [[partition functions]] and [[vacuum amplitudes]] as functions of [[source fields]].

## Definition

A _topological ring_ is a [[ring]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Top]], a [[ring object]] in [[Top]]:

a [[topological space]] $R$ equipped with the structure of a [[ring]] on its underlying [[set]], such that [[addition]] $+$ and [[multiplication]] $\cdot$ are [[continuous functions]]. 

Remarks:

* The structure of a topological ring $(R,+,\cdot)$ makes $R$ a [[uniform space]]. 

* It is automatic that negation in a topological unital ring is continuous, since it is the operation of multiplication with $-1$, and multiplication is continuous in each argument. Hence for $(R,+,\cdot)$ a topological ring, then $(R,+)$ is a [[topological group]].

* A _[[topological field]]_ is a topological ring $K$ whose underlying ring is in fact a [[field]] and such that reciprocation $(-)^{-1}: K \setminus \{0\} \to K \setminus \{0\}$ is continuous. This latter condition is the same as demanding that the subspace topology on $K \setminus \{0\}$ induced by the embedding $K \setminus \{0\} \hookrightarrow K$ coincide with the subspace topology induced by the embedding $K \setminus \{0\} \to K \times K: x \mapsto (x, x^{-1})$. More at [[topological field]]. 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
In a topological ring, the closure of $\{0\}$ is an [[ideal]]. It follows that for a topological field $F$, either $0$ is a closed point (so that $F$ is $T_1$ and therefore [[Tychonoff space|completely regular Hausdorff]], by standard arguments in the theory of uniform spaces), or is a [[codiscrete space]]. 
=-- 

A [[topological algebra]] over a topological ring $R$ is a topological ring $S$ together with a topological ring map $R \to S$ that makes $S$ an $R$-algebra at the underlying set level (a topological [[associative algebra]]). 


## Examples

* The [[real numbers]] form a topological field.

* Any [[pseudocompact ring]] such as the completed [[group ring]] of a [[profinite group]] is a topological ring.

*  For any prime $p$, the ring of [[p-adic integers]] is a topological ring.
  
* A [[Banach algebra]] is in particular a [[topological algebra]], hence a topological ring. Hence so is a [[C-star-algebra]].

## Idea

The _group algebra_ of a [[group]] $G$ over a [[ring]] $R$ is the [[associative algebra]] whose elements are [[formal linear combinations]] over $R$ of the elements of $G$ and whose multiplication is given on these [[basis]] elements by the group operation in $G$. 



## Definition



### For discrete groups
 {#ForDiscreteGroups}

Let $G$ be a [[discrete group]]. Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The **group $R$-algebra** $R[G]$ is the [[associative algebra]] over $R$ 

1. whose underlying $R$-[[module]] is the the [[free module]] over $R$ on the underlying set of $G$;

1. whose multiplication is given on [[basis]] elements by the group operation.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

By the discussion at [[free module]] an element $r$ in $R[G]$ is a [[formal linear combination]] of [[basis]] elements in $G$ with [[coefficients]] in $R$, hence a formal sum

$$
  r = \sum_{g \in G} r_g \cdot g
$$

with $\forall_{g \in G} (r_g \in R)$ and only finitely many of the coefficients different from $0 \in R$.

The addition of algebra elements is given by the componentwise addition of coefficients

$$
  r + \tilde r = 
  \sum_{g \in G} (r_g + \tilde r_g) g
$$

and the multiplication is given by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    r \tilde r 
    & =
    \sum_{g \in G} 
      \sum_{\tilde g \in G} (r_g \tilde r_{\tilde g}) g \cdot \tilde g
    \\
    & =
    \sum_{q \in G} 
    \left(
      \sum_{k \in G}  (r_{q\cdot k^{-1}} r_k) 
    \right) q
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The [[formal linear combinations]] over $R$ of element in $G$ may equivalently be thought of as [[functions]]

$$
  r_{(-)} \colon U(G) \to U(R)
$$

from the underlying set of $G$ to the underlying set of $R$ which have _finite support_. Accordingly,  often the underlying set of the group $R$-algebra is written as

$$
  U(R[G]) = Hom_{Set}^{fin\;supp}(U(G), U(R))
$$

and for the [[basis elements]] one writes

$$
  \chi_g \colon U(G) \to U(R)
  \,,
$$

the **characteristic function** of an element $g \in G$, defined by

$$
  \chi_g \colon \tilde g \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      1 & | g = \tilde g
      \\
      0 & | otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

In terms of this the product in the group algebra is called the **[[convolution product]]** on functions. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The notion of group algebra is a special case of that of a [[groupoid algebra]], hence of [[category algebra]].

###For profinite groups

The completed group ring of a [[profinite group]] is a pseudocompact ring.
Let $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the [[profinite completion]] of the ring of integers, $\mathbb{Z}$, then $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$  is itself a [[pseudocompact ring]] as it is the inverse limit of its _finite_ quotients.  Now let $G$ be a profinite group.


The _completed group algebra_, $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}[\![G]\!]$, of $G$ over $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ is the inverse limit of the ordinary group algebras, $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}[G/U] $, of the finite quotients, $G/U$ (for $U$ in the directed set, $\Omega(G)$, of open normal subgroups of $G$), over $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$;

$$\hat{\mathbb{Z}}[\![G]\!] = lim_{U\in \Omega(G)} \hat{\mathbb{Z}}[G/U].$$

For $R$ a pseudocompact ring, it is then easy to construct the corresponding pseudo-compact group algebra of $G$ over $R$; see the paper by Brumer.

###### Remark

Let $V$ be an [[abelian group]]. A [[homomorphism]] of rings $R[G] \to End(V)$ of the group ring to the [[endomorphism ring]] of $V$ is equivalently a $R[G]$-[[module]] structure on $V$. 

Any [[homomorphism]] of groups $p \colon G \to Aut(V)$ to the [[automorphism group]] of $V$ extends to to a morphism of rings. 

This observation is used extensively in the theory of [[group representation|group representations]]. See also at _[module -- Abelian groups with G-action as modules over a ring ](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/module#AbelianGroupsWithGAction)_.

\begin{prop}\label{ComplexGroupAlgebraOfFiniteGroupAsDirectSumOfEndomorphismAlgebras}
  For $G$ a [[finite group]] with [[isomorphism classes]] of [[irreducible representations]] $[V] \in Irreps_{\mathbb{C}}(G)_{/\sim}$ over the [[complex numbers]], the complex [[group algebra]] of $G$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[direct sum]] of the linear [[endomorphism algebras]] of the [[complex vector spaces]] underlying the [[irreps]]:
$$
  \mathbb{C}[G]
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{
    [V] \in Irreps_{\mathbb{C}}(G)_{/\sim}
  }{ \oplus }
  End_{\mathbb{C}}(V)
$$ 
\end{prop}
(e.g. [Fulton-Harris 91, Prop. 3.29](#FultonHarris91))
\begin{proof}
  For every representation $V$, the defining [[group action]]
  $$
    G 
      \overset{}{\longrightarrow} 
    Aut_{\mathbb{C}}(V) 
      \hookrightarrow
    End_{\mathbb{C}}(V)
  $$
  [[extension|extends]] uniquely to an [[algebra homomorphism]]
  $$
    \mathbb{C}[G]
      \overset{ \phi_V }{\longrightarrow} 
    End_{\mathbb{C}}(V)
    \,.
  $$
  Observe that this is a [[surjection]], since if it were not then we could split off a  non-trivial [[cokernel]], contradicting the assumption that $V$ is irreducible.

  We claim that the resulting homomorphism to the [[direct sum]]
  $$
    \mathbb{C}[G]
      \overset{ (\phi_V)_{[V]} }{\longrightarrow} 
    \underset{
      [V] \in Irreps_{\mathbb{C}}(G)_{/\sim}
    }{\oplus} 
    End_{\mathbb{C}}(V)
  $$
  is an [[isomorphism]]: By the previous comment it is sujective, hence it is sufficient to observe that the [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of the group algebra equals that of the right hand side, hence that
$$
  dim\big( 
    \mathbb{C}[Sym(G)]
  \big)
  \;=\;
  \underset{[V]}{\sum} \big( dim(V)\big)^2
  \,.
$$ 
This is the case by [this property](regular+representation#RegularRepDecomposedIntoIrreps) of the [[regular representation]].
\end{proof}

###### Theorem
([[Maschke's theorem]])

Let $G$ be a [[finite group]], let $R = k$ be a field.

Then $k[G]$ is a [[semi-simple algebra]] precisely if the [[order]] of $G$ is not divisible by the [[characteristic]] of k.
