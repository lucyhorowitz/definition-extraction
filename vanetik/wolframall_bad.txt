An epitrochoid appears in D?rer 's work Instruction in Measurement with Compasses and Straight Edge in 1525 .

 These two statements are equivalent formulations of the definition of the limit ( lim_(x->x_0 ) f(x ) = y_0 ) .
In the second one , the neighborhood U is replaced by the open interval ( y_0 - ? , y_0 + ? ) , and the neighborhood V by the open interval ( x_0 - ? , x_0 + ? ) .
For a function of n variables , the absolute value would be replaced by the norm left double bracketing bar � right double bracketing bar of R^n , and the open intervals by the open balls B(y_0 , ? ) and B(x_0 , ? ) respectively .
This does not affect the meaning of the statement , since every neighborhood of a given point contains an open ball centered at that point .
Hence requiring that , for any ?>0 , f(x ) element B(y_0 , ? ) for suitable values of x , ensures that for suitable values of x , f(x ) element U for any neighborhood U of y_0 .
These suitable values of x are , according to both versions of the definition , those belonging to a suitable neighborhood ( an open ball in the second one ) .
Both statements express the fact that for all x which lie close enough to x_0 , f(x ) lies as close to y_0 as desired .
  In the second formulation this condition is entirely expressed in terms of numbers : ? and ? are distances that measures the " closeness . " 
This facilitates the task of proving limits since the fundamental formulas are actually shown by constructing , for every ? , a ? with the required property .

  Simplifying the above identity , ϕ is thus the unique positive real number for which ϕ^2 = ϕ + 1 .
Dividing both sides by ϕ yields ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ and thereby yields a recursive definition of ϕ whose first few terms have the form ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/ϕ ) = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/ϕ ) ) ....

Connecting the intersections of the arcs then gives the perpendicular bisector CD .
  Furthermore , if A has exactly p eigenvalues ( p<=n ) on the circle left bracketing bar z right bracketing bar = R , then the set of all its eigenvalues is invariant under rotations by 2? / p about the origin .

Two planes always intersect in a line as long as they are not parallel .
Let the planes be specified in Hessian normal form , then the line of intersection must be perpendicular to both ( n_1)^^ and ( n_2)^^ , which means it is parallel to a = ( n_1)^^x(n_2)^^ .

Consider the expression 3�7 + 2 ^ 2 .
  This expression has value ( 3�7 ) + ( 2 ^ 2 ) = 25 due to what is called operator precedence ( or " order of operations " ) .

There are q - analogs of the factorial , binomial coefficient , derivative , integral , Fibonacci numbers , and so on .
Koornwinder , Suslov , and Bustoz , have even managed some kind of q - Fourier analysis .
To avoid this ambiguity ( as well as the pitfall that there are sometimes more than just a single q - analog ) , the term q - extension ( Andrews et al . 1999 , pp . 483 , 485 , 487 , etc . ) may be preferable .
  q - analogs are based on the observation that lim_(q->1 ^ - ) ( 1 - q^?)/(1 - q ) = ? , and the quantity ( 1 - q^?)/(1 - q ) is sometimes written [ ? ] .
q - analogs provided the basis for the Askey - Wilson classification of all orthogonal polynomials .
A physical motivation for q - special functions is provided by generalizing the canonical commutation relation xp - px = 1 , where x is a generalized coordinate and p the corresponding generalized momentum , to xp - qpx = 1 .
  q - analogs preserve ( or change only slightly ) the form of the governing functional equations , and therefore arise in many physical applications , such as exact models in statistical mechanics , noncommutative geometry , and many - particle systems .
q - analogs also have a combinatorial interpretation based on the fact that one can count the elements of some set S to get the number # S.
  This relationship can be summarized by writing a polynomial in a new variable , usually taken as q , where the coefficient of q^n is # { s element S : f(s ) = n } .
Evaluating the polynomial at q = 1 then adds the coefficients together , returning the original # S.

Other types of analogs are also defined , for example the d - analog .

A : Someone who can not distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup .
There is more to topology , though .
Topology began with the study of curves , surfaces , and other objects in the plane and three - space .
One of the central ideas in topology is that spatial objects like circles and spheres can be treated as objects in their own right , and knowledge of objects is independent of how they are " represented " or " embedded " in space .
Topology has to do with the study of spatial objects such as curves , surfaces , the space we call our universe , the space - time of general relativity , fractals , knots , manifolds ( which are objects with some of the same basic spatial properties as our universe ) , phase spaces that are encountered in physics ( such as the space of hand - positions of a clock ) , symmetry groups like the collection of ways of rotating a top , etc .
Topology can be used to abstract the inherent connectivity of objects while ignoring their detailed form .
  In these figures , parallel edges drawn in solid join one another with the orientation indicated with arrows , so corners labeled with the same letter correspond to the same point , and dashed lines show edges that remain free ( Gardner 1971 , pp . 15 - 17 ; Gray 1997 , pp . 322 - 324 ) .
The above figures correspond to the disk ( plane ) , Klein bottle , Möbius strip , real projective plane , sphere , torus , and tube .
The labels are often omitted in such diagrams since they are implied by connection of parallel lines with the orientations indicated by the arrows .
Topology can be divided into algebraic topology ( which includes combinatorial topology ) , differential topology , and low - dimensional topology .
There is also a formal definition for a topology defined in terms of set operations .
The ( trivial ) subsets X and the empty set ∅ are in T .
This definition can be used to enumerate the topologies on n symbols .

In French , the term " corps non commutatif " is used to mean division algebra , while " corps " alone means field .
  The uniqueness of division breaks down when dividing by zero , since the product 0·y = 0 is the same for any y , so y can not be recovered by inverting the process of multiplication .
  0 is the only number with this property and , as a result , division by zero is undefined for real numbers and can produce a fatal condition called a " division by zero error " in computer programs .

While the image appears to be a spiral formed by a rope containing twisted strands of two different colors , it actually consists of concentric circles of twisted cords .
The visual distortion is produced by combining a regular line pattern ( the circles ) with misaligned parts ( the differently colored strands ) .

Then a closed subset F of S is called a fundamental domain of G in S if S is the union of conjugates of F , i.e. , S = union _ ( g element G ) gF , and the intersection of any two conjugates has no interior .
For example , a fundamental domain of the group of rotations by multiples of 180 ° in R^2 is the upper half - plane { ( x , y)|y>=0 } and a fundamental domain of rotations by multiples of 90 ° is the first quadrant { ( x , y)|x , y>=0 } .

It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced nails ( or pegs ) driven into its upper half , where the nails are arranged in staggered order , and a lower half divided into a number of evenly - spaced rectangular slots .
The front of the device is covered with a glass cover to allow viewing of both nails and slots .
In the middle of the upper edge , there is a funnel into which balls can be poured , where the diameter of the balls must be much smaller than the distance between the nails .
The funnel is located precisely above the central nail of the second row so that each ball , if perfectly centered , would fall vertically and directly onto the uppermost point of this nail 's surface .
The figure above shows a variant of the board in which only the nails that can potentially be hit by a ball dropped from the funnel are included , leading to a triangular array instead of a rectangular one .
Each time a ball hits one of the nails , it can bounce right ( or left ) with some probability p ( and q = 1 - p ) .
  For symmetrically placed nails , balls will bounce left or right with equal probability , so p = q = 1/2 .
  Each ball crosses the bottom row hitting the nth peg from the left ( where 0<=n<=N - 1 ) iff it has taken exactly n right turns , which occurs with probability P_p(n|N ) = ( N n ) p^n q^(N - n ) .
This process therefore gives rise to a binomial distribution of in the heights of heaps of balls in the lower slots .
Some care is needed to obtain these idealized results , however , as the actual distribution of balls depends on physical properties of the setup , including the elasticity of the balls ( as characterized by their coefficient of restitution ) , the radius of the nails , and the offsets of the balls over the funnel 's opening when they are dropped .
Let two players each have a finite number of pennies ( say , n_1 for player one and n_2 for player two ) .
Now , flip one of the pennies ( from either player ) , with each player having 50 % probability of winning , and transfer a penny from the loser to the winner .
Now repeat the process until one player has all the pennies .
If the process is repeated indefinitely , the probability that one of the two player will eventually lose all his pennies must be 100 % .

A bridge is also known as an isthmus , cut - edge , or cut arc .
Every edge of a tree is a bridge .
A connected cubic graph contains a bridge iff it contains an articulation vertex , i.e. , if it is not a biconnected graph .
Garey and Johnson ( 1983ab ) showed that determining the crossing number is an NP - complete problem .
The above figure shows the first several circular embeddings of the cubical graph .
The most commonly encountered graph embeddings are generally straight line drawings , in which all edges are drawn as straight line segments .
While the underlying object is independent of the embedding , a clever choice of embedding can lead to particularly illuminating diagrams .
For example , the circular ( left ) embedding of the cubical graph illustrates this graph 's inherent symmetries .
